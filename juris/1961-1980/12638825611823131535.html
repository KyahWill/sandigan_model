				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an agrarian case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three
questions of consequential effects are raised:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>first</u>, is there a tenant's right of redemption in sugar and
coconut lands; <u>second,</u> is prior tender or judicial consignation of the
redemption price a condition precedent for the valid exercise of the right of
redemption; and <u>third</u>, does the Court of Agrarian Relations have
jurisdiction over complaints for redemption of sugar and coconut lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Gonzales is an
agricultural share tenant of <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sinfroso</span>, Susana, Maria, Sebastian, <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>, <span class="SpellE">Besmark</span> and
Cesar, all surnamed Angeles, on their 46,529-square land situated in <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, and devoted to
sugar cane and coconuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1968</st1:date>, the landowners
sold the property to petitioners-spouses <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span>
Laurel <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> without notifying respondent-tenant in writing of
the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The document of sale was
registered with the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> on <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="3">March
 27, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent-tenant
thus seeks the redemption of the land in a complaint filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1971</st1:date>, pursuant to the
provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of the Code of Agrarian Reforms, with the

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, petitioners-spouses state, among other
things, that long before the execution of the deed of sale, <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span>
Angeles and his nephew Cesar Angeles first offered the sale of the land to
respondent Gonzales, but the latter said that he had no money; that
respondent-tenant, instead, went personally to the house of petitioners-spouses
and implored them to buy the land for fear that if someone else would buy the
land, he may not be taken in as tenant; that respondent-tenant is a mere dummy
of someone deeply interested in buying the land; that respondent-tenant made no
tender of payment or any valid consignation in court at the time he filed the
complaint for redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="5">May
 29, 1973</st1:date>, the parties waived their right to present evidence and,
instead, agreed to file simultaneous memoranda upon which the decision of the
court would be based.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1973</st1:date>,
the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street> rendered
judgment authorizing the respondent-tenant, <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
Gonzales, to redeem the tenanted land for P24,000.00, the said amount to be
deposited by him with the Clerk of Court within fifteen (15) days from receipt
of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners-spouses excepted to the ruling of the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian

Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>, the Appellate Court, however,
affirmed the decision of the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Denied of their motions for reconsideration,
petitioners-spouses instituted the present petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the appeal to be
impressed with merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. Prior to the enactment of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (RA
3844), no right of preference in the sale of the land under cultivation was
enjoyed by the tenant-farmer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
absence of this right freely opened the way to the landlords to ease out their
tenants from the land by ostensible conveyance of said land to another <span style="">tenant </span><span style="">who, in turn, sues for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the first tenant on ground of personal
cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While many of these sales
were simulated, the tenant is <span class="SpellE">oftenly</span> evicted </span>from
the land because of the formal transfer of ownership in the land.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On August 8, 1963, the Agricultural Land Reform Code was passed, impressed with
the policy of the State, among other things, "(t)o establish owner-<span class="SpellE">cultivatorship</span> and the economic family-size farm as the
basis of Philippine agriculture; to achieve a dignified existence for the small
farmers free from pernicious institutional restraints and practices; to make
the small farmers more independent, self-reliant and responsible citizens, and
a source of genuine strength in our democratic society."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
More importantly, a new right was given to the tenants-farmers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the right of pre-emption and redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bolsters their security of tenure and
further encourages them to become owner-cultivators.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, Section 11 provides: "In case the agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
decides to sell the landholding, the agricultural lessee shall have the
preferential right to buy the same under reasonable terms and conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right of pre-emption under this Section may be exercised within one
hundred eighty days from notice in writing, which shall be served by the owner
on all lessees affected and the Department of Agrarian Reform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the agricultural lessee agrees with the
terms and conditions of the sale, he must give notice in writing to the
agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of his intention to exercise his
right of pre-emption within the balance of one hundred eighty days' period
still available to him, but in any case not less than thirty days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He must either tender payment of, or
present a certificate from the land bank that it shall make payment pursuant to
section eighty of this Code on the price of the landholding to the agricultural
</u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lessor</span></u></span><u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the latter refuses to accept such tender or pre</span>sentment, he may consign
it with the court.</u>‚Äù As protection of this right, Section 12 was inserted:
"In case the landholding is sold to a third person without the knowledge
of the agricultural lessee, the latter shall have the right to redeem the same
at a reasonable price and consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The right of redemption under this section may be exercised within one
hundred eighty days from notice in writing which shall be served by the vendee
on all lessees affected and the Department of Agrarian Reform upon the
registration of the sale, and shall have priority over any other right of legal
redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The redemption price shall
be the reasonable price of the land at the time of the sale."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the <span class="SpellE">precedential</span>

tenants and <u>share</u> tenants.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Presently, We are faced with an intricate question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is this right of redemption available to
tenants in <u>sugar</u> and <u>coconut</u> lands?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We answer yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among those exempted from the automatic
conversion to agricultural leasehold upon the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the Agricultural Land Reform Code in 1963 or even after its amendments (Code
of Agrarian Reforms) are sugar lands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 4 thereof states: "<u>Agricultural share tenancy</u>
throughout the country, as herein defined, is hereby declared contrary to
public policy and shall be automatically converted to agricultural leasehold
upon the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Provided</u>, That in order not to jeopardize international
commitments, lands devoted to crops <u>covered by marketing allotments</u>
shall be made the subject of a separate proclamation by the President upon
recommendation of the department head that adequate provisions, such as the
organization of cooperatives marketing agreement, or <span style="">similar </span>other workable arrangements, have been made to insure
efficient management on all matters requiring synchronization of the
agricultural with the processing phases of such crops * * * *." Sugar <span style="">is, </span>of course, one crop covered by
marketing allotments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
this section recognizes <u>share</u> tenancy in sugar lands <u>until</u> after
a special proclamation is made, which proclamation shall have the same effect
of an executive proclamation of the operation of the Department of Agrarian
Reform in any region or locality:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
share tenants in the lands affected will become agricultural lessees at the
beginning of the<span style=""> agricultural year next
succeeding the year in which the proclamation is made.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But, there is <u>nothing</u> readable </span>or
even discernible in the law <u>denying</u> to tenants in sugar lands the right
of pre-emption and redemption under the Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The exemption is purely limited to the <u>tenancy system</u>; it does
not exclude the other rights conferred by the Code, such as the right of
pre-emption and redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same
manner, coconut lands are exempted from the Code <u>only</u> with respect to
the consideration and tenancy system prevailing, implying that in other matters
‚Äì the right of pre-emption and redemption which does not refer to the
consideration of the tenancy - the provisions of the Code apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section 35 states:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Sections, in the case of
fishponds, <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and lands principally planted to
citrus, <u>coconuts,</u> cacao, coffee, durian, and other similar permanent
trees at the time of the approval of this Code, the <u>consideration</u>, as
well as the <u>tenancy</u> <u>system</u> prevailing, shall be governed by the
provisions of Republic Act Numbered Eleven Hundred and Ninety-Nine, as
amended."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that under the new Constitution, property
ownership is impressed with social function.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Property use must not only be for the benefit of the owner but of
society as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State, in the
promotion of social justice, may "regulate the acquisition, ownership,
use, enjoyment and disposition of <u>private</u> property, and equitably
diffuse property . . . . . . ownership and profits."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
One governmental policy of recent date projects the emancipation of tenants
from the bondage of the soil and the transfer to them of the ownership of the
land they till.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is Presidential
Decree No. 27 of October 21, 1972, ordaining that all tenant farmers "of
private agricultural lands devoted to rice and corn under a system of share¬≠crop
or lease-tenancy, whether classified as landed estates or <span style="">not" shall be deemed "<u>owner</u>
of a portion constituting a family-size farm of five (5) hectares if not
irrigated and three (3) hectares if irrigated."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2. </span>N<span style="">evertheless, while the Code secures to the </span>tenant-farmer this
right of redemption, in particular, the exercise thereof must be in accordance
with law in order to be valid.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span>"The timely exercise of the right of legal
redemption," said the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Basbas</u></span><u>
v. <span class="SpellE">Entena</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
"requires either tender of the price or valid consignation thereof."
The statutory periods within which the right must be exercised "would be
rendered meaningless and of easy evasion unless the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
is required to make an actual tender in good faith of what he believed to be
reasonable price of the land sought to be redeemed." "The existence
of the right of redemption operates to depress the market value of the land
until the period expires, and to render that period indefinite by permitting
the tenant to file a suit for redemption, with either party unable to foresee
when final judgment will terminate the action, would render nugatory the period
of two years (180 days under the new law) fixed by the statute for making the
redemption and virtually paralyze any efforts of the landowner to realize the
value of his land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No buyer can be
expected to acquire it without any certainty as to the amount for which it may
be redeemed, so that he can recover at least his investment in case of
redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the
landowner's needs and obligations cannot be met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is doubtful if any such result was
intended by the statute, absent clear wording to that effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Bona-fide redemption <u>necessarily</u> imports a seasonable and valid <u>tender</u>
of the entire repurchase price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
right of a <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> to pay a "reasonable
price" does <u>not</u> excuse him from the duty to make proper tender of
the price that can be honestly deemed reasonable under the circumstances,
without prejudice to final arbitration by the courts. "It is not difficult
to discern why the redemption price should either be fully offered in legal
tender or else validly consigned in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only by such means can the buyer become certain that the offer to redeem
is one made seriously and in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A buyer cannot be expected to entertain an offer of redemption without
attendant evidence that the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> can, and is
willing to accomplish the <span style="">repurchase
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A different rule would
leave the buyer open to harassment by speculators or crackpots, as well as to
unnecessary prolongation of the redemption period, contrary to the policy of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While consignation of the
tendered price is not always necessary because legal redemption is not made to
discharge a pre-existing debt (Asturias Sugar Central v. Cane Molasses Co., 60
Phil. 253), <u>a valid tender is indispensable</u>, for the reasons already
stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, consignation of the
price would remove all controversy as to the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner's</span>
ability to pay at the proper time.‚Äù</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before Us, neither prior tender nor judicial
consignation of the redemption price accompanied the filing of the redemption
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the Agrarian Court had
yet to order, when it rendered its decision on October 10, 1973 (complaint was
filed on March 27, 1971), respondent-tenant to deposit the amount of P24,000.00
as redemption price with the Clerk of Court within fifteen (15) days from
receipt of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of
such tender or consignation leaves Us, therefore, with no alternative but to
declare that respondent-tenant had failed to exercise his right of redemption
in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Reliance cannot be placed upon the case of <u>Hidalgo v.
Hidalgo</u><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as excuse for the failure to make the requisite tender or consignation in
court, <u>because</u> the Court did <u>not</u> rule therein that prior tender
or judicial consignation of the redemption price is not required for the valid
exercise of the right of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that case, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Igmidio</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state>
<span style="">and </span>Martina Rosales were the <u>share</u>
tenants of <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state>
on his 22,876-square meter agricultural land in <span class="SpellE">Lumil</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
while the spouses <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> Hidalgo were his tenants on a 7,638-square
meter land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
<st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state> sold these lands without
notifying his tenants; and so, the tenants filed petitions before the Court of <span style="">Agrarian Relations seeking the redemption of
the lands under Section 12 of the Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Agrarian Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> dismissed the petitions for the reason that
the right of redemption is available to <u>leasehold</u> tenants only but not
to share tenants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On review, the Court
ruled that while the Agrarian Court "<u>correctly</u> focused on the <u>sole
issue of law</u>" - whether the </span>right of redemption granted by
Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844 is applicable to <u>share</u> tenants - it
(Agrarian Court) "arrived at its <u>erroneous </u>conclusion that the
right of redemption granted by Section 12 of the Land Reform Code is available
to leasehold tenants only but not to share tenants." The Court said that
"(t)he Code intended * * * to afford the farmers who <u>transitionally </u>continued
to be share tenants after its enactment but who inexorably would be
agricultural lessees by virtue of the Code's proclaimed abolition of tenancy,
the same priority and preferential right as those <u>other share tenants,</u>
who upon the enactment of the Code or soon thereafter were <u>earlier converted
by fortuitous circumstance</u> into agricultural lessees, to acquire the lands
under their cultivation in the event of their voluntary sale by the owner or of
their acquisition, by expropriation or otherwise, by the Land Authority." <u>But</u>,
the Court did <u>not</u> rule that tender of payment or consignation of the
redemption price in court is not a requisite in the valid exercise of the right
of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it said that
"(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)n the absence of any provision in the Code
as to the <u>manner</u> of and amounts payable on redemption, the pertinent
provisions of the Civil Code apply in a <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span>
character" which, of course, imposes tender of payment or judicial consignation
of the repurchase price as condition for valid redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is noteworthy that in that case
petitioners-tenants' possession of funds and <u>compliance with the
requirements of redemption</u> were <u>not</u> questioned, the case having been
submitted and decided on the <u>sole</u> legal issue of the right of redemption
being available to them as share tenants.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. As a consequence, the Court of Agrarian Relations has
jurisdiction over suits for redemption, like the present case, of sugar and
coconut lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 154 of the Agricultural
Land Reform Code, as amended, states: "The Court of Agrarian Relations
shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over (1) all cases or actions
involving <u>matters</u>, <u>controversies</u>, <u>disputes</u>,<u> </u>or <u>money</u>
claims <u>arising from agrarian relations</u> * * * *." Since this case
involves a matter, controversy or dispute "arising from agrarian
relations" - whether respondent-tenant on sugar and coconut lands has the
right of redemption - it is definite that the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> has jurisdiction to hear and decide the
same.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court of Agrarian Relations came into being for the enforcement of all laws
and regulations governing the relations between capital and labor on all
agricultural lands under any system of cultivation with original and exclusive
jurisdiction over the entire Philippines, to consider, investigate, decide and
settle all questions, matters, controversies, or disputes involving or arising
from such relationship.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>
