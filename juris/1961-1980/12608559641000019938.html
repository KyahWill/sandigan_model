				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Original action for a writ of certiorari to annul a decision and an order 
issued by respondent, Hon. Jose T. Surtida, as Judge of the Court of First 
Instance of Camarines Sur, in Civil Case No. 4457 thereof, entitled "Rufina 
Subastil <i>vs</i>. Luciano Valencia and Francisca Ocampo".
<p>In the complaint filed therein, on or about February 14, 1959, Rufina 
Subastil, the main respondent herein, alleged that she is the owner and 
possessor of a riceland situated in Sampaloc, Gainza, Camarines Sur, and more 
particularly described in said pleading; that, at the inception of the 
agricultural season, sometime in July, 1950, defendants therein, namely, Luciano 
Valencia and Francisco Ocampo, husband and wife, who are petitioners herein, 
entered into a verbal contract with her whereby they agreed to cultivate the 
southern portion of said lot and pay her five (5) cavanes of clean palay, by way 
of rental for each agricultural year; and that, after complying with this 
obligation during the year 1950-1951, petitioners thereafter failed and refused 
to do so, as well as to vacate the land, despite repeated demands, for which 
reason Rufina Subastil prayed that petitioners be sentenced to vacate the land 
and deliver the same to her, as well as to pay her the equivalent of the 
unsatisfied rentals and those which may accrue until possession shall have been 
given to her, in addition to P500 as moral, actual and consequential damages, 
P200 as attorney's fees and the costs.</p>
<p>Not having filed a responsive pleading, petitioners were declared in default 
on August 24, 1959. Respondent Judge then received the evidence for Rufina 
Subastil, and later on, rendered judgment, on or about October 27, 1959, finding 
that petitioners were, since 1950, tenants of Rufina Subastil under a 70-30 
sharing basis, representing five (5) cavanes of palay a year for her, which were 
paid by petitioners during the agricultural yaar 1950-1951, but not subsequently 
thereto, and sentencing petitioners to vacate the land and to pay P400.00, as 
well as the costs, to Rufina Subastil.</p>
<p>Petitioners moved for a reconsideration of said decision upon the ground: (a) 
that the Court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, the 
same being exclusively cognizable by the Court of Agrarian Relations; (b) that 
defendants' failure to file their answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or 
excusable negligence because, when the papers, presumably consisting of the 
summons and the complaint, were delivered to petitioner Luciano Valencia around 
May, 1959, he was bed-ridden, suffering great pains due to a fallen log that had 
rolled over his legs and broken the same—as attested to by a physician whose 
certificate was appended to said motion—because of which, he and his wife forgot 
all about said papers and were unable to answer the complaint; and (c) that 
petitioners have a good and valid defense in that they have proof—consisting of 
a document executed on August 11, 1892 in favor of their parents, as well as 
several tax declarations and tax receipts from 1949 to 1953—showing that the 
land in question is theirs.</p>
<p>This motion for reconsideration was denied, and, soon thereafter, respondent 
Judge issued an order directing the execution of said decision, whereupon 
petitioners instituted this action for certiorari upon the ground that the Court 
of First Instance of Camarines Sur had no jurisdiction over said case No. 4457, 
it appearing on the face of the complaint therein that its purpose was to eject 
the petitioners as tenants of an agricultural land and respondent Judge having, 
in his aforementioned decision, ordered the ejectment of petitioners herein as 
such tenants of an agricultural land, which is within the exclusive competence 
of the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>
<p>In their answer, respondents herein alleged, <i>inter alia</i>, that there 
could have been no tenancy relationship between petitioners herein and Rufina 
Subastil because petitioners asserted in their motion for reconsideration that 
the land in question belongs to them; that, assuming that said relationship had 
existed, non-compliance with the conditions thereof terminated said 
relationship; and that, in any event, Republic Act No. 1199, which took effect 
on August 30, 1954, is inapplicable to the parties in said Case No. 4457, their 
relationship as landlord and tenants having begun prior thereto.</p>
<p>Respondents' pretense is clearly untenable for Civil Case No. 4457 was begun 
on or about February 14, 1959, when Republic Act No. 1199 was already in force. 
The application of this statute to said case would, therefore, be prospective in 
nature, aside from the fact that it is already settled that laws enacted in the 
exercise of the police power, to which said Act belongs, may constitutionally 
affect tenancy relations created before the enactment or effectivity thereof 
(Viuda de Ongsiako <i>vs</i>. Gamboa, 86 Phil., 50; 47 Off. Gaz., [11] 
5613).</p>
<p>Again, respondent Judge having found that petitioners are tenants of an 
agricultural land, it is clear that their ejectment is beyond the jurisdiction 
of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur (Bakit <i>vs</i>. Asperin, 111 
Phil., 923), for pursuant to section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the landholder or by a 
third party and/or the settlement and disposition of disputes arising from the 
relationship of landholder and tenant, as well as the violation of any of the 
provisions of this Act, shall be under the original and exclusive jurisdiction 
of such court as may now or hereafter be authorized by law to take cognizance of 
tenancy relations and disputes."</p></blockquote>
<p>and Republic Act No. 1267, creating the Court of Agrarian Relations, 
provides, in section 7 thereof, as amended by Republic Act No. 1409, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over the entire 
Philippines, to consider, investigate, decide, and settle all questions, 
matters, controversies or disputes involving all those relationships established 
by law which determine the varying rights of persons in the cultivation and use 
of agricultural land where one of the parties works the land: <i>Provided, 
however,</i> That cases pending in the Court of Industrial Relations upon 
approval of this Act which are within the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations, shall be transferred to, and the proceedings therein continued in, 
the latter court."</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the decision complained of is hereby annulled, with costs against 
respondent Rufina Subastil. It is so ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, 
Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and 
<i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
