				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the order of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Court dismissing its Civil Case No. 01124, for want of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">After their complaint in Civil Case No. 33467 of the Court of
First Instance of Manila<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because the principal question involved
therein was the paternity of the late Dr. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>,
the minors Beatriz and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>, represented
by their mother, <span class="SpellE">Feliza</span> <span class="SpellE">Orijuela</span>,
commenced <span style="">a </span>proceeding, on
April 18, 1958, in the juvenile and Domestic Re­lations Court (<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Case No. 01124) against <span class="SpellE">Jacoba</span>
T. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> and Luis, Vicente, Tomas, Susana and Maria
Lucia, all surname <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>, the surviving widow and
legitimate children of the said de­ceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs minors alleged in their complaint, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><u>,</u> that they are two of the three children
of Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> (who died in­testate on April 17,
1956) begotten out of wedlock with <span class="SpellE">Feliza</span> <span class="SpellE">Ori<span style="">juela</span></span><span style="">, conceived and born at the time when the deceased was cohabiting with
the latter; that they were in continuous possession and enjoyment of the status
of children of the deceased, shown </span><span style="">by his direct and overt acts and those of his family; that on June 26,
1956, after the demise of Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>, the
defendants, in evi</span><span style="">dent bad faith and in fraud of plaintiffs, as compulsory heirs, executed
a deed of extrajudicial partition, dividing among themselves the estate of the
deceased consisting of real and personal properties; that on account of the
unlawful and malicious deprivation by defendants, of their rightful share in
the </span><span style="">decedent's <span style="">estate, plain­tiffs have incurred actual
expenses amounting to P20,000.00; and that, as illegitimate children of the
deceased Dr. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>, they </span></span><span style="">are entitled to support and maintenance for
their education and well-­being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was,
therefore, prayed the court that (1) their mother <span class="SpellE">Feliza</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orijuela</span> be appointed guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span><u>;</u> (2) they be declared illegitimate
(adulterous) children of the deceased Dr. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Pa­terno</span>;
(3) defendants be compelled to recognize them as compulsory heirs of the
deceased; (4) the "Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate" entered into
by the defendants be declared null and void; (5) their share and participation
in the estate be determined, and defendants be compelled to deliver the same to
them; (6) defendants be sentenced, jointly and severally, to pay them actual damages
in the sum of P2</span><span style="">0</span><span style="">,000.00, exemplary
damages for P10,000.00, and moral damages in such amount as the court may fix,
and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also asked for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, for
not less than P2,000.00 a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the records that upon defendants' filing their
answer, the Honorable N. <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span>-Lopez started
reception of plain­tiffs' evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, on January 11, 1964, prior to a scheduled continuation of the
hearing, the Honorable Judge C. <span class="SpellE">Juliano-Agrava</span>, who
was appointed to the Court, required the parties to show cause why the <span style="">case should not be
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On A</span><span style="">pril 4, 1964, and after both parties had
submitted their respective memoranda, the court finally ordered the dismissal
of the case, for the reason that where an illegitimate child </span><span style="">seeks </span><span style="">to participate in
the estate of the deceased putative father, the action becomes essentially one
for recovery of plaintiff's supposed share in the estate and the question of
paternity becomes merely an incident thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">As the main issue falls
within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, the incidental question of
paternity should also be resolved there, if the splitting of causes of action </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the order now subject of the present
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The parties are agreed that the issue of paternity is within the
competence of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court to entertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied either that cases falling
within the jurisdiction <span style="">of the said special court are specifically enumerated and claims for
participation in the estate of a deceased putative parent, and for damages are
not included therein.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it is also specifically provided in
Republic Act 1401, that should any Matter ordinarily cognizable by the Juvenile
and Domestic Re­lations Court arise as an incident in any case, in the ordinary
courts, such incidental matter </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">to be resolved in that main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue to be determined here, therefore,
is which of plaintiffs’ claims (<span class="SpellE">filiation</span> or
participation) constitutes the main cause and which is merely an incident
thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In declaring itself without jurisdiction to take cognizance of
the case, the trial court ruled that the main action here is that for
participation in the estate of the deceased, the issue of paternity becoming
merely an incident thereto; thus, all the issues should be passed upon by the
probate or the ordinary court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The inherent defect in this conclusion is that it practically
assumes that plaintiffs have a right to share in the estate of the sup<span style="">posed father. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hence, the giving of more weight and
importance to the claim against the estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that should not be so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be remembered that for an illegitimate child not natural to be entitled to
the <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights mentioned in Articles 287 and
887 of the Civil Code, there must be admission or recognition of his paternity.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in this case, there </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">no allegation in the appellants' complaint that they were voluntarily
acknowledged or recognized by the deceased as his illegitimate children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it was therein alleged that they
were in continuous possession of the status of illegitimate children of the
late Dr. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>, which </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a ground for compulsory recognition under Article 283 </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Civil </span><span style="">Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, plaintiffs prayed the court to compel
the defendants-legitimate heirs of the decedent to recognize their status as
illeg­itimate (adulterous) children of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, before the claim to participate in
the estate may be prosecuted, plaintiffs' right to succeed' must first be established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Differently stated, plaintiffs' main action
is that for recognition of their status as illegitimate children of the
deceased, upon which the right to share in the hereditary estate of the
putative father would rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, we cannot sustain appellants' contention that
the matters of partition of the estate of the deceased and their claim for
damages may be entertained by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, in the
exercise of "such incidental powers as are generally possessed by courts
of first instance." (Sec. 1, Rep. Act , 1401).</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be realized that the Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Court is a court of special jurisdiction, established as an exper­imental or
pilot-project in the City of Manila, to determine how a tribunal specializing
in cases and proceedings affecting children'' and domestic r<span style="">e</span>lations
can contribute in the drive to curb juvenile delinquency.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The intent of the lawmakers to confer on such court only limited jurisdiction
is indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, as originally
drafted?<span style="">paragraph (f) of Section
1 of the bill which became Republic Act 1401 reads, "actions involving the
conjugal partnership." It </span><span style="">was, </span><span style="">however, amended to read "actions for
the separation of property of the spouses", precisely so as not to deprive
the regular courts </span><span style="">of jurisdiction over testate proceedings.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">The discussion in Congress on this </span><span style="">point </span><span style="">is enlightening --<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"MR. ENVERGA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have in
mind that this matter also refers to the estate of the decedent, because the
terminology is too general, conjugal partnership, and whenever there is
conjugal partnership property involved, it is my belief that, according to this
bill, the case should be presented in the juvenile delinquency court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"MR. FRANCISCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
grateful to the gentleman from <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> for his
question, because it would clarify the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose is not to include settlement of <span style="">the estate of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are clarifying this for purposes of
interpretation later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why I am
grate­ful to the gentleman for his question, because I believe that the purpose
of the Committee and the spirit of the bill is to give jurisdiction to this
court over questions affecting conjugal partnership between husbands and wives
who are alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would not affect the
settle­ment of the estate of deceased persons."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In granting to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court
"such incidental powers generally possessed by the court of first
instance", the law, therefore, could not have intended to confer on this
special tribunal jurisdiction over all, subject matter cognizable by the
ordinary <span style="">court
of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term
"incidental powers" must refer to - the authority to issue such
orders or writs and take such measures as might be necessary to carry out the
functions of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The above conclusion will, not constitute a violation of the rule
against splitting of cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prohibition provided in the <span style="">Rules of Court is against the institution of more
than one suit for a single cause</span><span style=""> of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">(</span><span style="">S</span><span style="">ec.
3; </span><span style="">Rule
2, Revised Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">But, as alleged in the </span><span style="">complaint, the
bases for plaintiffs' various claims would not be the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the creation of the Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Court, with its exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving paternity
and acknowledgment, recognition of children and recovery of hereditary shares
can no longer be properly joined as causes of action, since each lies within
the jurisdiction of a different tribunal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from, insofar <span style="">as </span>it affects the issue of paternity,
is hereby set aside, and the case is returned to the Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Court for determination of that particular issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the defen­dants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
