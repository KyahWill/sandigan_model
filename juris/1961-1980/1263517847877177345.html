<p class="BODY">For a more logical discussion, these assigned errors will be
taken up in a different order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The position of
appellants under the second assignment of error </span>is <span style="">that the appointments of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
here involved are not permanent but conditional, for the reason </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">they were all approved </span>by <span style="">the
Commissioner of Civil Service "subject to the availability of </span><span style="">funds".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find </span><span style="">no merit in this
claim. <span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> </span><span style="">having served the government </span><span style="">already for a long period of time under their respective appointments,
the condition adverted to cannot </span><span style="">now
</span><span style="">affect-the nature of said
appointments which, as found by the trial court upon the evidence, are
permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, viewed as a condition
precedent, the clause or proviso "subject to the availability of
funds" has long ceased to have any significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it effective as a condition
subsequent attached to the appointments in this case every appointment to a
position in the civil service presup</span><span style="">poses the existence </span><span style="">of a
corresponding item or fund in the budget - </span><span style="">be it </span><span style="">national,
provincial, city or municipal </span><span style="">-from
which the salary of the appointee is to be drawn; and considering that at the
time the services of herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were
terminated, the fiscal </span><span style="">year in
which their appointments were extended had not ended, it may not be validly
argued that the funds for their positions were then no longer available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it may </span><span style="">be stated by </span><span style="">way of </span><span style="">a general
proposition that all appointments in the civil service may be deemed subject to
such condition </span><span style="">subsequent; and
to follow herein </span><span style="">appellants'
line of reasoning would make all appointments in the </span><span style="">civil </span><span style="">service conditional forever, never to acquire the status of permanence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with appellants,
of course, in </span><span style="">their conten­tion </span><span style="">under the third assignment of error, that
there should be a distinction between removal from an office, on the one hand,
and abolition of the office itself, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A removal implies that the office from which
an employee had been ousted before the </span><span style="">expiration of his term </span><span style="">subsists
</span><span style="">after the ouster, unlike in the
case of abolition </span><span style="">of an office
which necessarily extinguishes the </span><span style="">right
</span><span style="">thereto of its incumbent by
reason of the consequent non­existence of the office that had been
abolished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, the
constitutional </span><span style="">mandate to the
effect </span><span style="">that "no officer or </span><span style="">employee in the civil service shall be re­moved
</span><span style="">or suspended except for cause as
provided by law" is not in point, for there is neither removal nor
suspension of the incumbent but an abolition of his former office.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Be that as it may, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are constrained to hold, under the circumstances of this case, that the ouster
of herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, while appearing to have been
occasioned by the abolition of their posts, in reality constitutes removal </span><span style="">from office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The power to abolish an office is not absolute; </span><span style="">it is subject to the limitation that the same
be exercised in good faith in order to be valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"As well settled as the <span style="">rule </span>that the abolition of an office does

be made in good faith.</span> Where the <span style="">abolition
is </span>made in bad faith, for political or personal reasons, or in order to
circumvent the constitutional security of tenure of civil service employees, it

<p class="BODY">This brings us to herein appellants' fourth assigned error that
the lower court erred in considering that the <span style="">abolition of </span><span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' positions was
done in bad faith. We really cannot see our way clear to why the appellant city
officials concerned, barely three (3) days <span style="">after </span><span style="">assumption </span><span style="">in office, </span>should require such minor employees of the city as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, to tender their "courtesy <span style="">resigna</span>tions" for the alleged
purpose of giving the new <span style="">adminis</span>tration
"a free hand".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And apropos to
this <span style="">inquiry is the </span>seeming
persistence with which <span style="">said appellants
required <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> </span>to resign their positions,
it appearing that the <span style="">same </span>subject
matter was subsequently brought out <span style="">again
in </span>a conference between them, and then followed with a letter-reminder
of the former city treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
satisfied that these circumstances, coupled with the finding of <span style="">the </span>court below that soon after the
abolition of the <span style="">positions in </span>question
"the Municipal Board created <span style="">various
new posi­tions in </span>the City Government and appropriated <span style="">several thousand </span>pesos for
improvements and <span style="">salaries </span>of <span style="">officials </span>and employees," do not
bespeak of good faith on the part of appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants ask under the first assignment of error the following
question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ozamiz</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> be compelled by </span><i>mandamus</i> to
recreate positions which <span style="">it had abolished?
</span>They take the negative side of the <span style="">question </span><span style="">and come up with </span>the following argument:</p>

<blockquote>"It is very clear that the <span style="">proceeding </span>for <i>mandamus</i> applies only to <span style="">compel </span>performance of a <span style="">ministerial act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty must be </span>clear and
specific.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>does not apply to control or <span style="">review nor mal exercise </span>of judgment or
<span style="">discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case </span>the act of creating <span style="">positions or abolishin</span>g<span style=""> </span>them which <span style="">it has </span>created involves the exercise <span style="">of </span><span style="">power and
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And to recreate a
position already abolished also requires <span style="">sound discretion </span>to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:place></st1:city>
cannot be compiled to restore the petitioners’ <span style="">item in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">budget."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above argument, while quite logical is off <span style="">tangent in </span>this <span style="">case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>It is not applicable <span style="">here
where, as <span class="GramE">We</span> have earlier intimated, </span>the
attempted <span style="">abolition of the offices </span>of
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellees</span></span><span style=""> </span>by appellants, <span style="">is </span><span style="">null, void and
without </span>legal effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In legal <span style="">contemplation then, the said </span>offices
still exist, and <i>mandamus</i> <span style="">is a
proper remedy </span>to compel herein appellants not <span style="">only to make the necessary appropriations </span>needed for the <span style="">reimbursement of the </span>salaries of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellees</span></span><span style=""> </span>who have in the <span style="">meanwhile </span>found other employment
corresponding to the <span style="">period from their </span>dismissal
to the date of such new employment <span style="">but
also </span>to reinstate one of said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span style="">who had not been reemployed since </span>his
separation from the service.</p>

<blockquote>"We, therefore, declare, and so hold, that the abolition of
the positions of the petitioners <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>pursuant to resolution

</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style="">, </span>is
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the respondents
have unlawfully excluded the petitioners from the enjoyment <span style="">of </span>a right or office to which they are
entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We finally hold that in
failing to include item or items in the 1964-1965 annual budget for the
province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, and/or refusing to approve a
supplemental budget for the fiscal year 1964-1965 including item or items, to
cover appropriations for the salaries of the petitioners, the respondents have
unlawfully failed or neglected the performance of an act which the law enjoins
as a duty resulting from office.</blockquote>

foregoing, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> prayed for by the petitioners should be,
as it is hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents, as members of the provincial board of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
are commanded to appropriate, without unnecessary delay, the amounts necessary
for the salaries of petitioners, as stated in this decision, for the fiscal
year 1964-1965 and for the fiscal years thereafter, x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> together with such amounts as </span>may be

in a number of cases </span><span style="">that
municipal corporations may <span style="">be held
liable </span>for the </span><u>back pay or wages</u> <span style="">of <span style="">employees or laborers
illegally separated from the service, including those in­volving primarily
