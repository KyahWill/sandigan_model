				<H3>ELEUTERIO CANEDA, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. GREGORIO S. NARVASA, AND/OR THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE FIFTH BRANCH AND/OR COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF CEBU, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF BOHOL, PHILIPPINE-AMERICAN GENERAL INSURANCE CO., INC., CELERINO DELGADO AND PEDRO LABRA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by certiorari filed by the petitioner against an order of 
the respondent Court dismissing a petition filed by the herein petitioner in 
CA-G. R. No. 28667-R, Eleuterio Caneda vs. Hon. Gregorio S. Narvasa, et al., on 
the ground of lack of merits. In the petition Caneda alleged as a first cause of 
action that in Civil Case No. 25376 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
filed by Philamgen against him (Eleuterio Caneda) and Celerino Delgado, judgment 
was rendered sentencing the defendants to pay to plaintiff P2,986.50, 
notwithstanding the fact that no summons was served upon petitioner Eleuterio 
Caneda, but that a certain lawyer representing himself to be petitioner's 
attorney signed the summons for him (defendant); as a second cause of action, 
that in Civil Case No. 26428, also of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
Philamgen as plaintiff and the herein petitioner Eleuterio Caneda, Celerino 
Delgado and Pedro Labra as defendants, the latter were sentenced to pay the sum 
of P4,597.50 in spite of the fact that Eleuterio Caneda was again not served 
summons, said summons having been received in petitioner's behalf by his 
co-defendant Celerino Delgado; and as third cause of action, that in Civil Case 
No. 26429, also of the Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled Philamgen vs. 
Eleuterio Caneda and Celerino Delgado, judgment was rendered against said 
defendants including petitioner, sentencing them to pay P3,000.00 notwitstanding 
the fact that no summons was served upon the petitioner herein, the summons 
having been received for him by his co-defendant Celerino Delgado. It is further 
alleged as a cause for complaint that in the first suit, Civil Case No. 25376 of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila, one Rosa V. Pangilinan, with office 
and/or residence at Enad Building, Juan Luna St., Cebu City, represented himself 
as counsel for petitioner in violation of the Rules, petitioner herein not 
having a residence or place of business at Enad Building, Juan Luna St., Cebu 
City; that in the second and third actions, hearing proceeded without summons 
having been served upon petitioner herein; that in none of the above actions has 
the petitioner ever engaged the services of Celerino Delgado, or authorized him 
to receive summons for him, or to appear for him as counsel; that the petitioner 
has been deprived of his day in court, respondent Philamgen having without his 
knowledge and with malice and bad faith filed and/or proceeded with the 
proceedings and/or delayed application for issuance of writ of execution of the 
judgments rendered, etc.; that respondent Philamgen in the civil cases above 
mentioned pretended good faith in accepting forged signatures of the herein 
petitioner as genuine, etc.; and that the petitioner has no other plain, speedy 
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the decisions in said civil 
cases having become final by lapse of time and the same are pending execution. 
The prayer asked for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction 
restraining the respondent judge, the sheriffs of Cebu and Bohol, and their 
agents or representatives, from executing the judgments rendered in said civil 
cases; and after trial to declare the decisions or the judgments in the above 
entitled cases null and void, as entered without jurisdiction and thereafter 
declare the preliminary injunction issued as permanent.
<p>The resolution of the Court of Appeals dismissing the petition reads 
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Acting upon the verified petition filed by counsel for petitioner in case 
CA-G. R. No. 28667-R, Eleuterio Caneda vs. Hon. Gregorio S. Narvasa, et al., 
praying, on the grounds therein stated, that upon petitioner's filing of a bond 
fixed by the Court, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued enjoining the 
respondents, Hon. Gregorio S. Narvasa or any presiding judge of the Fifth Branch 
of the Court of First Instance of Manila, the Provincial Sheriff of Cebu and the 
Provincial SherifF of Bohol or any of their duly authorized representatives from 
enforcing the decision and writs of execution issued in Civil Cases No. 25376, 
Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc., vs. Celerino Delgado, et al., 
No. 26428, Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Celerino Delgado, 
et al., and No. 26429, Philippine-American General Insurance Co., Inc. vs. 
Celerino Delgado et al., of the Court of First Instance of Manila; and after 
hearing, the decisions rendered by the respondent Judge in the above-entitled 
civil cases insofar as it affects the petitioner be annulled and be declared 
null and void and the aforesaid cases against him be dismissed; and considering 
the allegation in the petition itself that the decisions in the afore-entitled 
civil cases have already become final and hence can no longer be appealed, for 
which reason the remedy sought herein is not in aid of the Court's appellate 
jurisdiction; and considering further that the question of whether or not the 
respondent court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner in the 
aforementioned civil cases is one of fact requiring presentation of evidence, 
which can only be done in the appropriate civil action; the Court RESOLVED to 
DENY the petition for lack of merits, and consequently to DISMISS the case, as 
the same hereby is DISMISSED without pronouncement as to 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>We find merit in the petition. Section 30 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 
defines the pertinent jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 30. <i>Original jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals</i>.â€”The Court of 
Appeals shall have original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, 
prohibition, injunction, certiorari, habeas corpus, and all other auxiliary 
writs and process in aid of its appellate jurisdiction."</p></blockquote>
<p>The authority of the Court of Appeals to issue writs of mandamus, 
prohibition, injunction, certiorari and habeas corpus in aid of its appellate 
jurisdiction has been held to be based on the existence of a right to appeal to 
it from the judgment on the merits. Tuason &amp; Co., etc. vs. CA., G. R. No. 
L-18128, December 26, 1961; Republic vs. Tuason, et al, G. R. No. L-18672, 
December 26, 1961; Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., etc., vs. Sanvictores, G. R. No. 
L-16836, January 30, 1962.) For the Court of Appeals to have jurisdiction in 
said special civil cases it is not necessary that a party has actually appealed 
or will take an appeal against decisions or resolutions of the Court of First 
Instance; it is enough if it appears from the plaintiff's petition that the 
petitioner has a right to appeal according to law from the order or decision of 
the Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeals. (Breslin, et al. vs. Luzon 
Stevedoring Co., et al., CA-G. R. No. 3121-R, Sept. 29, 1949; Valero vs. Ysip, 
et al., CA-G. R. No. 4896-R, June 30, 1950.)</p>
<p>There is no doubt in the case at bar that had petitioner been notified of the 
proceedings taken against him in the manner provided by the Rules, he could have 
brought timely appeal against the judgments subject of his petition for 
annulment, it appearing that the amounts involved in the actions fall within the 
appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. In the case of Salva vs. 
Palacio, et al., 90 Phil., 731; 53 Off. Gaz. (10) 3089, this Court in denying a 
petition filed before it, held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This petition should have been filed in the Court of Appeals because it is a 
special civil remedy in aid of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of 
Appeals. Had the record on appeal been allowed it would have come under the 
appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Court of Appeals has what may be known as a supervisory power over the 
courts of first instance, because ordinarily decisions or orders of these lower 
courts are appealable thereto. The case at bar is an example where the 
supervisory power should be exercised by the Court of Appeals to correct 
apparent errors affecting the validity of the proceedings before the lower 
court. It is not, as stated in the resolution of the Court of Appeals appealed 
from, the fact that evidence would be taken that determines whether or not the 
Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain the petition for injunction. Were 
we to follow the ruling enunciated in the order appealed from, petitioner here 
would never have any remedy at all. Besides, the certified copies of the 
summonses and the service thereof to petitioner herein in the three cases 
subject of his petition for annulment are enough to prove the validity of his 
assertions that there was no service of summons upon him or that it had been 
irregular. Copies of the summonses have been furnished to this Court in the 
record and we are satisfied that the claim of petitioner stated in his petition, 
that he has not been summoned in accordance with the rules, is well-founded.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, the petition is hereby granted, the 
decisions or judgments rendered against the petitioner are hereby declared null 
and void in so far as they affect the petitioner, and the preliminary injunction 
issued upon the filing of the petition is hereby made permanent. With costs 
against respondents Philippine-American General Insurance Co., Inc., Celerino 
Delgado and Pedro Labra. So ordered.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> 
and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur. </div>
