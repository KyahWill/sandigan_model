administrator of the estate of his deceased father, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaseñor</span>, filed a 
petition in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> 
Occidental (Civil Case No. 5662) to enjoin the Register of Deeds of the same 
province from registering a deed of sale by which the deceased conveyed to Jose 
Ma. <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> two lots registered in his name, to wit, 
<span class="SpellE">Lofs</span> No&amp; 2532-C and 2533-B of the Cadastral Survey 
of <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental. 
The reason given for seeking injunctive relief was that the deed of sale was 
fictitious and that the signature of the vendor was forged. The court issued a 
writ of preliminary injunction to maintain the <u>status quo</u>. The vendee, 
<span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>, who had not been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as a party-defendant, intervened in the case. On 
<st1:date month="10" day="3" year="1960">October 3, 1960</st1:date> the court 
lifted the writ of preliminary injunction and dismissed the petition.
<p>Two days later, on October 5, <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> filed his own 
petition in the cadastral record of said lots, asking that the Register of Deeds 
be ordered to register the aforementioned deed of sale. The ground alleged in 
the petition was that Civil Case No. 5662 had been dismissed and the preliminary 
injunction issued therein had been dissolved. On the same day the court, without 
notice either to the Register of Deeds or to appellant, and solely on the basis 
of the allegations in the petition, issued the corresponding order for 
registration. In compliance therewith the Register of Deeds cancelled the two 
certificates of title in the name of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaseñor</span> and issued new 
ones in <span class="SpellE">Ledesma's</span> name. On <st1:date month="10" day="8" year="1960">October 8, 1960</st1:date>, again upon <span class="SpellE">Ledesma's</span> petition, the court ordered the cancellation of 
the certificates thus issued and the issuance of still new ones, also in his 
name.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Villaseñor</span> moved for reconsideration of the two 
orders and then perfected this appeal upon their denial.</p>
<p>Appellant claims that the lower court erred in issuing the orders appealed 
from because: (1) <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> failed to give notice to 
appellant or to furnish him copy of the petition; (2) <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should have filed the same in Civil Case No. 5662 
and not in the cadastral proceeding; (3) the court had no power to order the 
Register of Deeds to register the deed of sale in question when the same was 
being contested as fictitious, nor to order the issuance of titles in the name 
of the supposed buyer; <span class="GramE">and</span> (4) if, as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> points out, the Register of Deeds had improperly 
refused to register the deed of sale, the proper remedy should have been a suit 
for mandamus.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the lower court did commit the error attributed to 
it. To be sure, when the writ of preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. 5662 
was dissolved in the same order which dismissed appellant's petition the 
obstacle to the registration of the deed of sale was removed. The effect of the 
dissolution was immediate and would not be stayed even if an appeal had been 
perfected from the order of dismissal (Watson vs. Enriquez, 1 Phil. 480; <span class="SpellE">Sitia</span> <span class="SpellE">Teco</span> vs. 
<st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>, 1 Phil. 497). But that is 
only as far as the Register of Deeds was concerned, his duty under the 
circumstances—if the document was on its face <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>—being administrative and ministerial. The 
lifting of the injunction, however, or even the dismissal of the petition, was 
no authority for the court in the cadastral proceeding to issue the orders 
complained of without notice to the Register of Deeds or to appellant, 
considering that the dismissal of Civil Case No. 3662 was not yet final. The 
court knew of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of that case and of the 
fact that the relief sought therein by appellant was precisely to prevent 
registration. Irrespective of the propriety or impropriety of the remedy 
pursued, that is, whether or not mandamus should have been resorted to, the 
least that the court <u>a quo</u> should have done was to afford appellant 
proper notice and hearing, so that he could reiterate his objections to the 
registration and present evidence to substantiate them and/or call the court's 
attention to the fact that the question had not yet been definitely settled in 
the civil action since the order dismissing it was not yet final.</p>
<p>It is one thing for the Register of Deeds, in the exercise of his ministerial 
duties under the law, to register an instrument which in his opinion is <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>, and quite another thing for the court itself to 
order the registration. The former does not contemplate notice to and <span class="GramE">hearing of interested parties such as are</span> required in a 
judicial proceeding nor carry with it the solemnity and legal consequences of a 
court judgment. The court <u>a quo</u>, in anticipating the action of the 
Register of Deeds, unnecessarily took the matter out of his hands and at the 
same time preempted the question of registration still pending in the civil 
action filed by appellant.</p>
<p>The orders appealed from are hereby set aside with cost against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>
