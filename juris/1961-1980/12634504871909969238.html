decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
(in its Civil Case No. 1318).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants, who are the four children of the late <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> by his first
marriage with Cornelia <span class="SpellE">Bucayan</span> (also <span class="GramE">deceased)</span> have instituted this action for partition in the
Court below against the four (4) <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, children of the second marriage of <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span>, and against his surviving widow, <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tandog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs sought partition of several
unregistered parcels of land in <span class="SpellE">Taganaan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, and of a cash deposit of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
in the Philippine National Bank, <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> Branch,
standing in the name of <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants
pleaded in answer that the properties in question originated from a death
benefit payment made by the U. S. Veterans Administration to <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> and his second
wife <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tandog</span>, on
account of the death of their son Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>, a
full-blood brother of defendants, who was a USAFFE soldier killed in action
during World War II; that said Leonardo died unmarried but survived by his
parents and by a natural daughter, <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants claimed that the only heirs to the
properties sought to be partitioned were the soldier Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat's</span> surviving mother and his daughter <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span>, herein <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial the parties agreed upon the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rec. on Appeal, pp. 14-15) ?</p>

<blockquote>"1. That a certain <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>, the <span class="SpellE">inter­venor</span>, was born
to Carmen <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> with the now deceased Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> as her father, but Carmen <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span>
and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> were never legally married <span class="SpellE">altho</span> they were in a capacity to marry at the time that <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> was <span class="GramE">conceived</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. That Carmen <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> also filed a claim
with the US Veterans Administration for the death be­nefit of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> for the amount of P16<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
but this amount was not granted to her but to the now deceased <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> and the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tandog</span>,
because Carmen <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> could not show proof of having
been le­gally married to Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. That the parcel of land that were purchased with the money
received from the US Veterans Administration as death benefits of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> are parcels 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 under paragraph three
of the amended complaint; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. That the amount of P4,000.00 mentioned in paragraph 3 of the
complaint is also a part of the P16,000.00 received by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tandog</span> which has been
deposited with the Philippine National Bank, in <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>
City."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the trial Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buslon</span>, further found from the evidence that <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> "enjoyed
the status of a recognized natural child from the time she was born until the
present time" (Decision, R. App., p. 16); and on the basis of Article 991
of the new Civil Code, decided that the only parties entitled to share in the
property were the mother, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tandog</span> and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>, to the exclusion of the appellants, issue of <span class="SpellE">Escolastico's</span> first marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with appellants that the appealed decision can not stand
as it is in error on at least four counts.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, the Court below erred in applying the new Civil Code to
the succession of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span> who died in 1945,
or even before, (the exact date being uncertain) under the regime of the Code
of 1889 (Civil Code of the Phil., Art. 2263).</p>

<p class="BODY">Next, it erred in declaring the natural daughter, <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>, entitled to
succeed her late natural father, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>,
solely on the basis of her enjoyment of the status of a natural child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an elementary and basic principle in
our law of succession that the rights of a natural child spring not from the <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> itself but from the child's acknowledgment by the
natural parent, made voluntarily or by court decree.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Equally basic and elementary but also ignored by the trial Court, is the fact
that possession or enjoyment of the status of natural child is <u>per</u> <u>se</u>
not a sufficient operative acknowledgment but only a ground to compel the
parent to acknowledge the child (<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Code of 1889,
Art. 135; new Civil Code, Art. 283).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record of appeal before us nowhere shows, or even suggests, that <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> was
voluntarily or compulsorily acknowledged in the manner prescribed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it show that, because her
natural father died during her minority, she has instituted a timely action to
compel her acknowledgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the case
stands now, there is no way to declare her possessed of hereditary rights in
the estate of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether she may still bring an action to
compel acknowledgment, we can not decide now, for lack of adequate data.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third, the trial Court erred in considering the death benefit
payment by the U. S. Veterans Administration as part of the estate of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This money
was paid to his parents by the United States Government by way of indemnity or
insurance for the death of the soldier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter was never entitled to it himself, since he died before the
payment accrued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The money paid was
there­fore exclusive property of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat's</span>
parents, <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tandog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering it community property, <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> was entitled to one half thereof, and, hence,
of the property acquired thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
his death in 1959 without leaving any testament, that half descended unto all
his eight (8) surviving children of the first and second marriages, with the
surviving widow being also entitled to a share equal to that of each of the
children (Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Art. 996):</p>

<p class="BODY">"ART. 996. -- If a widow or widower and legitimate children
or descendants are left, the surviving spouse has in the succession the same
share as that of each of the children."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the fourth place, the assumption in the appealed decision that
Article 991 of the new Civil Code applies, is erroneous, in view of the facts
previously adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if it
did apply, the death benefit payment should belong, in equal shares, to the
natural child and the parents of the soldier Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>;
and the half of the parents can not belong to the mother alone, for she was not
the only surviving parent of the predeceased Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In excluding the father, <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span>,
the lower Court acted contrary to all logic and common sense.</p>

<p class="BODY">After all is said, the basic fact is that the estate to be
settled is that of <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>,
and not that of his predeceased son, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Alabat</span>,
as mistakenly assumed by the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the plaintiffs-appellants being children
of <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> are clearly entitled to share in the
properties described in their complaint and to maintain this suit for
partition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether the natural child, <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span>,
can succeed to the share of her father, Leonardo, by right of representation, depends
upon whether she has been properly acknowledged as his natural child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that this point was apparently
not litigated, and taking into account that if Leonardo died during his
daughter's minority, the latter had four (4) years after attaining majority, to
file an action to compel acknowledgment,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
both equity and justice demand that <span class="SpellE">Wenifreda</span> be
given ample opportunity to establish in the Court below whatever rights she is
entitled to in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from is
reversed and set aside, and the case is ordered remanded to the Court of origin
for further proceedings conformably to this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</span></p>
