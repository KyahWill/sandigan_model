VS. HON. MINERVA I. PIGUING, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF PAMPANGA, THE MUNICIPALITY OF SAN FERNANDO, THE CITY OF
ANGELES, THE MUNICIPALITY OF GUAGUA, AND THE MUNICIPALITY OF MACABEBE, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
with preliminary injunction to annul two (2) orders of Honorable Minerva I. <span class="SpellE">Piguing</span>, as Judge of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
one dated December 29, 1965, and another January 14, 1966, and to restrain,
meanwhile, the enforcement of said orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner herein is the National Waterworks and Sewerage
Authority, hereinafter referred to as NAWASA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondents are said Judge <span class="SpellE">Piguing</span>, and
the Municipalities of San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Guagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, as well as the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>,
hereinafter referred to collectively as the municipal corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that, purporting to act in
pursuance of Republic Act No. 1383, during the year 1958, NAWASA took over the
possession, operation and control of the waterworks systems of said municipal
corporations, without paying any compensation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1961</st1:date>, said municipal corporations commenced
civil case No. 2026 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
against NAWASA to recover their respective waterworks systems, as well as
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their complaint, the
municipal corporations prayed, also, for a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction, to restrain NAWASA from enforcing said Republic Act No. 1383, during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the filing of <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span> answer -
admitting some alle­gations of the complaint, denying other allegations thereof
and setting up special defenses and a counterclaim - and the submission of the
reply thereto of the municipal corporations, said Court, - then presided over
by Hon. <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasicolan</span>,
Judge - held on March 16, 1963, a pre-trial, at which it was agreed between the
parties:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the only issue for
determination in the case was the fair and reasonable value of the properties
involved; (2) that the parties would submit a complete inventory thereof; (3)
that the same would be set for hearing, to determine the correctness thereof;
(4) that, after the approval of said inventory, the Court would appoint a
committee of appraisal; and (5) that, after the value of the aforementioned
properties had been settled, such other issues as the parties may raise shall
be heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, inventories were filed and an appraisal com­mittee
was organized, which, subsequently, submitted its report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="12">December
 11, 1965</st1:date>, the prayer of the municipal corporations for a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction was heard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1965</st1:date>,
said Court - then presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Piguing</span> -
issued one of the orders complained of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Premised upon the finding that "the continuous exercise" by
NAWASA "of its jurisdiction, supervision and control over the <span class="SpellE">waterwork</span> systems without paying just compensation to the x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> municipal corporations,
would be detrimental to their rights of dominion over their respective
waterworks system x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
", and that the Supreme Court had, in several cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
declared Republic Act 1383 "unconstitutional, as it carries out a transfer
of dominion" which is "in the nature of expropriation of private
property," said order of December 29, 1965 concluded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“IN VIEW THEREOF, this Court finds the petition for a mandatory
preliminary injunction meritorious pending the final determination of this
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, let a writ of
mandatory preliminary injunction be issued, enjoining and restraining the defendant
NAWASA from its administration, supervision, operation and control of the
waterworks system of the municipalities of <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Guagua</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, Angeles
(now City of <st1:city><st1:place>Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>) until further
order of this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1966</st1:date>,
NAWASA filed a motion for reconsideration, which was resolved by an order dated
<st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order states that, "taking into
consideration" the assurance given by counsel for the NAWASA to the effect
that, "given seventy-two (72) hours or three (3) days," the NAWASA
would be "able to x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
deposit x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the amount
corresponding to the net book value of the waterworks systems" in
question, to wit:</p>

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasicolan</span>" and as
recommended by the appraisal committee, the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory
Injunction issued on December 29, 1965, was suspended for seventy-two (72)
hours, beginning from January 14, 1966, "to give a chance to the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> NAWASA to make the
corresponding deposit" of said amounts, with the understanding that
otherwise, said writ "shall stand and be duly implemented," as well
as reiterated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, or on January 26, 1966, NAWASA commenced the present
action for <i style="">certiorari</i> with
preliminary injunction, alleging that respondent Judge had acted "with
grave abuse of discretion or without or in excess of jurisdiction" in
issuing said orders of December 29, 1965 and January 14, 1966, because NAWASA
had always been agreeable to pay the amounts claimed by the municipal
corporations in their original complaint and inventories; because, instead of
maintaining the <u>status quo</u>, the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction
issued by respondent Judge had changed or upset conditions that had been in
existence for over four (4) years; because, being a possessor in good faith,
NAWASA could not be deprived of its possession without payment of the improve­ments
it had introduced in the waterworks systems aforementioned; and because the
imposition upon NAWASA of the obligation to de­posit the sums set forth in the
order of January 14, 1966, was unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the posting and approval of a bond in the sum of P50, 000, we
issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for by NAWASA. </p>

<p class="BODY">The petition herein is manifestly devoid of merit for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the proprietary rights of the municipal
corporations to the waterworks systems in question are admitted; (2) so is
their right to compensation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and petitioner's
obligation to pay said compensation; (3) it is not disputed that petitioner had
taken said properties without making the requisite payment; (4) as early as
August 31, 1959, we had declared<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that Republic Act No. 1383 - on which petitioner relies - is unconstitutional,
a insofar as it authorizes the taking of local waterworks systems without
providing for an effective payment of just compensation<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
so that petitioner must have been aware of this fact over two (2) years <u>before</u>
the institution of the main case in the lower court; (5) the amounts set forth
in the order of January 14, 1966, are admittedly the book value of the properties
in question; and (6) petitioner's counsel had expressed its readiness and
willingness to make the deposit complained of, within the period specified in
said order.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In short</span>, we find
that respondent Judge had neither com­mitted a grave abuse of discretion nor
exceeded her jurisdiction in issuing the orders complained of, for which
reason, this case is hereby dismissed, and the writ of preliminary injunction
issued by this Court dissolved, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
