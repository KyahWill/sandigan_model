<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the plaintiffs seek (1) the annul­ment, on
the ground of fraud, of the extra-judicial foreclo­sure sale of not only the
thirteen "M-A-N" trucks of the ap­pellant company but also the
certificate of public convenience granted to the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daplas</span> by the Public Service Commission, and (2)
recovery of damages incurred by reason of the said allegedly vitiated sale in
the amount of P100,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint
especially places in focus the invalidity of the extra-judicial sale of the
public service franchise, averring that this franchise is not part of or
involved in the chattel mortgage that was executed by the plaintiffs in favor
of the defendants, and that the foreclosure was conducted without the requisite
prior notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of course beyond dispute that the Public Service Commission
is authorized by law to pass upon the question of whether or not the transferee
in a sale or assignment of a public service franchise is qualified to serve the
public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is rather
obvious that the questions tendered to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for
determination under the allegations of the complaint, namely, the validity of
the auction sale, especially and particularly in reference to the certificate
of public convenience, the due execution and genuineness of the instrument
covering the sale, and fraud in connection there­with, properly belong to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
