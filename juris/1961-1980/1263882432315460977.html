for re-admission to the practice of law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was first admitted to the practice
of law in 1971 after passing the Bar Examinations in 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, ordered the cancellation
of his name <span style="">in </span>the Roll of
Attorneys when the cancellation of his alien certificate of registration was
disallowed by the Department of Justice in 1973.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the petition and the documentary evidence
submitted that petitioner was born in <st1:place><st1:city>Manila</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1947" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1947</st1:date>, the
legitimate son of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Quilala</span>, an American citizen, and Julia Ramos, Filipino, as
shown in the certified copy of the birth certificate of petitioner issued by
the Civil Registrar of Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
His father is a native born Filipino who had gone to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> where he was drafted into the United
States Army and consequently acquired <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
citizenship by naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was

Liberation Forces that landed in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
and there met and married petitioner's mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner grew up and was raised in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and upon reaching the age of 23 years, he elected Philippine citizenship<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

which oath and affi­davit of election were registered with the Office of the

Petitioner took up Law at San <span class="SpellE">Beda</span> College, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and was admitted to take the 1970 Bar Examinations on condition that he will
submit proof of cancellation of his alien certificate of registration with the
Bureau of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He passed the
1970 bar examinations suc­cessfully with a rating of 77%.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1971</st1:date>,
the Commissioner of Immigration, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> M. Reyes,
issued an order granting the peti­tioner's petition to cancel his alien
registry, <span class="SpellE">ACR</span> No. B-190085 and <span class="SpellE">NBCR</span>
No. 167123, both issued in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1971" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1971</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1971</st1:date>, respectively.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, petitioner was allowed and he took his oath <span style="">as </span>member of the Philippine Bar on
March 8, 1971 and signed his name in the Roll of Attorneys.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 9, 1973, the Undersecretary of Justice ruled against
the order of the Commissioner of Immigration on the ground that "the only
evidence presented to prove that his mother was a Filipino citizen prior to her
mar­riage is the petitioner's birth certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the baptismal certificate and
marriage contract of the petitioner's mother, said documents are inadmissible
in evidence being merely <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies which have not
been duly verified from the originals thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, on October 17, 1975, the Clerk of Court of this Court
informed the petitioner that his office was in receipt of a letter dated
October 2, 1975 from the American Consul, United States Embassy, Manila,
inquiring as to whether or not the disallowance of petitioner's election of
Philippine citizenship by the Undersecretary of Justice would affect the
validity of his oath of office as member of the Philippine Bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In reply, petitioner wrote a letter<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
on January 8, 1976 to the Clerk of Court informing him that petitioner was not <span style="">disturbing the denial by the Department of
Justice of his election of Philippine citizenship in view of the ruling of the
United States Department of State contained in the letter of the American
consul to him dated December 10, 1975 which ruling states that if petitioner's
election of </span><span style="">Philippine <span style="">citizenship was granted, petitioner </span>would
be <span style="">divested of his U.S. citizenship.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court, having been
informed </span>that petitioner has decided not to disturb the denial by the
Department of Justice of <span style="">his election
of Philippine citizenship, </span>ordered the cancellation of petitioner's name
in the roll of attorneys <span style="">in its </span>Resolution
dated February 6, 1976.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also shown that <span style="">petitioner
</span>left for the United States and after <span style="">a year of </span>stay therein, he came back to the <span style="">Philippines realizing, </span>according to
him, that "his roots, upbringing, education and professional training are
completely and typically Filipino, the totality of which constitutes the very
being, existence and survival of petitioner which can never find a home in any
other place but the Philippines and besides, the primary evidence needed to
move for reconsideration of the denial of petitioner's <span style="">citizenship </span>election are already available for submission to the
Department of Justice."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, petitioner moved for reconsideration of the order of
the <span style="">Undersecretary of </span>Justice
dated January 9, 1973 and <span style="">this </span><span style="">time, </span>the
Undersecretary of Justice in <span style="">his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> of </span>August 12, 1977 affirmed the order of
the Commissioner of Immigration and Deporta­tion dated March 5, 1971, granting
the petition to cancel the alien <span style="">certificate
of registration </span>of petitioner "it appearing from <span style="">the </span>within records and the additional
documents submitted to this Department that he was born on May 27, 1947 <span style="">in Manila, the legitimate </span>child of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pelagio</span></span><span style=""> Philip <span class="SpellE">Quilala</span>, an
American citizen, and Julia </span>Ramos, a Filipino citizen prior to her
marriage, and that within a reasonable time after attaining the age of
majority, he elected Philippine citizenship pursuant to the provisions of
Section 1 (4), Article IV, of the 1935 Constitution, <span style="">in relation to Section </span>1 (3), Article III, of the present
Constitution, and Commonwealth Act No. 625 (1941), thereby <span style="">becoming </span>a citizen of the
Philippines."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the petition is in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is <span style="">no </span>question that <span style="">petitioner,
born </span>of a Filipino mother and an American citizen has the right to elect
Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority which petitioner
elected on May 26, 1970 at the age of 23 years and immediately took his oath of
allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines on the same day, which documents
were duly registered in the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City on May 28, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the Undersecretary of Justice
reconsidered his order denying the cancellation of the alien certificate of
registration of the petitioner by the Commissioner of Immigration, and affirmed
the cancellation of petitioner's alien registry, there is no more legal
obstacle to his becoming a Filipino citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, </span>the petition is granted, allowing <span style="">petitioner to be reinstated in the roll of
attorneys and to be re-admitted to the practice of law in the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
