				<H3>ESTEBAN TAWATAO AND LOURDES DEL ROSARIO, PETITIONERS, VS. EUGENIO GARCIA, VIRGINIA DE VERA AND HON. LEON P. DACAYO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS (FIRST REGIONAL DISTRICT) LINGAYEN, PANGASINAN, RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari to annul a
  judgment rendered by the Court of Agrarian Relations,
  Lingayen, Pangasinan, in CAR case No. 539-P-58, and for
  a writ of preliminary injunction, under section 7 of Rule		
		  
				
				  
		
		  67, Rules of Court, to preserve the <i>status quo</i> of the parties
  in relation to the litigated matter pending these proceedings.  
		<p>On 14 February 1958 Eugenio Garcia and Virginia de
  Vera filed a petition (Annex A) in the Court of Agrarian
  Relations, First Regional District, Lingayen, Pangasinan,
  alleging that since 1935 they have been the tenants of a
  parcel of nipa land containing an area of one-half hectare
  situate in the barrio of Camaley, municipality of Binmaley, province of Pangasinan, owned by the spouses
  Juliana Claudio and Pablo Tawatao, residents of Muñoz,
  Nueva Ecija; that in 1950 they agreed to convert the nipa
  land into a fishpond, the expenses for such conversion to
  be shared equally by both parties, as well as the products
  of the fishpond; that for the construction of the fishpond
  the then petitioners, now respondents, spent the sum of
  P830, P330 of which was their own money and P500, a
  loan from one Lucio Ramirez; that after the construction
  of the fishpond Juliana Claudio and Pablo Tawatao failed
  and refused to pay their share of P400 despite demands
  for payment; that up to February 1955 they had divided
  share and share alike <i>bangus</i> and other kind of fishes
  caught in the fishpond; that in February 1955, for and in
  consideration of the sum of P700, Juliana Claudio and
  Pablo Tawatao leased for two years the fishpond to Salvador Bautista of Camaley, Binmaley, Pangasinan, in
  spite of the objection by the then petitioners, now respondents, who claimed that the lease would deprive them of
  their annual share amounting to P350; that sometime in
  1956 the owners of the fishpond donated it <i>propter nuptias</i>  to their children Esteban Tawatao and Lourdes del Rosario,
  the herein petitioners, who immediately took possession
  thereof, introduced improvements and refused to restore
  possession thereof to then petitioners, respondents herein,
  despite demands; and that as a result of their dispossession
  from the fishpond they suffered losses and damages. The
  then petitioners prayed that they be reinstated as tenants		
		  
				
				  
		
		  of the fishpond, be paid the amount of P400, the share of
  the former owners of the parcel of nipa land in the expenses incurred in converting it into fishpond, P750 as
  their share in the products of the fishpond for the years
  from 1955 to 1957, P300 as attorney's fees and incidental
  expenses and P1,300 as moral, nominal and exemplary
  damages. </p>
		<p>
In their answer the herein petitioners, then respondents, and their
co-respondents, predecessors-in-interest, denied each and every
material allegation of the petition (CAR case No. 539-P-58) and claimed
that in 1955 the then petitioners, now respondents, Garcia and de Vera
left the fishpond; that Juliana Claudio and Pablo Tawatao leased it to
Salvador Bautista and after the termination of the lease in 1956
donated it to their son Esteban Tawatao, herein petitioner, in
consideration of his marriage to Lourdes del Rosario. By way of
counterclaim the then respondents claimed that the then petitioners
Garcia and de Vera failed and refused to render an accounting for the
harvests in the agricultural years 1953-1955 amounting to P450; that to
defend themselves against the complaint of the then petitioners they
paid P250 for attorney's fees; and that they suffered moral and
exemplary damages in the sum of P1,500. </p>
		<p>Notwithstanding the notice of the date and time of
    hearing duly served upon and received by counsel of the
    then respondents, their counsel failed to appear. Thereupon, the then petitioners moved to be allowed to present
    their evidence and the motion was granted. </p>
		<p>The evidence presented by the then petitioners substantially supports the allegations of their petition.
    After trial, the Court of Agrarian Relations rendered
    judgment, as follows: </p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>Wherefore,
the respondents are hereby ordered to reinstate the petitioners as
tenants in the landholding-fishpond located (situate) at Bo. Camaley,
Binmaley, Pangasinan, having an area of one-half (1/2) hectare, more or
less, and to maintain them in the peaceful possession and cultivation
of the same. The respondents are likewise ordered to pay to the
petitioners the amount of P1,200.00 as damages for unlawful
dispossession and P300.00 yearly from 1959 until the petitioners are
actually reinstated. (Annex B) </p>
</blockquote>
		<p>In their petition the herein petitioners contend that
  Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No.
  2263, that governs the relations between landholders and
  tenants under both the share and leasehold tenancies of agricultural lands for cultivation does not apply to fishponds,
  for in the latter there is no cultivation of the land to
  speak of, insist that section 42 of Republic Act No. 1199
  and section 7 of Republic Act No. 1267 do not apply to
  fishponds and residential lots but to agricultural lands
  only subject to cultivation. Corollary to the issue of
  lack of jurisdiction, the herein petitioners also maintain
  that the basis of the complaint or petition is not a contract of share or leasehold tenancy but at most is one of
  partnership under article 1767 of the Civil Code.</p>
		<p> In their answer to the petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction, the herein respondents Garcia and
    de Vera aver that their complaint is not predicated merely
    upon a contract of conversion of the nipa land into fishpond and recovery of half of the amount spent for such
    conversion as agreed upon, but one for reinstatement under
    section 21, Republic Act No. 1199, as tenants of the herein
    petitioners, and damages arising from their unlawful dispossession from and of the fishpond; that it is correct that
    they never entered into a contract of tenancy with the
    petitioners herein, but the fact is that there was an implied
    tenancy relation between them from 1935 to 1955 which
    was disturbed when in 1955 the fishpond was leased and
    in 1956 donated to the herein petitioners, a donation or
    transfer that cannot deprive the respondent tenants of
    their right to continue as such. Only for causes enumerated by law and only after the same shall have been
    proved before and the dispossession shall have been		
		    
				
						    
		
		    authorized by the court may a tenant be dispossessed of
    his holding.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="STYLE2 STYLE1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>  </p>
		<p>The answer of the judge who presided over the respondent Court is to the same effect on the issue of jurisdiction.  </p>
		<p>The point to determine in this case is, are the herein
  respondents Eugenio Garcia and Virginia de Vera entitled
  to reinstatement in the fishpond under section 27 of
  Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No.
  2263, and damages?  </p>
		<p>The petitioners' argument that Republic Act No. 1199,
  as amended, applies only to agricultural lands fit for cultivation and not to fishponds, because by nature the latter
  are not susceptible of cultivation, is without merit, for
  section 46 of said Act, as amended, which partly provides
  that—</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>
(c) The consideration for the use of sugar lands, fishponds, saltbeds
and of lands devoted to the raising of livestock shall be governed by
stipulation between the parties. </p>
</blockquote>
		<p>is clear and needs no interpretation. The law does not
  require actual cultivation of the land so that disputes
  affecting tenancy relation involving a landholding fall
  under it. While the above section provides that the consideration for the use of fishpond shall be governed by
  stipulation between the parties yet the same does not strip
  the Court of Agrarian Relations of its jurisdiction over
  tenancy disputes involving such kind of landholding.
  Furthermore, this Court already has held that land in
  which fish is produced is classified as agricultural land
  and that the words "real estate" include fisheries as used
  in article 55 of the Hague Conventions of 1907.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="STYLE2 STYLE1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> In this
  case involving, as it does, unlawful dispossession of the
  respondent tenants from their fishpond holding upon  no 		
		  
						
						  
		
		  legal cause, as provided for in sections 27, 49 and 50 of
  Republic Act No. 1199 as amended by Republic Act No.
  2263, the Court of Agrarian Relations has exclusive jurisdiction to order the reinstatement and payment of damages
  for losses suffered by them, and for that reason the proceedings and the judgment rendered in this case being in
  accordance with law are valid and binding.  </p>
		<p>The
claim that because "they (herein petitioners) have been in actual
possession of the land for a period of two years prior to the filing of
the complaint by the respondent spouses," "the respondent court has no
jurisdiction over the case," is without merit, because such
jurisdiction over the subject matter does not depend on whether or not
at the time of the filing of the proper action there was a tenancy
relation between the parties. Neither does the bringing of the action
three years after the respondent tenants had been unlawfully
dispossessed of the fishpond negate the existence of tenancy relation
nor does it constitute or amount to a waiver of the right to
reinstatement, for Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, does not provide
for a prescriptive period within which to file a complaint for unlawful
dispossession. </p>
		<p>The writ prayed for is denied, with costs against the
    petitioners. </p>
