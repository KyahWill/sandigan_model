				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">To state the basis of the order of July 16, 1966 of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, Branch XXII, the Honorable Federico C. <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span> presiding, dismissing an action filed by
plaintiff-appellant Phoenix Assurance Company against the Republic of the Philippines
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, the state not being susceptible to a
suit without its consent, is to make manifest the appropriate disposition of
this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its fate is foreordained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reversal of the lower court decision is
unthinkable.</p>

<p class="BODY">An action was filed against defendants, now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
Republic of the Philippines and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, on June 11, 1966, in view of the claims for losses and damages for
failure of the latter, as <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, to
deliver on two occasions five cartons of cigarettes, with the rest of the
merchandise delivered but in a damaged condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such goods were insured with
plaintiff-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had to pay the
claims thereon, thereby subrogating <span class="GramE">itself</span> to whatever
rights <span style="">of recovery the consignee
had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made demands on now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service
for the amounts involved, but there was a failure and refusal to satisfy such
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence the action filed on
<st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a motion to dismiss on the part of
defendants, now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, Republic <span style="">of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the principal ground being the lack of
jurisdiction under </span>the doctrine of non-suability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted, the <span style="">order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="7"><span style="">July 16, </span>1966</st1:date> sustained
the above motion, the complaint being dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal was taken direct <span style="">to
this </span>Court on a <span style="">pure question of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As above made clear, the futility
thereof is undeniable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Only last September of
this year, in Providence Washington </span>Insurance Co. v. Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">we had occasion to dismiss an appeal in
view of </span>the 1966 authoritative Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc.
decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein such, immunity from suit, absent its consent, was given affirmation in
the most categorical language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
noted by us that there were thirty-six <span style="">subsequent
cases upholding such a </span>view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
could then categorically assert:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The doctrine of non-suability thus holds undisputed sway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its primacy appears to be undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a suit of this character <span style="">to prosper, there </span>must be a showing of
consent either in express terms or by implication through the use of statutory
language too plain to be misinterpreted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its absence being <span style="">obvious, </span>the
lower court acted correctly."</p>

<p class="BODY">So it is in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court did right and must be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is the reason advanced in the brief of appellant Phoenix Assurance
Company as to the desirability of a doctrine permitting such a suit, in view of
the government engaging in business, commend itself for approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same Providence Washington Insurance
Co. decision, we had occasion to explain why there should be no departure from
the doctrine of non-suability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is not to deny
that while indeed logical and far from impractical the doctrine does give rise
to problems considering how widely immersed in matters hitherto deemed out­side
its sphere the government is at present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is it likely considering its expanding role, demanded by the times
and warranted by the Constitution, that a halt would be called to many of its
acti­vities, at times unavoidably adversely affecting private rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None­theless, a continued adherence to the
doctrine of non-suability is not to be deplored for <span style="">as </span>against the inconvenience that may be caused private parties,
the loss of governmental efficiency and the obstacle to the performance of its
multifarious functions are far greater if such a fundamental principle were
abandoned and the availability of judicial remedy were not thus
restricted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the well known propensity
on the part of our people to go to court, at the least provocation, the loss of
time and energy required to defend against law suits, in the absence of such a
basic principle that constitutes such an effective obstacle, could very well be
imagined."</p>
