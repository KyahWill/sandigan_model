the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present petition stems from facts following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Candidates for Mayor of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span>
in the November 14, 1967 elections were <span class="SpellE">reelectionist</span>
petitioner Salvador Q. <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Protesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 13, 1967, the municipal board of canvassers, composed
of Vice Mayor Domingo P. <span class="SpellE">Cadag</span>, chairman; and Salazar
<span class="SpellE">Floranza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sequitin</span>, Luis <span class="SpellE">Bagamasbad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> Nunez, Bernardino Cortez, Mario <span class="SpellE">Tarog</span> and Justinian Perez, members (hereinafter to be
referred to as the <u>first</u> <u>board</u>), convened to canvass the election
returns for said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that board had canvasses 27 precincts, and "upon opening the 28th Election
Return," the board found that "the said Election Return for Precinct
No. 28 was colored white with serial number 439026, instead of the usual pink
color with serial number 439011." Objection to said return was thereupon
raised by board member Salazar <span class="SpellE">Floranza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Barbara Portugal, local <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Registrar, intervened and asked the board to
proceed with the counting of the questionable election return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board finally sustained Salazar, resolved
to send back to the board of inspectors of Precinct 28 the said election return
"to explain the discrepancy."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the members left except member <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1987</st1:date>,
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region> directed
the first board to convene anew and continue with the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region>
named a new board of canvassers (the <u>second</u> <u>board</u>) composed of
Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>, chairman; and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span>,
Tito <span class="SpellE">Pajes</span>, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Espinas</span>
and Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Gnilo</span>, members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This new board used the same tally sheet by
verifying it with the election returns presented by the municipal
treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second board completed
its work.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day - December 14 - the second board, together with <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> of the first
board, signed both the tally sheet and the certificate of canvass and
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said certificate and the
tally sheet show that respondent <span class="SpellE">Protesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span> garnered 2,143 votes as against petitioner Salvador
Q. <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> who obtained 2,086 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second board, with <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>,
proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Protesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>
Mayor-elect.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 19, 1967, respondent Commission on Elections (<span class="SpellE"><u>Comelec</u></span>) - concerned with the delay in proclamation
- resolved to direct that an attorney of its Law Department proceed immediately
to <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, and
bring with him <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> copy of the election return
from Precinct 28 for the use of the canvassing board of said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution explicitly directed said
attorney "to supervise the canvass and proclamation with the authority to
suspend recalcitrant members of the municipal board of canvassers and appoint
their substitutes." Named as such supervising attorney was respondent <span class="SpellE">Gertrudo</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1967</st1:date>, the first board, whose members were suspended by Election
Registrar <st1:country-region><st1:place>Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
convened again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first board then
claimed that the board of inspectors of Precinct 28 failed to explain the
discrepancy in color and serial number of the election return from said precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This first board did not notify the municipal
treasurer who was in possession of the election returns and the proclamation
paper and tally sheets used during the canvass of <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither was the election registrar notified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board's session was held in the house of
petitioner and <span class="SpellE">reelectionist</span> Mayor Salvador Q. <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span>, without <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
supervision, without the election returns or any of the documents or any
official forms being produced thereat by the municipal treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes of said board for that day
(December 22) show that the canvassers just "agreed to take into
consideration whatever figure or information contained in the questioned
Election Return of Precinct No. 28," and "then con­tinued to get the
sum total of each candidate <u>as</u> <u>per</u> <u>their</u> <u>noted</u> <u>record</u>
during the first meeting."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The aforesaid first board prepared an improvised tally sheet and proclamation
paper without seeing the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proclamation of petitioner Salvador Q. <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span>
made by the first board on this date, December 22, is found in the last paragraph
of the minutes of the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
proclamation was merely based on the improvised tally which shows the following
votes for Mayor:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Salvador Q.
Pedido, 2,131 votes; respondent Protesto P<span class="SpellE">avia</span>, 2,098
votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1967</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Gertrudo</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> Super­visor, conferred with the municipal
treasurer, the election registrar, and the municipal secretary of <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that
day, Supervisor <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span> issued an order - subject
to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> confirmation -(a) setting aside the
proclamation of December 14, 1967 made by the second board, because the same
was without prior knowledge or con­firmation by the Commission, and also
because of the resolution of December 19, 1967 requiring the canvassing board
to use in its canvass <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> copy of the election
return for Precinct 28; (b) declaring "null and void" the
proclamation made by the first board on December 22, 1967, for the reasons that
there was lack of proper notice to the election registrar of <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span> (in violation of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
standing instructions to all canvassing boards) and also to the municipal
treasurer who had all the election documents and paraphernalia to be used as
basis for preparing the tally sheet and certificate of canvass and
proclamation; and that the meeting of the first board was held in the Mayor's
house.</p>

<p class="BODY">That same day, <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span> directed the
first board, which con­vened on December 13 and December 22, to convene anew at
<st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> a. m. the next day, <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1967</st1:date>, at the session
hall. At <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time> of that day, the
canvassers absented themselves; only their chairman, Domingo P. <span class="SpellE">Cadag</span>, was present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The meeting of the board was post­poned to <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
<st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 p.m.</st1:time>, again solely chairman <span class="SpellE">Cadag</span> appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cadag</span> vigorously objected to reconvening the board,
insisted that the canvass and proclamation of <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1967</st1:date> made by the first board be respected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Faced by the recalcitrance of the members of the first board to
appear and the adamant attitude of the chairman, <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span>
suspended all the members of the said first board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be substituted them by another board of
canvassers (the <u>third</u> <u>board</u>) who are qualified voters, as
recommended by the municipal treasurer, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Barbara Portugal, chairman; and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Libag</span>, Mrs. Loreto C.
Portugal, Mrs. Fe A. Medrano, <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Oyales</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> D. Luna, and <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> <span class="SpellE">Arranza</span>, members.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, this third board canvassed the returns from all
the precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they used <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> copy of the election return from Precinct 28,
pursuant to <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> directive of <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1967</st1:date>. The third board's
certificate of canvass and proclamation of <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1967</st1:date> and the tally sheet show that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Protesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>
with 2,143 votes won over petitioner Salvador Q. <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span>
who obtained 2,086 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the discrepancy between the votes appearing in the first
board's improvised tally of <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1967</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Pedido</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2,131 votes; <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2,098 votes) and the third board's

examine the reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are three tally sheets:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the tally sheet used in the December 13 canvass by the first board and
also in the December 14 canvass by the second board; the improvised tally sheet
of the first board on December 22; and the tally sheet prepared by the third
board in the December 28 canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following tabulation, appearing on page 11 of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> answer to the petition herein, explains how

"be adopted as the valid certificate and that all acts taken by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gertrudo</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span> in connection
with said canvass and proclamation are hereby confirmed. "</p>

<p class="BODY">Challenged here as null and void is the proclamation of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Protesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stress of petitioners' argument is that
since petitioner Salvador Q. <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> was already
proclaimed by the first board on <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1967</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has "lost
jurisdiction over his person and any question regarding his
election."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They submit that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Protesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia's</span>
remedy is "an election protest before our courts," and that <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1968</st1:date> "long after <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span>
was proclaimed and had taken his oath," was issued "beyond its
jurisdiction."</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are called upon to
resolve the decisive question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1967</st1:date> proclamation made
by the first board valid? For two reasons, the answer must be in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty of
the municipal board of canvassers to count the votes cast for candidates for
municipal offices as shown in <u>all</u> the election returns produced by the
municipal treasurer, cannot be avoided.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Repeatedly has this Court ruled that the board of can­vassers is to be guided by
election returns <u>transmitted</u> to it "which are in due form."
Indeed, the board must be "satisfied of the genuineness of the
returns."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> A
canvass made on incomplete returns may be annulled.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And yet, at the session of the first board of December 22, the members
thereof made an improvised tally and proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span>
winner - <u>without</u> <u>examining</u> the election returns, or a single
election return, for that matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
did not have and could not have the returns before them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, those documents were in the pos­session
of the municipal treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the
municipal treasurer was not notified of that canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not even have the tally sheets used
in their December 13 session.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that
the board did was "<u>to</u> <u>get</u> <u>the</u> <u>sum</u> <u>total</u>
<u>of</u> <u>each</u> <u>candidate</u> <u>as</u> <u>per</u> <u>their</u> <u>noted</u>
<u>record</u> <u>during</u> <u>the</u> <u>first</u> <u>meeting</u>,” plus
"<u>whatever</u> <u>figure</u> <u>or</u> <u>information</u> <u>obtained</u>
<u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>questioned</u> <u>Election</u> <u>Return</u> <u>of</u> <u>Precinct</u>
<u>No</u>. <u>28</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> as Mayor-elect was
based - quoting from the minutes of the first board's meeting of December 22 -
"on the correct sum total as shown by the records of the Board of
Canvassers" - not on the election returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">The net result is that no canvass at all was made on December
22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without canvass, there can be no
proclamation by the first board.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot afford to depart from the wise rule that canvass can
only be made from the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without the returns, what is there to canvass?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mischief that stems from a contrary rule
need not be elaborately essayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice
it to say that the flood gates to fraud will be wide open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, temporizing with the first board's
so-called "noted record [of votes made by them] during the first
meeting," to arrive at the number of votes cast for the candidates, must
be vigorously condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A high regard
for the people's will expressed at the polls is the hallmark of our election
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this score alone, that proclamation - without canvass - of <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1967</st1:date> must be nullified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged
tally used in the first board's meeting of December 22 is admittedly in an
improvised form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, that tally
was not based on any election return produced before the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But more important is that there is an
obvious fabrication of figures for the two candidates for Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that the minutes of the
meeting of the same first board of December 13, 1967 shows that by 3:00 o'clock
in the afternoon of that day, they have already canvassed 27 precincts, which
includes Precincts 7 and 8, and had to stop only when they reached "the
28th Precinct Return."</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the so-called tally sheet prepared by the first
board on that day (December 22) covering Precincts 7 and 8 reveals
figure-manipulation in those precincts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, as shown in the tally of December 13 made by the same first board,
in Precinct No. 7, <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> received 121 votes, and in
Precinct No. 8, 73 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
improvised tally sheet, as aforesaid, <span class="SpellE">Pedido's</span> votes
were upped to 145 votes in Precinct 7, and to 94 votes in Precinct 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is an excess of 45 votes to favor <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In turn, in
the tally sheet of December 13, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city>
got 217 votes in Precinct 7, and 106 votes in Precinct 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the improvised tally sheet of December 22,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span> votes shrank to 193 votes in Precinct 7, and to 85 votes
in Precinct 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pavia</span></st1:place></st1:city> thus was made to lose 45
votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The members of that first board knew all along the votes tallied
for each of the two contending mayoralty candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for these two precincts, 7 and 8, the
votes of the two in all the three tallies remained as they were; and except for
the office of Mayor, there was no change in the winning column for all the
other candidates for municipal offices.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a deliberate attempt by the first board to frustrate the
people's will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so, the first board
had to conjure up the scheme of juggling figures that would make <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> the Mayor-elect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were too eager to proclaim him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They probably thought then, as they urge upon us now, that once <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> is proclaimed, the other candidate will be left without
recourse except to file an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we have pointedly stated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ong</u></span> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, <u>supra</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> But
to be accentuated is the corner­stone tenet in elections of public officers
that the choice of the people expressed at the polls should not be frustrated
by wrongful acts which can be remedied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A defeated candidate may
grab proclamation, take his seat, while he keeps the victim out by a long drawn
expensive election protest - if protest the latter can afford.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Important is that
a canvass and proclamation be made on the basis of authentic returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The end to be achieved more than compensates
the effort, money, and time expended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As we draw enlightenment gained from experience on the
"grab-the proclamation-prolong-the-protest slogan" indulged in, in
election after election, we must vigorously reject illegal proclamation to
prevent it from congealing into a pattern of conduct in elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appropriately to be recalled at this point is
the Incisive reminder of Mr. Chief Justice Cesar <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Climaco</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>, that "[t]he well-known delay in the adjudication of election
protests often gave the successful contestant a mere pyrrhic victory, i.e., a
vindication when the term of office is about to expire, or has expired."</p>

<p class="BODY">And again, we say that the first board's proclamation of December
22, 1967 is null and void.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By Section 3 of the
Revised Election Code, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has "direct and
immediate supervision" over the municipal board of canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That statutory provision empowers <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to suspend from the per­formance of their duties
any member of the board of canvassers "who shall fail to comply with its
instructions, orders, decisions, or rulings and appoint their temporary
substitutes." Jurisprudence has since stabilized that power.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This, of course, is in pursuance of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
constitutionally prescribed duty to enforce "all laws relative to the con­duct
of elections," to decide "all administrative questions, affecting
elections," and to insure "free, orderly, and honest elections."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Paying full respect to these precepts, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> gave
express authority to <span class="SpellE">Gertrudo</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span>
to supervise the canvass and proclamation with power to suspend the
recalcitrant members of the board of canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span>
and to appoint their substitutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see
no illegality in <span class="SpellE">Comelecs</span> act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Effective administration and enforcement of
the election laws require it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commissioners are not expected to do all the functions of office personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should not
be hamstrung in its efforts to promptly dispose of election cases before
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the act of the
subordinate official may be annulled or reversed by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span> complied with his duty
is beyond debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave a chance to
the first board to convene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
patient enough to postpone the canvass and proclamation to give the disobedient
members of the first board time to come.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But they did not, not even for the second time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead their Chairman adamantly stood by the
December 22 proclamation made by the said board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span>
correctly suspended them and appointed a new board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is the board that proclaimed
respondent <span class="SpellE">Protesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Pavia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are unable to join petitioners in their view that simply
because petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> was proclaimed Mayor, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had lost jurisdiction to annul the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rule of frequent application is that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is with authority to annul any canvass and
proclamation which was illegally made.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
So that, when <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, in its resolution of January
5, 1968, approved the order of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Supervisor <span class="SpellE">Kalambakal</span> (issued in <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span>),
which declared null and void the December 22 proclamation, and adopted the
certificate of canvass and proclamation of December 28, 1967 as "the valid
certificate" of canvass and proclamation, it certainly acted within its
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, the petition for certiorari herein is
denied; the December 22, 1967 proclamation of petitioner Salvador Q. <span class="SpellE">Pedido</span> as Mayor-elect of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pioduran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, as well as his
