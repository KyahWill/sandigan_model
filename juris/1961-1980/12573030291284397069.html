				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><h2></h2><p>After appropriate proceedings, the Court 
of First Instance of Quezon rendered a decision on 13 July 1950 authorizing Tiu 
San's naturalization as a Filipino citizen. Upon the lapse of the 2-year 
probationary period, or, on July 24, 1952, he petitioned the same court, under 
Republic Act No. 530, to be allowed to take the oath of allegiance as a citizen 
of the Republic. On June 3, 1953, however, the petition was denied since at the 
hearing thereon, it was found that in the intervening probationary period, Tiu 
San <i>alias</i> Angel Gomez, had been convicted of a violation of Municipal 
Ordinance No. 14, Series of 1946 of Lucena, Quezon, and for which he was fined 
P50.00. </p>
<p>Subsequently, Tiu San appealed to this Court the order which denied his oath 
taking. On April 20, 1955, this Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the 
order of denial (G.R. No. L-7301).</p>
<p>Some three years later, or, on January 27, 1958, Tiu San <i>alias</i> Gomez 
filed another petition with the Court of First Instance of Quezon praying for 
the issuance in his favor of the corresponding certificate of naturalization 
after due hearing pursuant to Republic Act No. 530. As a ground therefor, he 
alleged that on December 23, 1957, he was granted absolute and unconditional 
pardon by the President of the Philippines for his conviction of the aforestated 
municipal ordinance of Lucena, Quezon. The trial court, however, after the 
pleadings in support of and in opposition to the new petition had been filed by 
the respective parties the Provincial Fiscal and Solicitor General on one hand 
and the herein respondent Tiu San on the other in an order dated February 5, 
1958, denied once more herein respondent's oath-taking. Besides, a motion for a 
reconsideration of this order was likewise denied in an order dated March 13, 
1958.</p>
<p>About 9 montlis later—January 30, 1959—respondent Tiu San filed another 
petition to take his oath of allegiance, which, naturally, was opposed anew by 
the Government. For one reason or another, this last petition remained 
unresolved by the trial court for over a year so that oh February 22, 1960, 
respondent Tiu San petitioned the said lower, court to set a date for the 
hearing of his aforecited petition dated January 30, 1959. Upon this latest 
pleading, herein respondent Judge Enrique Maglanoc issued an order setting a 
date for the hearing of the latter's petition. </p>
<p>Thus, the present petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary 
injunction.</p>
<p>The Government maintains that respondent Tiu San's last petition for the 
issuance of a certificate of naturalization, after similar petitions have been 
denied by the lower court and affirmed by the Supreme Court, amounts to, and is 
in effect a petition for relief from judgment or order under Rule 38 of the 
Rules of Court. Consequently, it should not be made to prosper for the reason 
that the legal period within which the same may be filed has long elapsed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tiu San disavows the charge that he seeks to be relieved 
from the previous orders denying the issuance of a certificate of naturalization 
in his favor. He maintains that the original decision of July 13, 1950 of the 
trial court admitting him as a citizen of the Philippines, the dispositive 
portion of which reads of follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In View Whereof, let the proper naturalization certificate he issued in his 
favor and the registration of the same in the proper civil register as required 
by Sec. 10 of Act 375 upon qualifying himself by taking the required oath of 
office, once this decision becomes final and executory."</p></blockquote>
<p>is still executory. He vigorously asserts that the same petition to be 
allowed to qualify for Filipino citizenship is merely "a sequence to the 
aforesaid decision" of the lower court admitting him a citizen of the 
Philippines. Furthermore, he alleged that "there is no law, nor does R.A. 530 
limit the period of time after 2 years to file a petition for the issuance of a 
naturalization certificate in conjunction with the basic decision; nor is there 
any limitation on the number of petitions to be filed, especially so when the 
ground for the denial in the previous petitions exists no longer."</p>
<p>The arguments of the parties herein, in the final analysis, result from the 
only issue of this case, which is, We hold, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the effect of the previous denials of Tiu San's petition for the 
issuance of a certificate of naturalization upon the basic decision granting him 
Filipino citizenship?</p></blockquote>
<p>We find for the Government. </p>
<p>In the case of Tiu San, <i>alias</i> Angel Gomez vs. Republic of the 
Philippines, 96 Phil., 817, promulgated April 20, 1955, this Court has already 
ruled that when the petitioner, herein respondent, violated Lucena Municipal 
Ordinance No. 41, series of 1946, for which he was convicted on April 25, 1952, 
he became barred from securing the corresponding certificate of naturalization 
despite the decision granting his petition for naturalization, thus in fact 
nullifying the basic decision. In other words, as of the time that the order 
denying the issuance of a certificate of naturalization became final, that 
particular naturalization proceeding ended and terminated. And still more 
recently, in the case of Isasi y Larrabide vs. Republic of the Philippines, 101 
Phil., 405, We have likewise laid down the rule that the failure of an applicant 
for naturalization to pass the 2-year probationary period results in the loss of 
whatever rights he may have acquired under the decision authorizing his 
naturalization inasmuch as the same decision is rendered nullified. Furthermore, 
in the same case, We held that the case cannot be revived and declared to be 
still valid and executory.</p>
<p>It is of no moment whether an absolute and unconditional pardon has been 
granted to the herein respondent Tiu San. Whatever be its nature, whether it 
removes the moral stain of the conviction or not, the fact still remains that it 
was granted subsequent to the denial of his first petition for the issuance of a 
certificate of naturalization. It is well settled that a pardon has no 
retrospective operation (67 C.J.S. Section 11, page 578). It can have no effect 
upon judicial proceedings already terminated.</p>
<p>Respondent Tiu San also filed an amended answer to the instant petition and 
claims that the failure of the State to file a motion for reconsideration with 
the lower court renders this same petition fatally defective.</p>
<p>A, a general rule, a writ of prohibition will not be issued to an inferior 
court unless the attention of the court whose proceedings is sought to be 
arrested has been called to the alleged lack or excess of jurisdiction. However, 
a number of exceptions to that rule are judicially recognized. Thus, the 
aforecited rule has been held inapplicable to ex-parte proceedings; or to 
proceedings in which the applicant for the writ had no opportunity to object; or 
where it is apparent that an objection to the lower court would have been 
unavailing and futile, or would result in unnecessary or hurtful delay; or where 
to make objection in the inferior court would be to destroy its very purpose; or 
where a want of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the record (50 C.J.S., 
697-698, cited in III Francisco, Rules of Court, p. 170-171.)</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered annulling the order 
of the herein respondent Judge setting the date for the hearing of the petition 
dated Jan. 30, 1959, and, enjoining him or his successor to refrain from acting 
further on the matter, With costs against respondent Tiu San.</p>
