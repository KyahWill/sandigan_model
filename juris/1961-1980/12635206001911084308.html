				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an automatic review of the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> in its Criminal Case No. 12646
dated <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1969</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERA­TIONS, the Court, finding
the accused <span class="SpellE">Lu­cio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, defined and pena­lized by
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Acts Nos. 2632
and 4111, and there being aggravating circumstances of the commission of the
offense in the dwelling of the offended party by two persons and with the use of
deadly wea­pons (bolos), without the attendance of any mitigating circumstance,
hereby imposes upon the accused the extreme penalty of death by electrocution
to be meted upon the accused in accordance with existing law, rules and
regulations governing the same and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused is directed to acknowledge any
offspring which Leonora <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> might bear by reason
of the commission of this act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as established by the evidence for the prosecution,
are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> had two houses in <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-an,
which was their usual place of sojourn and where their five minor children,
namely, Leonora, 15, Norma, 13, Ester, 12, Jose, 10, and <span class="SpellE">Myriam</span>,
6, also stayed, and another, about one kilometer away, at Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Buenavista</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every now and then the couple had to go to
Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Buenavista</span></span><span class="GramE"> for a few days to attend to their crops.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">March
 1, 1968</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> spou­ses departed
from Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cadac</span></span><span class="GramE">-an, leaving their children there, for Bo.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Buenavista</span></span><span class="GramE"> where
they stayed over the night.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of that same day, the <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> children were awakened by two flashes of light
beamed upon their faces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By means of a
lighted vigil kero­sene lamp near the doorway leading to the room, as well as
of the flashlights, the two oldest children, Leonora and Norma, recognized the
nocturnal intruders as <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>,
single, whose house was only about one hundred meters from the <span class="SpellE">Paderos</span>' house, and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Perez, who was a resident of Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Buenavista</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The children had
known <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> for about four years, and Perez for
some­time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Leonora was then dragged by <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> to
the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, which adjoined the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other children, stricken with fear,
huddled together on top of a trunk near the doorway connecting the room to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When already
in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> not more than two meters away from the
trunk, <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> struck the back of Leonora's head with
his hand, causing her to fall on the floor, face downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other children could do no more than cry
because Perez, with a bolo in hand, was blocking the doorway between the room
and the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and threatening them with harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> turned over
Leonora's body, placed himself on top of her, unsheathed his bolo, and,
threatening her with death if she shouted, placed the bolo by her side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonora struggled by moving her body from one
side to another; she did not, however, shout, for fear of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of Leonora's resistance, <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> succeeded in having carnal intercourse with
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After warning her not to report the
matter to the authorities, <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> stood up and left
her lying on the floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two men exchanged places.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perez approached Leonora, turned her face in an upward direction, threat­ened
her with his bolo, and placed himself on top of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although Leonora resisted his attempts by
kicking him on the stomach, Perez was able to consummate the sexual act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>,
bolo in hand, was blocking the doorway.</p>

<p class="BODY">After committing the dastardly crimes, <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>
and Perez left the house of the <span class="SpellE">Paderos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning Leonora and Norma proceeded to Bo. <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> and informed their parents of the in­cident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All four of them went to the municipal hall
in <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span> and reported the matter to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards they went to the Rural Health
Center of <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span> where the Municipal Health Officer,
Dr. Lorenzo S. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>, con­ducted a physical
examination of Leonora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found her in
mental shock and suffering from a slight swelling on the back of her head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl was later taken to a hospital for a
vaginal examination, after which Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>
executed a medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "C")
which contains the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Slight swelling at the occipital area, tense
and tender on pressure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vaginal examination reveals lacera­tion at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> and at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
yellowish fluid is seen in the <span class="SpellE">vulvar</span> ca­vity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Microscopic examination of smear taken from
the vaginal cavity reveals pre­sence of motile and non-motile spermatozoa under
the low-powered and high-powered lens."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Later, the doctor was to explain on the
witness stand that the vaginal laceration was fresh on the day of the
examination; that something, possibly a male organ, was inserted in the vaginal
cavity; and that some of the spermatozoa he had found were highly motile, i.e.,
alive and moving.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the medical examination the four members of the <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> family went back to the police headquarters, but
they were told to come back later because the police were quite busy with other
matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They returned seve­ral days
later, during which they were interrogated by the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1968</st1:date>,
a complaint for rape, subscribed and sworn by Leonora <span class="SpellE">Padero</span>
before the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, was filed
against <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Pe­rez; and on the same day a warrant for their
arrest was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1968</st1:date>, policeman <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Laher</span>, whose wife was a
cousin of <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>, went to the house of the latter to
serve the warrant; but <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His mother told the policeman that <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> was not at home, and, upon further inquiry by the
police­man, she said that she did not know where her son was that day or the
day before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1968</st1:date>, policeman <span class="SpellE">Laher</span>
would pass by <span class="SpellE">Amiscua's</span> place hoping to be able to
serve the warrant, but <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> was invariably not at
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He inquired of <span class="SpellE">Amiscua's</span>
whereabouts from other persons in the barrio, who told him that his quarry had
already left the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until
<st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1969</st1:date>, or one year and
two months after the incident, that <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> was arrested in his house at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Ca­dac</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> by policeman <span class="SpellE">Laher</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Perez, the record shows that he was never
arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite of the fact that the
sworn complaint for rape filed by the offended party charged not only Lucia <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> but also <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Perez,
the Provincial <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> information charged only the
former, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
accuses <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> of
the crime of Rape, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 1st day of March, 1968, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Philippines, and within the juris­diction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together
with one <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Perez who is pre­sently at large
and whose present where­abouts is still unknown, and mutually help­ing each
other, with the use of deadly wea­pons and by means of force, violence and
intimidation, did, then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal know­ledge with Leonora <span class="SpellE">Padero</span>, a minor of thir­teen years of age; committed in the
dwelling of the latter, against her will and to her damage and prejudice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended
by Republic Acts Nos. 2632 and 4111."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">About one week after <span class="SpellE">Amiscua's</span> arrest,
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Leo­poldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cepeda</span> of
the police force of <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, who was a godfather of <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>, together with another policeman, the barrio
captain and <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> himself, went to the <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> house at Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cadac</span></span><span class="GramE">-an.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cepeda</span> had with him P200.00, which he offered in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> to <span class="SpellE">Flo­rencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> in amicable settlement of the rape case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonora's father refused the offer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So did Leonora, who cried upon learning of
the proposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts narrated above were established on the witness stand by
the testimonies of Leonora <span class="SpellE">Padero</span>, Norma <span class="SpellE">Padero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Padero</span>, Dr. Lorenzo S. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Laher</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented two witnesses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, the barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense version was this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>
and Leonora were sweethearts; in fact they lived together as husband and wife
at the <span class="SpellE">Paderos</span>' house at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> for about two months until Feb­ruary 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonora's parents, like <span class="SpellE">Amiscua's</span>
parents, both knew of the relationship; indeed, once in a while Leonora's parents
would stay in their house at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> where they would find <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>
and Leo­nora living as husband and wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At one time in the course of the two-month amorous relationship,
Leonora's parents brought up before the two lovers the subject of marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> asked for
time within which to se­cure the necessary funds to be used for the
wedding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parents did not say
anything to this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>
and Leonora thereafter agreed that he would go to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to look for work so he could save the necessary amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the agreement, <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> left at dawn one day in February 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He later found work in a sugar plantation in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was paid P2.00 a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
working in the plantation for about a year and saving P200.00, he left for <span class="SpellE">Anahawan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>,
for a visit with a cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stayed at
the said place for about two months, after which he went home to Bo. <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-<span class="GramE">an at</span> about the end of April
1969, proceeding directly to his mother's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having learned of the complaint filed against
him and Perez, he went to the <span class="SpellE">Paderos</span>' house, but he
was not allowed into the house by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> because the latter was mad at him, telling him that
there would be no more wedding because a complaint for rape had already been
filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
day after his arrival at Bo.</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-an, <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span> was arrested.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the defendant's theory that the complaint for rape was filed
against him because Leonora's parents had presumed that when he left the <span class="SpellE">Paderos</span>' house at dawn one day in February 1967, and failed
to return for a con­siderable length of time, he had abandoned their daugh­ter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant denied ever going to the <span class="SpellE">Paderos</span>' house with Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cepeda</span>,
the barrio captain and another policeman.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense of alibi is palpably and mi­serably
weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was positively identified by
the offended party and her sister who had a full view of the entire
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both sisters had known him for
four years because he was a neighbor; and on the night in question there was
sufficient light emanating from the kerosene lamp and the flashlights to enable
them to identify the two men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
addition, it is a natural reaction for victims of criminal violence to strive
to know the identity of their assailants, and the sole testimony of the
offended party would have sufficed to sustain a conviction (People v. <span class="SpellE">Selfaison</span>, et al., L-14732, January 28, 1961, 1 SCRA
235).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant would want the court to
believe that he left for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> about a year before <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1968</st1:date>, and stayed there
continuously after that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
testimony on this point is wholly uncorroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His life being endangered by the peril of
possible conviction of a grave crime and of the imposition of its conse­quent
penalty, it would have been worth the trouble to secure the testimony of
someone with whom he alle­gedly worked in the sugar plantation, if not the plan­tation
owner or the manager, who must have paid him his wages or supervised him in his
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What has been sufficiently
established was appellant's flight from Bo. <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> shortly after his commission of the crime, which
indicates a guilty mind (People v. <span class="SpellE">Berganio</span>, L-10121,
December 29, 1960).</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to appellant's story that he and the offended party
lived as husband and wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, we
have only appellant's word for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
rebuttal the offended party's father denied that there was any re­lationship
between his daughter and appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
one - not even appellant's own mother - came to court to give substance to
appellant's statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, a thing
like this would have been known in the barrio by at least a handful of
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is, the only person called
upon to corroborate appellant's allegation - the barrio captain - merely said
that he was of the belief that Leonora and <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>
were friends, and that there were times that he saw <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>
and his (the barrio cap­tain's) nephew in Leonora's house, but that he could
not tell if on those occasions Leonora was also there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, if the alleged cohabitation for
about two months were true, there should have been old or healed lacerations of
the hymen, which Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> could not have failed
to notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, nothing of the sort is
men­tioned in the medical certificate, nor has that fact been testified to by
him in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant has not advanced a single satisfactory reason why the <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> family would fabricate a tale to tie the noose
around his neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, he at­tempted
to give a motive, namely, that Leonora's pa­rents got angry with him for
maintaining intimate relations with their daughter without the benefit of
marriage and later abandoning her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
this were the motive of the <span class="SpellE">Pa­deros</span>, what need would
there be for them to include another person (<span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Perez) in the complaint for rape?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
when appellant finally returned from his alleged sojourn in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Anahawan</span>, the first thing Leonora's parents would
have confronted him with was the subject of marriage, using the complaint which
had already been filed as a sword of Da­mocles hanging above appellant's
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would have given appellant a
chance to redeem their daughter's honor which had been blemished by two months
of extra-marital relation­ship before exposing her honor and dignity to public
contempt to satisfy a feeling of revenge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<u>See</u> People v. <span class="SpellE">Peñafiel</span>,
et al., L-17669, December 30, 1961, 3 SCRA 911.)</span> Besides, if, as
declared by appellant, it was his agreement with Leonora that he would work in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to earn money for their wedding, what reason was there for Leonora to accuse
him of rape?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of evidence as
to an improper motive actuating the offended party and the principal
prosecution witnesses tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper
motive existed and that their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit (People
v. Imam <span class="SpellE">Sawah</span>, et al., L-15333, June 29, 1962, 5 SCRA
385).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant stated that he never went to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Paderos</span> with Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cepeda</span>, another
policeman and the barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Cadac</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, he denied the truth of <span class="SpellE">Flo­rencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Padero's</span> testimony
that sometime after his arrest, appellant, thru Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cepeda</span>,
offered P200.00 to him and to Leonora as a consideration for the dropping of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, appellant's own
witness, <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>,
the barrio captain referred to, declared in court that the group really went to
<span class="SpellE">Padero's</span> house to settle the case, but that <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> did not accede
to any settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The offer of
compromise having been in effect made by appellant, who was then present, the
same constitutes an implied admission of guilt under Sec. 24 of Rule 130.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<u>See</u> People v. <span class="SpellE">Sope</span>, et al., 75 Phil., 810.)</span> While it is true that
in a rape case the rule could be different because said offense may be com­promised
(Art. 344, last paragraph, Revised Penal Code), in this particular instance,
the offer, which was made when the case was already pending in court, was for a
monetary consi­deration and not to marry the offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed by appellant is rape penalized under the
third paragraph of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by
Republic Act No. 4111, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a
deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It was attended by the aggravating circumstances
of nighttime, dwelling and abuse of superior strength, without any mitigating
circumstance to offset them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provision of law quoted above is applied in view of the use by appel­lant of a
deadly weapon, and not because the crime was committed by two or more persons;
hence, abuse of superior strength may be considered as a generic aggravating
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the court below
failed to consider nighttime, which, as can be clearly inferred from the evidence,
was purposely sought to facilitate the commission of the crime, the penalty
imposed by it is nevertheless correct in view of the second paragraph of
Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, which calls for the imposition of the
greater penalty in those cases where the law prescribes a penalty composed of
two indivisible penalties and there is present one aggravating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We notice that no indemnity was awarded in favor of the offended
party, for which reason we make such an award based on Articles 21, 2216, 2219,
2229 and 2230 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
hereby fix the same in the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in view

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a quo</u> directed appellant "to acknowledge
any offspring which Leonora <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> might bear by
reason of the commission of this act." In view of the absence of evidence
in the record to show that the offended party gave birth by reason of the rapes
committed by appellant and his companion, although when the trial began on Sep­tember
16, 1969, the full period for possible gestation from the date of the incident
on March 1, 1968, had already elapsed, we believe that that part of the
judgment should be deleted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment under review is affirmed with the
modifications indicated above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
is according­ly sentenced to the extreme penalty of death and ordered to
indemnify Leonora <span class="SpellE">Padero</span> in the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this decision be furnished the Secre­tary of
Justice for whatever action he may deem necessary and proper in connection with
<span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Perez, who appears to be still at large.</p>
