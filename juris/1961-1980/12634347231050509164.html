intimated that he would file the same case in the court of proper jurisdiction,
a copy of which motion is herein attached as Annex 'A' of this answer and made
an integral part hereof, the question therefore before the Honorable Court
becomes moot and academic;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">and

 14, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the

imprudent act on the part of respondent Samson in filing Civil Case No. </span>C-878
before the court presided by respondent Judge who has no jurisdiction as
admitted by the former, the petitioners have suffered actual damages and
incurred expenses of litigation including attorney's fees and costs, and
praying that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> H. Samson, Jr.
be ordered to pay the petitioners the amounts of P5,000.00 as exemplary and
actual damages; P5,000.00, as and for attorney's fees; and treble costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 4, 1967, the private respondent <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
H. Samson, Jr. filed a rejoinder to the petitioners' Reply stating that the
petitioners' claim for damages contained in their Reply has no basis in law and
in fact; and that the same question of damages arising from the filing of Civil
Case No. C-878 is at issue in an injunction case, Special Civil Action No.
14589 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
entitled:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1967</st1:date>,
the Court granted the petitioners' motion to withdraw the cash bond deposited
for the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition was filed to quash the writ of preliminary
injunction issued on <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1966</st1:date>
in Civil Case No. C-878 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, which restrained Gonzalo B. Mendoza of
<span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City from delivering school equipment to the
Division of Schools of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, and the Division
Superintendent of Schools for <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> from paying
for said items from the funds under his custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts sought to be restrained are
committed or about to be committed in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is already a settled rule that the
jurisdiction or authority of courts of first instance to control or restrain
acts by means of the writ of injunction is limited to acts which are committed
or about to be committed within the territorial boundaries of their respective
provinces and districts.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondent Judge, therefore, had no jurisdiction in Civil Case No. C-878 to
restrain the herein petitioners from performing the acts complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering however, that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> H. Samson, Jr., the plaintiff therein, had
already sought the dismissal of the said case and the consequent <span class="SpellE">quashal</span> of the writ of preliminary injunction issued, the
instant petition is now moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">The application for damages contained in the petitioners' Reply
cannot be entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that a
bond had been filed in Civil Case No. C-878 for the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injunction
bond is intended as a security for damages in case it is finally decided that
the injunction ought not to have been granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is designed to cover all damages which the party enjoined can
possibly suffer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its principal purpose
is to protect the enjoined party against loss or damage by reason of the
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the Rules of Court has
outlined the procedure for the filing of a claim for damages against an
injunction bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 9, Rule 58 of the
Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Judgment to
include damages against party and sureties</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Upon the trial the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff,
or to the defendant, as the case may be, upon the bond of the other party,
shall be claimed, ascertained, and awarded under the same procedure as
prescribed in section 20 of Rule 57."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 20 of Rule 57 reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Claim for
damages on account of illegal attachment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- If the judgment on the action be in favor of the party against whom
attachment was issued, he may recover, upon the bond given or deposit made by
the attaching creditor, any damages resulting from the attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such damages may be awarded only upon application
and after proper hearing, and shall be included in the <span style="">final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application
must be filed before the trial or before appeal is perfected or before the
judgment becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, with due notice to the
attaching creditor and his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing
his right to damages and the amount thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>If the judgment of the appellate court be favorable to the party
against whom the attachment was issued, he must claim damages sustained during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal by filing an application
with notice to the party in whose favor the attachment was issued or his surety
or sureties, before the judgment of the appellate court becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellate court may allow the application to be heard and decided by the trial
court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the provisions of law
cited, it appears that whenever a bond is filed because of the issuance of a
preliminary injunction and damages are suffered as a result thereof, the claim
for damages must be presented in the principal action and judgment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> should be included in the final judgment of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application for such damages
should be filed “before the trial or before appeal is perfected or before the
judgment becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, with due notice to the
(plaintiff) and his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing the
right to damages and the amount thereof."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, it appears that
the private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> H. Samson, Jr., has
filed another case against the herein petitioners with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> </span><span style="">(Special Civil Act No. 14589) and the herein petitioners have
specifically asked therein for damages arising from </span>the issuance of a
writ of preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. C-878 of the Court of First
