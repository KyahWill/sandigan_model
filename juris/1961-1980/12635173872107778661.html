similar facts and the common issue of whether or not <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues are collectible, under sections 2801 and 2802 of Republic Act No. 1937,
commonly known as the Tariff and Customs Code, on goods loaded or unloaded at
private wharves.</p>

<p class="BODY">In L-23359, petitioner Philippine Iron Mines, Inc. protested the
assessment and collection by customs autho­rities of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>

this case, petitioner, aside from in­voking the common ground of the other
petitioners in the two other cases that they had not used government wharves or
facilities, claims that it should be exempted from payment of the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues as a petroleum concessionaire under the
Petroleum Act of 1949, Republic Act No. 387.</p>

<p class="BODY">In L-25400, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> Bay
Lumber Co., Inc. protested the assessment and collection by customs autho­rities
of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues in the total sum of <span style="">P7, </span>945.00 on its twelve shipments of

<span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>, where petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>
Bay Lumber Co., Inc. has its private wharves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals upheld the decision of the Customs
Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, these appeals,
where petitioners seek the reversal of the respective decisions rendered
against them by the Tax Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The common issue in the three cases at bar has already been
resolved in the affirmative by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Procter and Gamble Philippine Manufacturing Corpo­ration vs.
Commissioner of Customs,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
decided on April 27, 1967, this Court, confronted with an identical issue, held
that cargoes of goods unloaded shipside from vessels anchored amidst the safety
of the Port of Manila and discharged at the company's private wharf at <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, were liable for the payment of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues, even though no government wharf or facility
was used to unload the cargoes, under the express provisions of Sec­tion 2802
of the Tariff and Customs Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The imposition of such <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues or
charges was traced back to 1901, when the original Customs Tariff of 1901 was
enacted by the Philippine Commission under authority of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
when the Philippine Government did not have, own or operate a single pier or
wharf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the collection of such <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> charge at the rate of $1 per gross ton on sugar
shipments loaded from a private wharf was protested for the first time after
twenty-six years, this Court, in Philip­pine Sugar Centrals Agency vs.
Collector of Customs,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
upheld the imposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It pointed out
therein that since the first enactment of the Act in 1901, imposing a <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> charge of $0. 75 per gross ton, its reenactment as
an Act of the U.S. Congress in 1905 and the subsequent enactment on August 5,
1909 by the U.S. Congress of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909, imposing such <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> charges at the increased rate of $1 per gross ton,
the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> charge was consistently and continuously
construed by government officials as a proper charge on all goods exported
through Philippine ports, and "that construction has been acquiesced in
and accepted, and the money paid without any protest or objection for
twenty-six years, for many years of which the Government never even owned or
operated a wharf.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court therefore refused to overthrow the long continued construction of
the law as authorizing the collection of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
charges on all shipments, whether through government or private wharves,
considering that the legislature was pre­sumed to be cognizant of such
construction and never evinced its dissent <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court further noted that the funds
derived from such sources were deemed as a trust fund appropriated and used by
the Government for the construc­tion of wharves and the improvement of its harbors.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the 1967 Procter and Gamble case above-cited, this Court noted
that the Philippine Congress enacted Republic Act No. 1371 in 1955, expressly
exempting importations of goods unloaded on private wharves from the cur­rent <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> due of P2 per gross ton; but that the exemp­tion
was again eliminated from Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code upon its
enactment by Congress in 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court rejected the contention that <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues
should be deemed as compensation or rental for the use of govern­ment wharves <span class="GramE">only,</span> and thus stated the reasons and justification for the
imposition of the charges:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A
vessel ordi­narily enters a harbor and lays anchor or moors in a port to load,
to unload or both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In doing so, the
vessel derives benefit from port facilities provided and maintained by the
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, they are in
fairness made to contribute a share in said Government undertaking by payment
of berthing charges and harbor fees.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, cargoes discharged
to a <span style="">Philippine </span>port from a
vessel en­gaged in foreign trade derive benefit from Port facilities provided
and maintained by the Government; said cargoes should also share the cost of
providing and keeping a safe port, in the form of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues. Accordingly, a vessel that anchors at <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> to seek protection from a storm
is not charged <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues by Bureau of Customs, al­though
it may have to pay harbor fees and berthing charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when a vessel anchors at the Bay and
discharges or unloads its cargo, <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are
forthwith collected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as stated,
said dues are assessed against the cargo discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from the provision of the law
under which the assessment is based on the quantity, weight or measure of the
cargo received by the importer and/or discharged by such vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues
on the cargo are distinct from harbor fees or berthing charges on the vessel,
so much so that different sections of the law cover them."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This ruling upholding the imposition of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues on goods loaded or unloaded at private wharves has been reiterated by this
Court in a second Procter and Gamble case against the Customs Commissioner in
1968<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and several other cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In the 1968 Procter and Gamble case, Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
speaking for the Court, further emphasized that "moreover, <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are charged, not for the use of any
wharf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like 'harbor fees, berthing
charges, storage charges and the net income from the share of <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges,' <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fees
are imposed to 'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> form a special fund to be known
as 'Port Works Fund,' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
for the study, investigation, field surveys, research, planning, development,
construction, improvement, maintenance, and repair of ports, ports facilities
and port areas, warehouses, sheds and offices, buoys, lighthouses and other
aides to navigation including the pur­chase, maintenance, rental charges and
replacement of necessary equipment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(As provided in
Act No. 3592, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 130 and Re­public Acts Nos.
1216 and 2695.)"</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find no compelling reason that has been adduced by
petitioners to warrant a modification or setting aside of the doctrine
previously enunciated by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
Inc. in Case L-23679 that it should have been exempted from payment of the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues as a petroleum concessionaire under the
Petroleum Act of 1949 remains for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 103 of the Act, Republic Act 387 provides that "Cus­toms
duties. - During the first five years following the grant­ing of any
concession, the concessionaire may import free of customs duty, all equipment,
machinery, material, instruments, supplies and accessories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> Said pe­titioner contended that since
its five-year exemption period <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> expired on
June 30, 1958 and its four importa­tions of crude oil undisputedly arrived
prior thereto in March and April, 1958, its privilege of exemption from <u>customs
duties</u><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
should include exemption from the <span class="SpellE"><u>wharfage</u></span> <u>dues</u>
in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">A similar contention that exemption as a new and necessary
industry under Republic Act No. 901 included exemp­tion from <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues was rejected by the Court in the 1968 Procter
and Gamble Case (<u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
case, the Court held that both under our Constitution and the Tariff and Cus­toms
Code, <span class="SpellE"><u>wharfage</u></span><u> dues</u> are distinct from
and not consi­dered as part of <u>customs duties</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Our Constitution provides that 'the
Congress x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> may not
deprive the Supreme Court x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
of its jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm on appeal, <i style="">certiorari</i>, or writ of error x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> final judgments and decrees
of inferior courts' in inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, 'all cases
involving the legality of any tax, impost, assess­ment, or toll or any penalty
imposed in relation thereto,' and that 'Congress may by law authorize the
President x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to fix x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> tariff rates, import or
export quotas, and tonnage and <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus our fundamental law distin­guishes
between taxes, on the one hand, and 'imposts' - that is to say, tariff rates or
duties imposed for the importation of goods - on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the Constitution does not consider
'<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues’ as part of 'tariff rates' or customs
duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And neither does our Tariff and
Customs Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cus­toms duties are
governed by Book I, Title I, of said Code, under the headings 'tariff Law' and
'Import Tariff', respectively, whereas <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues
are collectible pursuant to Book II thereof, Title VII of said book, under the
caption 'Fees and Charges Collectible by the Bureau of Customs.' Indeed, said
Code regards customs duties, taxes and <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
charges as three (3) distinct and separate concepts."</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering furthermore that as earlier stated, <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are specifically <span class="SpellE">alloted</span>
by law for the special Port Works Fund and that exemptions are regarded as in
derogation of sovereign authority and of common right and are construed <span class="SpellE"><u>strictissimi</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span>
against the person or entity claiming exemption, the contention of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> that its exemption from <u>customs</u> <u>duties</u>
should be liberally construed to include exemption from <span class="SpellE"><u>wharfage</u></span>
<u>dues</u> must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decisions appealed from are hereby
affirmed, with costs against the respective petitioners.</p>
