				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for prohibition principally to re­strain the respondent
Commission on Elections "from undertaking to hold a plebiscite on November
8, 1971", at which the proposed constitutional amendment "reducing
the voting age" in Section 1 of Article V of the Constitution of the Philippines
to eighteen years "shall be submitted" for ratification by the peo­ple
pursuant to Organic Resolution No. 1 of the Constitutional Convention of 1971,
and the subsequent imple­menting resolutions, by declaring said resolutions to
be without the force and effect of law in so far as they di­rect the holding of
such plebiscite and by also declaring the acts of the respondent Commission
(COMELEC) performed and to be done by it in obedience to the aforesaid Conven­tion
resolutions to be null and void, for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the Constitution of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a preliminary step, since the petition named as respondent
only the COMELEC, the Court required that copies thereof be served on the
Solicitor General and the Constitutional Convention, through its Presi­dent,
for such action as they may deem proper to take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time, respondent COMELEC filed its
answer join­ing issues with petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To further put things in proper order, and considering that the fiscal
officers of the Convention are indispensable parties in a pro­ceeding of this
nature, since the acts sought to be en­joined involve the expenditure of funds
appropriated by law for the Convention, the Court also ordered that the
Disbursing Officer, Chief Accountant and Auditor of the Convention be made respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the petition was so amended, the first
appeared thru Senator Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Pe­laez</span> and the last
two thru Delegate Ramon Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
said respondents, thru counsel, resist petitioner's ac­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">For reasons of orderliness and to avoid unneces­sary duplication
of arguments and even possible confu­sion, and considering that with the
principal parties being duly represented by able counsel, their interests would
be adequately protected already, the Court had to limit the number of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> from the ranks of the delegates to the
Convention who, more or less, have le­gal interest in the success of the
respondents, and so, only Delegates Raul S. <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span>,
Jesus G. Barrera, Pablo S. <span class="SpellE">Trillana</span> III, Victor de la
Serna, Marcelo B. <span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, Jose Y. <span class="SpellE">Feria</span>,
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Siguion</span> Reyna, Victor Ortega and Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Borra</span>, all distinguished lawyers in their own right, have
been allowed to intervene jointly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court feels that with such an array of brilliant and dedicated counsel, all
interests involved should be duly and amply represented and protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, notwithstanding that their
corresponding motions for leave to intervene or to appear as <u>amicus curiae</u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
have been denied, the pleadings filed by the other dele­gates and some private
parties, the latter in represen­tation of their minor children allegedly to be
affected by the result of this case, are with the records and the Court
acknowledges that they have not been without value as materials in the
extensive study that has been undertaken in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are beyond dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Cons­titutional Convention of 1971 came
into being by virtue of two resolutions of the Congress of the Philippines
approved in its capacity as a constituent assembly con­vened for the purpose of
calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution, namely,
Resolutions 2 and 4 of the joint sessions of Congress held on March 16, 1967
and June 17, 1969 respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
delegates to the said Convention were all elected under and by virtue of said
resolutions and the implementing legisla­tion thereof, Republic Act 6132.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions of Resolution No. 2
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
hereby called a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the
Philippines, to be composed of two elective Delegates from each representative
district who shall have the same qualifications as those required of Members of
the House of Representatives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SECTION 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amendments proposed by the Convention shall be valid and considered part of the
Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes cast in an election at
which they are submitted to the people for their ratification pursuant to
Article XV of the Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Resolution No. 4 merely modified the
number of delegates to represent the different cities and provinces fixed
originally in Resolution No. 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the election of the delegates held on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="11">Novem­ber 10, 1970</st1:date>, the Convention held its
inaugural session on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its preliminary labors of election of
officers, organization of committees and other prepara­tory works over, as its
first formal proposal to amend the Constitution, in its session which began on
Septem­ber 27, 1971, or more accurately, at about 3:30 in the morning of
September 28, 1971, the Convention approved Organic Resolution No. 1 reading
thus:</p>

Convention to implement Organic Resolution No. 1, including the creation of the
Ad Hoc Committee and ratifying all acts performed in connection with said
implementation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon these facts, the main thrust of the petition is that Organic
Resolution No. 1 and the other imple­menting resolutions thereof subsequently
approved by the Convention have no force and effect as laws in so far as they
provide for the holding of a plebiscite co­incident with the elections of eight
senators and all city, provincial and municipal officials to be held on
November 8, 1971, hence all of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> acts in obe­dience
thereof and tending to carry out the holding of the plebiscite directed by said
resolutions are null and void, on the ground that the calling and holding of
such a plebiscite is, by the Constitution, a power lodged exclusively in
Congress, as a legislative body, and may not be exercised by the Convention,
and that, under Section 1, Article XV of the Constitution, the proposed
amendment in question cannot be presented to the people for ratification
separately from each and all of the other amendments to be drafted and proposed
by the Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> posit that the power to
provide for, fix the date and lay down the details of the plebiscite for the
ratification of any amendment the Convention may deem pro­per to propose is
within the authority of the Convention as a necessary consequence and part of
its power to propose amendments and that this power includes that of submitting
such amendments either individually or jointly at such time and manner as the
Convention may direct in its discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court's delicate task now is to de­cide which of these two poses is
really in accord with the letter and spirit of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a preliminary and prejudicial matter, the <span class="SpellE">inter­venors</span>
raise the question of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
contend that the issue before Us is a political question and that the
Convention being a legislative body of the highest order is sovereign, and as
such, its acts impugned by petitioner are beyond the control of the Congress
and the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it
is to be noted that none of the respondents has joined <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
in this posture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, respondents
Chief Accountant and Audi­tor of the Convention, expressly concede the
jurisdiction of this Court in their answer acknowledging that the is­sue herein
is a justifiable one.</p>

<p class="BODY">Strangely, <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> cite in support
of this contention portions of the decision of this Court in the case of
Gonzales v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 21 SCRA 774, wherein the members
of the Court, despite their being divided in their opinions as to the other
matters therein involved, were precisely unanimous in upholding its
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, dis­tinguished
counsel have either failed to grasp the full impact of the portions of Our
decision they have quoted or would misapply them by taking them out of context.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should be no more doubt as to the position of this Court
regarding its jurisdiction <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the cons­titutionality
of the acts of the Congress, acting as a constituent assembly, and, for that
matter, those of a constitutional convention called for the purpose of pro­posing
amendments to the Constitution, which concededly is at par with the
former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A simple reading of Our rul­ing
in that very case of <u>Gonzales</u> relied upon by <span class="SpellE">inter­venors</span>
should dispel any lingering misgivings as regards that point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Succinctly but comprehensively, Chief Just­ice
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> held for the Court thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As early as <span class="SpellE">Angara</span> vs. Electoral
Commission (63 Phil. 139, 157), this Court - speaking through one of the
leading members of the Constitutional Convention and a respected professor of
Constitutional Law, Dr. Jose P. Laurel - declared that 'the judicial department
is the only constitutional organ which can be called upon to determine the
proper allocation of powers between the several departments and among the
integral or consti­tuent units thereof.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is true that in <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> v. Lopez
Vito (<u>supra</u>), this Court characterizing the issue submit­ted thereto as
a political one, declined to pass upon the ques­tion whether or not a given num­ber
of votes cast in Congress in favor of a proposed amendment to the Constitution
- which was be­ing submitted to the people for ratification - satisfied the
three-fourths vote requirement of the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The force of this precedent has been
weakened, however, by <span class="SpellE">Suanes</span> v. Chief Accountant of
the Senate (81 Phil. 818) <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, (G.R. No. L-2851, March 4 &amp; 14, 1949) <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, (G.R. No. L-10520,
<st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="2">Feb. 28, 1957</st1:date>) and Macias
v. Commission on Elections (G.R. No. L-18684, Sept. 14, 1961) In the first, we
held that the officers and employees of the Senate Electoral Tribunal are un­der
its supervision and control, not of that of the Senate Presi­dent, as claimed
by the latter; in the second, this Court proceed­ed to determine the number of
Senators necessary for a <u>quorum</u> in the Senate; in the third, we
nullified the election, by Senators belonging to the party having the largest
number of votes in said chamber, purporting to act on be­half of the party
having the se­cond largest number of votes therein, of two (2) Senators
belonging to the first party, as members, for the second party, of the Senate
Electoral Tribunal; and in the fourth, we declared un­constitutional an act of
Congress purporting to apportion the repre­sentative districts for the House of
Representatives, upon the ground that the apportionment had not been made as
may be possible according to the number of inhabitants of each province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus we rejected the theory, advanced in
these four (4) cases, that the issues therein raised were political questions
the determination of which is beyond judicial review.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, the power to amend the Constitution or to propose
amend­ments thereto is not included in the general grant of legislative powers
to Congress (Section 1, Art. VI, Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
It is part of the in­herent powers <u>of the people</u> - as the repository of
sovereignty in a republican state, such as ours (Section 1, Art. II,
Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
- to make, and, hence, to amend their own Fundamen­tal Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress may propose amendments to the
Constitution merely because the same explicitly grants such power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 1, Art. XV, Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
Hence, when exercising the same, it is said that Senators and members of the
House of Represent­atives act, <u>not</u> as members of Con­gress, but as
component elements of a <u>constituent</u> <u>assembly</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When acting as such, the members of Congress
derive their authority from the Constitution, <u>unlike the people</u>, when
performing the same function, (Of amending the Consti­tution) for their
authority does <u>not</u> emanate from the Constitution - they are <u>the very
source</u> of all powers of government, <u>including the Constitution itself</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since, when proposing, as a constituent assembly, amendments
to the Constitution, the members of Congress derive their authority from the
Fundamental Law, it fol­lows, necessarily, that they do not have the final say
on whether or not their acts are within or be­yond constitutional limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other­wise, they could brush aside and set
the same at naught, contrary to the basic tenet that ours is a government of
laws, not of men, and to the rigid nature of our Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such rigidity is stressed by the fact that,
the Constitution expressly confers upon the Supreme Court, (And, in­ferentially,
to lower courts.) the power to declare a treaty un­constitutional, (Sec. 2(1),
Art. VIII of the Constitutional), despite the eminently political character of
treaty-making power.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In short, the issue whether or not a Resolution of Congress -
acting as a constituent assembly - violates the Constitution is essentially
justifiable, not political, and, hence, subject to judicial re­view, and, to
the extent that this view may be inconsistent with the stand taken in <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> v. Lopez Vito, (<u>supra</u>) the latter should be
deemed modified accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Members
of the Court are unanimous on this point."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No one can rightly claim that within the domain of its legitimate
authority, the Convention is not supreme.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in his petition and in his oral ar­gument and memoranda does
petitioner point otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually,
what respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> are seem­ingly
reluctant to admit is that the Constitutional Convention of 1971, as any other
convention of the same nature, owes its existence and derives all its authority
and power from the existing Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Convention has not been called by the
people directly as in the case of a revolution­ary convention which drafts the
first Constitution of an entirely new government born of either a war of
liberation from a mother country or of a re­volution against an existing
government or of a bloodless seizure of power <u>a</u> <u>la</u> <u>coup</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>d'etat</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to
such kind of conventions, it is absolutely true that the convention is
completely without restraint and omnipotent all wise, and it is as to such
conventions that the remarks of Delegate Manuel <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
of the Constitutional Convention of 1934 quoted by Senator <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
refer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No amount of rationalization can
belie the fact that the current convention came into being only because it was
called by a resolution of a joint session of Congress acting as a constituent
as­sembly by authority of Section 1, Article XV of the present Constitution
which provides:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">"ARTICLE XV - AMENDMENTS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Congress in joint session assembled, by a vote of three-fourths of all the
Members of the Senate and of the House of Representative's voting separately,
may propose amendments to this Constitution or call a convention for the
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such amendments shall be valid
as part of this Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes cast at
an election at which the amend­ments are submitted to the people for their
ratification."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">True it is that once convened, this Convention became endowed
with extraordinary powers generally be­yond the control of any department of
the existing government, but the compass of such powers can be co­extensive
only with the purpose for which the conven­tion was called and as it is
self-evident that the amendments it may propose cannot have any effect as part
of the Constitution until the same are duly ratified by the people, it
necessarily follows that the acts of the convention, its officers and members
are not immune from attack on constitutional grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present Constitution is in full force and
effect in its entirety and in everyone of its parts, the existence of the
Convention notwithstanding, and operates even with­in the walls of that
assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is indubitable that
in its internal operation and the performance of its task to propose amendments
to the Constitution it is not subject to any degree of restraint or control by
any other authority than itself, it is equally be­yond cavil that neither the
Convention nor any of its officers or members can rightfully deprive any person
of life, liberty or property without due process of law, deny to anyone in this
country the equal protection of the laws or the freedom of speech and of the
press in disregard of the Bill of Rights of the existing Cons­titution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor, for that matter, can such Convention
validly pass any resolution providing for the taking of private property
without just compensation or for the imposition or exacting of any tax, impost
or assessment, or declare war or call the Congress to a special session,
suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, pardon a convict or render
judgment in a controversy between private individuals or between such
individuals and the state, in violation of the distribution of powers in the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It being manifest that there are powers which the Convention may
not and cannot validly assert, much less exercise, in the light of the existing
Constitu­tion, the simple question arises, should an act of the Convention be
assailed by a citizen as being among those not granted to or inherent in it,
according to the existing Constitution, who can decide whether such a
contention is correct or not?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of
the very es­sence of the rule of law that somehow somewhere the power and duty
to resolve such a grave constitutional question must be lodged on some
authority, or we would have to confess that the integrated system of govern­ment
established by our founding fathers contains a wide vacuum no intelligent man
could ignore, which is naturally unworthy of their learning, experience and
craftsmanship in constitution-making.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need not go far in search for the answer <u>to the</u> query
We have posed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very decision of
Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> in Gonzales, so much invoked
by <span class="SpellE">in­tervenors</span>, reiterates and re-enforces the
irrefutable logic and wealth of principle in the opinion written for a
unanimous Court by Justice Laurel in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Angara</span></st1:place>
vs. Electoral Commission, 63 Phil., 134, reading:</p>

<blockquote>“.... (I)n the main, the Constitution has blocked out with deft
strokes and in bold lines, allotment of power to the executive, the legislative
and the judicial departments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The overlapping and interlacing of func­tions and duties between the
several de­partments, however, sometimes makes it hard to say just where the
one leaves off and the other begins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
times of social disquietude or political excitement, the great landmarks of the
Constitution are apt to be forgotten or marred, if not en­tirely
obliterated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases of conflict, the
judicial department is the only cons­titutional organ which can be called upon
to determine the proper allocation of po­wers between the several departments
and among the integral or constituent units thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As any human production, our Constitution is of course lacking
per­fection and perfectibility, but as much as it was within the power of our
people, acting through their delegates to so pro­vide, that instrument which is
the expres­sion of their sovereignty however limited, has established a
republican government intended to operate and function as a harmo­nious whole,
under a system of checks and balances, and subject to specific limit­ations and
restrictions provided in the said instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution sets forth in no uncertain language the restrictions
and limitations upon govern­mental powers and agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these restrictions and limitations are
trans­cended it would be inconceivable if the Constitution had not provided for
a me­chanism by which to direct the course of government along constitutional
channels, for then the distribution of powers would be mere verbiage, the bill
of rights mere expressions of sentiment, and the principles of good government
mere political apothegms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the
limitations and restrictions embodied in our Constitution are real as they
should be in any living Constitu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
where no express constitutional grant is found in their constitution, the
possession of this moderating power of the courts, not to speak of its
historical origin and development there, has been set at rest by popular
acquiescence for a pe­riod of more than one and a half cen­turies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our case, this moderating power is
granted, if not expressly, by clear implication from section 2 of Article VIII
of our Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Constitution is a defini­tion of the powers or
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who is to determine the
nature, scope and extent of such powers?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitu­tion itself has provided for the ins­trumentality of the
judiciary as the rational way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when
the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not
assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality
nullify or in­validate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn
and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine
conflicting claims of authority under the Consti­tution and to establish for
the par­ties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures
and guarantees to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in truth
all that is involved in what is termed 'judicial supremacy' which pro­perly is
the power of judicial review under the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even then, this power of judicial review is
li­mited to actual cases and controver­sies to be exercised after full oppor­tunity
of argument by the parties, and limited further to the constitutional question
raised or the very <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>mota</u></span>
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any attempt at abstraction
could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to strike
conclusions unrelated to act­ualities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Narrowed as its functions is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass
upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than that, courts accord the presumption
of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only be­cause the
legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the
judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controver­sies must reflect
the wisdom and just­ice of the people as expressed through their
representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But much as we might postulate on the internal checks of
power provided in our Constitution, it ought not the less to be remembered
that, in the language of James Madison, the system itself is not 'the chief
palladium of constitution­al liberty . . . the people who are authors of this
blessing must also be its guardians . . . their eyes must be ever ready to
mark, their voices to pro­nounce . . . aggression on the authori­ty of their
constitution.' In the last and ultimate analysis, then, must the success of our
government in the unfold­ing years to come be tested in the cru­cible of
Filipino minds and hearts than in consultation rooms and court chambers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, the National Assembly has by resolution
(No. 8) of <st1:date year="1935" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1935</st1:date>,
confirmed the election of the herein petitioner to the said body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the Electoral Commission
has by resolution adopted on December 9, 1935, fixed said date as the last day
for the filing of protests against the election, returns and quali­fications of
members of the National As­sembly; notwithstanding the previous confirmations
made by the National As­sembly as aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If, as contended by the petitioner, the resolution of the National
Assembly has the effect of cut­ting off the power of the Electoral Com­mission
to entertain protests against the election, returns and qualifications of
members of the National Assembly, submit­ted after December 3, 1935, then the
resolution of the Electoral Commission of December 9, 1935, is mere <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span> and had no effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, if, as contend­ed by the respondents,
the Electoral Com­mission has the sole power of regulating its proceedings to
the exclusion of the National Assembly, then the resolution of December 9,
1935, by which the Electoral Commission fixed said date as the last day for
filing protests against the election, returns and qualifications of members of
the National Assembly, should be upheld.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Here is then presented an actual con­troversy involving as it
does a conflict of a grave constitutional nature between the National Assembly
on the one hand, and the Electoral Commission on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the very nature of the republican
government established in our country in the light of American experience and
of our own, upon the judicial department is thrown the solemn and inescapable
obligation of interpreting the Constitution and defining constitutional
boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Electoral Commission, as
we shall have occasion to refer hereafter, is a constitutional organ, created
for a speci­fic purpose, namely, to determine all contests relating to the
election, returns and quali­fications of the members of the National
Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the Electoral
Commission may not be interfered with, when and while acting within the limits
of its authority, it does not follow that it is beyond the reach of the
constitutional mechanism adopted by the people and that it is not subject to
constitutional restriction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Electoral Com­mission is not a separate department of the government, and even
if it were, conflicting claims of authority under the fundamental law between
departmental powers and agencies of the government are necessarily determined
by the judiciary in justifiable and appropriate cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discarding the English type and other
European types of constitutional government, the framers of our Constitution
adopted the American type where the written constitution is interpreted and
given effect by the judicial department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In some countries which have de­clined to follow the American example,
provi­sions have been inserted in their constitutions prohibiting the courts
from exercising the power to interpret the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is taken as a recognition of what other­wise
would be the rule that in the ab­sence of direct prohibition, courts are bound
to assume what is logically their function.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For instance, the Constitution of Poland of 1921, expressly provides
that courts shall have no power to examine the validity of statutes (art. 81,
Chap. IV).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former Austrian
Constitution contained a similar declaration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In countries whose constitution are silent in this respect, courts have
assumed this power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is true in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>South Africa</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas, in Czechoslovakia (arts. 2 and 3,
Preliminary Law to Consti­tutional Charter of the Czechoslovak, Republic,
February 29, 1920) and Spain (arts. 121-123, Title IX, Constitution of the Re­public
of 1931) especial constitutional courts are established to pass upon the
validity of ordinary laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our case,
the nature of the present controversy shows the necessity of a final constitu­tional
arbiter to determine the conflict of authority between two agencies created by
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were we to decline to
take cognizance of the controversy, who will determine the conflict?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the conflict were left undecided and
unde­termined, would not a void be thus created in our constitutional system
which may in the long run prove destructive of the entire framework?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To ask these questions is to answer
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Natura</u></span>
<u>vacuum</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>abhorret</u></span>, so must we avoid
exhaustion in our constitu­tional system.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon principle, reason, and authority, we are clearly of the opi­nion
that upon the admitted facts of the present case, this court has jurisdiction
over the Electoral Commission and the sub­ject matter of the present
controversy for the purpose of determining the character, scope and extent of
the constitutional grant to the Electoral Commission as 'the sole judge of all
contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the members of
the National Assembly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the Chief Justice has made it clear in <u>Gon­zales</u>, like
Justice Laurel did in <span class="SpellE"><u>Angara</u></span>, these postulates
just quoted do not apply only to conflicts of authority between the three
existing regular depart­ments of the government but to all such conflicts
between and among these departments, or, between any of them, on the one hand,
and any other constitutionally created independent body, like the electoral
tribunals in Congress, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and the
constituent assemblies constituted by the Houses of Congress, on the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no reason of logic or
principle whatsoever, and none has been convincingly shown to Us by any of the
respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, why the same ruling
should not apply to the present Convention, even if it is an assembly of
delegates elected directly by the people, since at best, as already
demonstrated, it has been con­vened by authority of and under the terms of the
present Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, We are left with no alternative but to uphold the
jurisdiction of the Court over the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It goes without saying that We do this not
because the Court is superior to the Convention or that the Convention is
subject to the control of the Court, but simply because both the Convention and
the Court are subject to the Constitution and the rule of law, and "upon
principle, reason and authority," per Justice Laurel, <u>supra</u>, it is
within the power, as it is the solemn duty of the Court, under the exist­ing
Constitution to resolve the issues in which peti­tioner, respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> have joined in this case.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of jurisdiction thus resolved, We come to the crux of
the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it within the powers of
the Constitutional Convention of 1971 to order, on its own fiat, the holding of
a plebiscite for the ratification of the proposed amendment redu­cing to
eighteen years the age for the exercise of suffrage under Section 1 of Article
V of the Constitution proposed in the Convention's Organic Resolution No. 1 in
the manner and form provided for in said resolution and the subsequent
implementing acts and resolution of the Convention?</p>

<p class="BODY">At the threshold, the environmental circumstances of this case
demand the most accurate and unequivocal statement of the real issue which the
Court is called upon to resolve.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has very clearly stated that he is not against the
constitutional extension of the right of suffrage to the eighteen-year-olds, as
a matter of fact, he has advocated or sponsored in Congress such a proposal,
and that, in truth, the herein petition is not intended by him to prevent that
the proposed amendment here involved be submitted to the people for
ratification, his only purpose in filing the petition being to comply with his
sworn duty to prevent, whenever he can, any violation of the Constitution of
the Philippines even if it is committed in the course of or in con­nection with
the most laudable undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
as the Court sees it, the specific question raised in this case is limited
solely and only to the point of whether or not it is within the power of the
Convention to call for a plebiscite for the ratification by the people of the
constitutional amendment proposed in the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>
Organic Resolution No. 1, in the manner and form provided in said resolution as
well as in the subsequent implementing actions and resolution of the Convention
and its officers, at this juncture of its proceedings, when, as it is a matter
of common knowledge and judicial notice, it is not set to adjourn <u>sine die</u>,
and is, in fact, still in the preliminary stages of considering other reforms
or amendments affecting other parts of the existing Constitution; and, indeed,
Organic Resolution No. 1 itself expressly provides that the amendment therein
proposed "shall be without prejudice to other amendments that will be
proposed in the future by the 1971 Constitutional Convention on other portions
of the amended section or on other portions of the entire Constitution."
In other words, nothing that the Court may say or do in this case should be
understood as reflecting, in any degree or means, the indivi­dual or collective
stand of the members of the Court on the funda­mental issue of whether or not
the eighteen-year-olds should be allowed to vote, simply because that issue is
not before Us now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be no
doubt in the mind of anyone that, once the Court finds it constitutionally
permissible, it will not hesitate to do its part so that the said proposed
amendment may be presented to the people for their approval or rejection.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, the Court rests securely in the conviction that the fire
and enthusiasm of the youth have not blinded them to the abso­lute necessity,
under the fundamental principles of democracy to which the Filipino people is
committed, of adhering always to the rule of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, their idealism, sincerity and purity
of pur­pose cannot permit any other line of conduct or approach in res­pect of
the problem before Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Constitutional Convention of 1971 itself was born, in a great measure, because
of the pres­sure brought to bear upon the Congress of the Philippines by var­ious
elements of the people, the youth in particular, in their in­cessant search for
a peaceful and orderly means of bringing about meaningful changes in the
structure and bases of the existing social and governmental institutions,
including the provisions of the fundamental law related to the well-being and
economic security of the under­privileged classes of our people as well as
those concerning the preservation and protection of our natural resources and
the national patrimony, as an alternative to violent and chaotic ways of
achieving such lofty ideals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief,
leaving aside the excesses of enthusiasm which at times have justifiably or
unjustifiably marred the demons­trations in the streets, plazas and campuses,
the youth of the Philippines, in general, like the rest of the people, do not
want confusion and disorder, anarchy and violence; what they really want are
law and order, peace and orderliness, even in the pur­suit of what they
strongly and urgently feel must be done to change the present order of things
in this Republic of ours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be
tragic and con­trary to the plain compulsion of these perspectives, if the
Court were to allow itself in deciding this case to be carried astray by considerations
other than the imperatives of the rule of law and of the applicable provisions
of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Need­less to say,
in a larger measure than when it binds other departments of the government or
any other official or entity, the Constitution imposes upon the Court the
sacred duty to give meaning and vigor to the Constitution, by interpreting and
constru­ing its provisions in appropriate cases with the proper parties and by
striking down any act <span class="SpellE">viola­tive</span> thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, as in all other cases, We are resolved
to discharge that duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">During these times when most anyone feels very strongly the
urgent need for constitutional reforms, to the point of being convinced that
meaningful change is the only alternative to a violent revolution, this Court
would be the last to put any obstruction or impediment to the work of the
Constitutional Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there are
respectable sectors opining that it has not been called to supplant the
existing Constitution in its entirety, since its enabling provision, Arti­cle
XV, from which the Convention itself draws life expressly speaks only of
amendments which shall form part of it, which opinion is not with­out
persuasive force both in principle and in logic, the seemingly prevailing view
is that only the collective judgment of its members as to what is warranted by
the present con­dition of things, as they see it, can limit the extent of the
constitutional innovations the Convention may propose, hence the com­plete
substitution of the existing consti­tution is not beyond the ambit of the
Convention's authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Desirable as it
may be to resolve this grave divergence of views, the Court does not consider
this case to be properly the one in which it should discharge its constitutional
duty in such premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issues raised
by petitioner, even those among them in which respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> have joined in an apparent wish to have them
squarely passed upon by the Court do not necessarily impose upon Us the
imperative obligation to express Our views thereon. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The Court considers it to be of the utmost
impor­tance that the Convention should be <span class="SpellE">untram­melled</span>
and unrestrained in the performance of its constitutionally assigned mission in
the manner and form it may conceive best, and so the Court may step in to clear
up doubts as to the boundaries set down by the Constitution only when and to
the specific extent only that it would be ne­cessary to do so to avoid a
constitutional crisis or a clearly demonstrable violation of the existing
Charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, it is a very familiar
principle of constitutional law that constitutional questions are to be
resolved by the Supreme Court only when there is no alternative but to do it,
and this rule is founded precisely on the principle of respect that the Court
must accord to the acts of the other co­ordinate departments of the government,
and certainly, the Constitutional Convention stands almost in a unique footing
in that regard.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our discussion of the issue of jurisdiction, We have already
made it clear that the Convention came into being by a call of a joint session
of Congress pursuant to Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution, already
quoted earlier in this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
reiterate also that as to matters not related to its internal operation and the
per­formance of its assigned mission to propose amendments to the Constitution,
the Convention and its officers and members are all sub­ject to all the
provisions of the existing Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now We hold that even as to its latter task of proposing amendments to
the Constitution, it is subject to the provisions of Section 1 of Article
XV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so, because it is plain
to Us that the framers of the Constitution took care that the process of
amending the same should not be undertaken with the same ease and facility in
changing an ordinary legislation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Constitution making is the most valued power, second to none, of the
people in a constitutional democracy such as the one our founding fathers have
chosen for this nation, and which we of the succeeding generations generally
cherish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because the Constitution
affects the lives, fortunes, future and every other conceivable aspect of the
lives of all the people within the country and those subject to its
sovereignty, every degree of care is taken in preparing and drafting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A constitution worthy of the people for which
it is intended must not be prepared in haste without adequate deliberation and
study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that
correspondingly, any amendment of the Constitution is of no less importance
than the whole Constitution itself, and perforce must be conceived and pre­pared
with as much care and deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the very nature of things, the drafters of an original constitution, as already
observed earlier, operate without any limitations, restraints or inhibitions
save those that they may impose upon themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not necessarily true of subsequent
conventions called to amend the original constitu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally, the framers of the latter see to
it that their handiwork is not lightly treated and as easily mutilated or
changed, not only for reasons purely personal but more importantly, because
written consti­tutions are supposed to be designed so as to last for some time,
if not for ages, or for, at least, as long as they can be adopted to the needs
and exigencies of the people, hence, they must be insulated against precipitate
and hasty actions motivated by more or less passing political moods or
fancies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as a rule, the original
constitutions carry with them limitations and conditions, more or less
stringent, made so by the people themselves, in regard to the process of their
amend­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when such limitations or
conditions are so incorporated in the original constitution, it does not lie in
the delegates of any subsequent convention to claim that they may ignore and
disregard such conditions because they are as powerful and omnipotent as their
original counterparts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing of what is here said is to be understood as curtailing in
any degree the number and nature and the scope and extent of the amendments the
Convention may deem proper to propose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor does the Court propose to pass on the issue extensively and
brilliantly discussed by the parties as to whether or not the power or duty to
call a plebiscite for the ratification of the amendments to be proposed by the
Convention is exclusively legislative and as such may be exercised only by the
Congress or whether the said power can be exercised concurrently by the
Convention with the Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
view the Court takes of the present case, it does not perceive absolute
necessity to resolve that question, grave and important as it may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, the lack of unanimity or even
of a consensus among the members of the Court in respect to this issue creates
the need for more study and deliberation, and as time is of the essence in this
case, for obvious reasons, November 8, 1971, the date set by the Convention for
the plebiscite it is calling, being nigh, We will refrain from making any
pronouncement or expressing Our views on this question until a more appropriate
case comes to Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the basis
of this decision is as important and decisive as any can be.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ultimate question, therefore, boils down to this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is there any limitation or condition in
Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitu­tion which is violated by the act of
the Convention of calling for a plebiscite on the sole amendment contained in
Organic Resolution No. 1?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
holds that there is, and it is the condition and limitation that all the
amendments to be proposed by the same Conven­tion must be submitted to the
people in a single "election" or plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being indisputable that the amendment now
proposed to be submitted to a plebiscite is only the first amendment the
Convention will propose We hold that the plebiscite being called for the
purpose of submitting the same for ratification of the people on November 8,
1971 is not au­thorized by Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution, hence
all acts of the Convention and the respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
in that direction are null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have arrived at this conclusion for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The language of the constitutional provision <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> is sufficiently clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It says distinctly that either Congress
sitting as a constituent assembly or a convention called for the purpose
"may propose amendments to this Constitution," thus placing no limit
as to the number of amendments that Congress or the Convention may
propose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same provision also as
definitely provides that "such <u>amendments</u> shall be valid as part of
this Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes cast at <u>an
election</u> at which the <u>amendments</u> are submitted to the people for
their ratification," thus leaving no room for doubt as to how many
"elections" or plebiscites may be held to ratify any amendment or
amendments proposed by the same constituent assembly of Congress or convention,
and the provision unequivocally says "an election" which means only
one.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very little reflection is needed for anyone to
realize the wisdom and appropriateness of this provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, amending the Constitution
is as serious and important an undertak­ing as constitution making itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, any amendment of the Constitution is
as important as the whole of it, if only because the Constitution has to be an
integrated and harmonious instrument, if it is to be viable as the framework of
the government it establishes, on the one hand, and adequately formidable and
reliable as the suc­cinct but comprehensive articulation of the rights,
liberties, ideo­logy, social ideals, and national and nationalistic policies
and aspi­rations of the people, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is inconceivable how a con­stitution worthy of any country or people
can have any part which is out of tune with its other parts.</p>

<p class="BODY">A constitution is the work of the people thru its drafters as­sembled
by them for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the
original constitution is approved, the part that the people play in its
amendment becomes harder, for when a whole constitution is submitted to them,
more or less they can assume its harmony as an integrated whole, and they can
either accept or reject it in its entirety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the very least, they can examine it before casting their vote and
determine for the selves from a study of the whole document the merits and
demerits of all or any of its parts and of the document as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so also, when an amendment is submitted
to them that is to form part of the existing constitution, in like fashion they
can study with deli­beration the proposed amendment in relation to the whole
existing constitution and or any of its parts and thereby arrive at an
intelligent judgment as to its acceptability.</p>

<p class="BODY">This cannot happen in the case of the amendment in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> already
from the fact that under Section 3 of the ques­tioned resolution, it is evident
that no fixed frame of reference is provided the voter, as to what finally will
be the concomitant quali­fications that will be required by the final draft of
the constitution to be formulated by the Convention of a voter to be able to
enjoy the right of suffrage, there are other considerations which make it
impossible to vote intelligently on the proposed amendment, although it may
already be observed that under Section 3, if a voter would favor the reduction
of the voting age to eighteen under conditions he feels are needed under the
circumstances, and he does not see those conditions in the ballot nor is there
any possible indication whether they will ever be or not, because Congress has
reserved those for future action, what kind of judgment can he render on the
proposal?</p>

<p class="BODY">But the situation actually before Us is even worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one knows what changes in the fundamental
principles of the constitu­tion the Convention will be minded to approve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more speci­fic, we do not have any
means of foreseeing whether the right to vote would be of any significant value
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who can say whether or not later
on the Convention may decide to provide for varying types of voters for each level
of the political units it may divide the country into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The root of the difficulty, in other words,
lies in that the Convention is precisely on the verge of introducing sub­stantial
changes, if not radical ones, in almost every part and aspect of the existing
social and political order enshrined in the present Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can a voter in the proposed plebiscite
intelligently determine the effect of the reduction of the voting age upon the
different institutions which the Convention may establish and of which
presently he is not given any idea?</p>

<p class="BODY">We are certain no one can deny that in order that a plebiscite
for the ratification of an amendment to the Constitution may be validly held,
it must provide the voter not only sufficient time but ample basis for an
intelligent appraisal of the nature of the amend­ment <u>per</u> <u>se</u> as
well as its relation to the other parts of the Consti­tution with which it has
to form a harmonious whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
context of the present state of things, where the Convention has hardly started
considering the merits of hundreds, if not thousands, of proposals to amend the
existing Constitution, to present to the people any single proposal or a few of
them cannot comply with this requirement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are of the opinion that the present Constitution does not contemplate
in Section 1 of Article XV a plebiscite or "election" wherein the
people are in the dark as to frame of reference they can base their judgment
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reject the rationalization that
the present Constitu­tion is a possible frame of reference, for the simple
reason that <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> themselves are stating that
the sole purpose of the pro­posed amendment is to enable the eighteen year olds
to take part in the election for the ratification of the Constitution to be
drafted by the Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief,
under the proposed plebiscite, there can be, in the language of Justice
Sanchez, speaking for the six members of the Court in Gonzales, <u>supra</u>,
"no proper submission".</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has no desire at all to hamper and hamstring the noble
work of the Constitutional Convention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Much less does the Court want to pass judgment on the merits of the
proposal to allow these eighteen years old to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But like the Convention, the Court has its
own duties to the people under the Constitution, which is to decide in
appropriate cases with appropriate parties whether or not the mandates of the
fundamental law are being complied with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the best light God has given Us, We are of the conviction that in
providing for the questioned plebiscite before it has finished, and separately
from, the whole draft of the constitution it has been called to formulate, the
Convention's Organic Resolution No. 1 and all subsequent acts of the Convention
implementing the same violate the condition in Section 1, Article XV that there
should only be one "election" or plebiscite for the ratification of
all the amendments the Convention may propose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not denying any right of the people to vote on the proposed
amendment; We are only holding that under Section 1, Article XV of the
Constitution, the same should be submitted to them not separately from but
together with all the other amendments to be proposed by this present
Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition herein is
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Organic Resolution No. 1 of the
Constitutional Convention of 1971 and the implementing acts and resolutions of
the Convention, insofar as they provide for the holding of a plebiscite on <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1971</st1:date>, as well as the
resolution of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> complying

Disbursing Officer, Chief Ac­countant and Auditor of the Constitutional
Convention are hereby enjoined from taking any action in compliance with the
said organic resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">There is much to be said for the opinion of the Court penned by
Justice Barredo, characterized by clarity and vigor, its mani­festation of fealty
to the rule of law couched in eloquent language, that commands assent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Constitution occupies the topmost rank
in the hierarchy of legal norms, Congress and Constitutional Convention alike,
no less than this Court, must bow to its supremacy. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thereby constitutionalism asserts itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the view I entertain of what is
allowable, if not indeed required by the Constitution, my conformity does not
extend as far as the acceptance of the conclusion reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question presented is indeed novel, not
being controlled by constitutional prescription, definite and certain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, with the express
recognition in the Constitution of the powers of the Constitutional Convention
to propose amendments, I cannot discern any objection to the validity of its
action, there being no legal impediment that would call for its
nullification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an approach all the
more commends itself to me considering that what was sought to be done is to
refer the matter to the people in whom, according to our Cons­titution,
sovereignty resides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in that sense
that, with due respect, I find myself unable to join my brethren.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable then
why the decisive issue posed could not be resolved by reliance on, implicit in
the petition and the answer of intervenors, such concepts as legislative
control of the constitutional convention referred to by petitioner on the one
hand or, on the other, the theory of conventional sovereignty favored by
intervenors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is gratifying to note
that during the oral argument of petitioner and counsel for respondents and
intervenors, there apparently was a retreat from such extreme position, all
parties, as should be the case, expressly avowing the primacy of the
Constitution, the applicable provision of which, as interpreted by this Court,
should be controlling on both Congress and the Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied though that in at least
one American state, that is Pennsylvania, there were decisions announcing the
doctrine that the powers to be exercised by a constitutional convention are
dependent on a legislative grant, in the absence of any authority conferred
directly by the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
result is a convention that is subordinate to the lawmaking body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its field of competence is
circumscribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has to took to the
latter for the delimitation of its permissible scope of activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus made subordinate to the
legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere has such a view
been more vigorously expressed than in the Pennsylvania case of Wood's Appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Its holding though finds no support under our constitutional provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not thereby follow that while free from legislative
control, a constitutional convention may lay claim to an attribute sovereign in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution is quite
explicit that it is to the people, and to the people alone, in whom sovereignty
resides.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a prerogative is therefore withheld from a convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an agency entrusted with the
responsibility of high import and significance, it is true; it is denied
unlimited legal competence though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
is what sovereignty connotes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has to
yield to the superior force of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can then be no basis for the
exaggerated pretension that it is an <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u> of the
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be admitted that there
are some American state decisions, the most notable of which is Sproule v.
Fredericks,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> a
Mississippi case, that dates back to 1892, that yield a different
conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine therein
announced cannot bind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
Constitution makes clear that the power of a constitutional convention is not
sovereign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is appropriately termed
constituent, limited as it is to the purpose of drafting a constitution or
proposing revision or amendments to one in existence, subject in either case to
popular approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">The view that commends itself for acceptance is that legis­lature
and constitutional convention, alike recognized by the Constitution, are
coordinate, there being no superiority of one over the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the constituent power of proposing
amendments to the Constitution is concerned, a constitutional convention enjoys
a wide sphere of autonomy consistently with the Constitution which can be the
only source of valid restriction on its competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true it is to the legislative body that
the call to a convention must proceed, but once convened, it cannot in any wise
be interfered with, much less controlled by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary conclusion would impair its
usefulness for the delicate and paramount task assigned to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A convention then is to be looked upon as if
it were one of the three coordinate departments which under the principle of
separation of powers is supreme within its field and has exclusive cognizance
of matters properly subject to its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A succinct statement of the appropriate principle
that should govern the relationship between a consti­tutional convention and a
legislative body under American law is that found in Orfield's work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The earliest view seems to have been that a convention was
absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The convention was sovereign
and subject to no restraint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, Jameson, whose views have been most frequently cited in decisions,
viewed a convention as a body with strictly limited powers, and subject to the
restrictions imposed on it by the legislative call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A third and intermediate view is that urged
by Dodd - that a convention, though not sovereign, is a body independent of the
legislature; it is bound by the existing constitution, but not by the acts of
the legislature, as to the extent of its constituent power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view has become increasingly prevalent
in the state decisions."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to the
Constitution, and to the Constitution alone then, as so vigorously stressed in
the opinion of the Court, that any limitation on the power the Constitutional
Convention must find its source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turn
to its Article XV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Congress in joint session
assembled, by a vote of three-fourths of all the Members of the Senate and of
the House of Representatives voting separately, may propose amendments to this
Constitution or call a convention for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such amendments shall be valid as part of
this Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes cast at an election
at which the amendments are submitted to the people for their
ratification."</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, insofar as amendments, including revision, are
concerned, there are two steps, proposal and thereafter ratifi­cation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus as to the former, two constituent bodies
are provided for, the Congress of the Philippines, in the mode there­in
provided, and a constitutional convention that may be called into being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once assembled, a constitutional convention,
like the Congress of the Philippines, possesses in all its plenitude the
constituent power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as Congress
may determine what amendments it would have the people ratify and thereafter
take all the steps necessary so that the approval or disapproval of the
electorate may be obtained, the convention likewise, to my mind, should be
deemed possessed of all the necessary authority to assure that whatever amendments
it seeks to introduce would be submitted to the people at an election called
for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear to me
that to view the convention as being denied a prerogative which is not withheld
from Congress as a constituent body would be to place it in an inferior
category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a pro­position I do not
find acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress and
constitutional convention are agencies for submitting proposals under the funda­mental
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A power granted to one should not
be denied the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No justification
for such a drastic differentiation either in theory or practice exists.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a conclusion has for me the added reinforcement that to
require ordinary legislation before the convention could be enabled to have its
proposals voted on by the people would be to place a power in the legislative
and executive branches that could, whether by act or omission, result in the
frustration of the amend­ing process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
am the first to admit that such a likelihood is remote, but if such a risk,
even if minimal could be avoided, it should be, unless the compelling force of
an applicable consti­tutional provision requires otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that a constitutional convention
is not precluded from imposing additional restrictions on the powers of either
the executive or legislative branches, or, for that matter, the judiciary, it
would appear to be the better policy to interpret Article XV in such a way that
would not sanction such restraint on the authority that must be recognized as
vested in a constitutional convention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in such a view that to my mind would collide with a
reasonable interpretation of Article XV.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It certainly is one way by which freed from pernicious abstractions, it
would be easier to accommodate a constitution to the needs of an unfolding
future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to facilitate its being
responsive to the challenge that time inevitably brings in its wake.</p>

<p class="BODY">From such an approach then, I am irresistibly led to the
conclusion that the challenged resolution was well within the power of the
convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be to brush aside
the web of unreality spun from a too-restrictive mode of appraising the
legitimate scope of its competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
would be, for me, to give added vigor and life to the conferment of authority
vested in it, attended by such grave and awesome responsibility.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It becomes pertinent to
inquire then whether the last sentence of Article XV providing that such
amendment shall be valid when submitted and thereafter approved by the majority
of the votes cast by the people at an election is a bar to the proposed
submission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the conclusion arrived
at by my brethren that there is to be only one election and that therefore the
petition must be sustained as only when the convention has finished its work
should all amendments proposed be submitted for ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not for me, and I say this with
respect, the appropriate interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that the Constitution uses the word "election" in
the singular, but that is not decisive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No undue reliance should be accorded rules of grammar; they do not exert
a compelling force in constitutional interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meaning is to be sought not from specific
language in the singular but from the mosaic of significance derived from the
total context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be, if it were
not thus, self-defeating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a mode of
construction does not commend itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The words used in the Constitution are not inert; they derive vitality
from the obvious purposes at which they are aimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's stress on linguistic refinement,
while not implausible does not, for me, carry the day.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was likewise argued by petitioner that the proposed amendment
is provisional and therefore is not such as was contemplated in this
article.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not find such contention
convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the Constitutional
Convention did seek to consult the wishes of the people by the proposed
submission of a tentative amendatory provision is an argument for its
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might be said of course
that until impressed with finality, an amendment is not to be passed upon by
the electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is plausibility in
such a view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A literal reading of the
Constitution would support it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
spirit that informs it though would not, for me, be satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From its silence I deduce the inference that
there is no repugnancy to the fundamental law when the Constitutional
Convention ascertains the popular will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that sense, the Constitution, to follow the phraseology of Thomas
Reed Powell, is not silently silent but silently vocal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I deem the more important consideration
is that while a public official, as an agent, has to locate his source of
authority in either Constitution or statute, the people, as the principal, can
only be limited in the exercise of their sovereign powers by the express terms
of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A concept to the
contrary would to my way of thinking be in­consistent with the fundamental
principle that it is in the people, and the people alone, that sovereignty
resides.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitutional
Convention having acted within the scope of its authority, an action to
restrain or prohibit respondent Commission on Elections from conducting the
plebiscite does not lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not
be lost sight of that the Commission on Elections in thus being charged with
such a duty does not act in its capacity as the constitutional agency to take
charge of all laws relative to the conduct of election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a purely executive function vested in
it under Article X of the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not precluded from assisting the Constitutional Convention if pursuant to
its competence to amend the fundamental law, it seeks, as in this case, to
submit a proposal, even if admittedly tentative, to the electorate to ascertain
its verdict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it may be
implied that under the 1971 Constitutional Convention Act, it is not to turn a
deaf ear to a summons from the Convention to aid it in the legitimate discharge
of its functions.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid considerations, such as they are, but which for me
have a force that I find myself unable to overcome, leave me no alternative but
to dissent from my brethren, with due acknowledge­ment of course that from
their basic premises, the conclusion arrived at by them cannot be characterized
as in any wise bereft of a persuasive quality of a high order.</p>

Wood's Appeal, 75 Pa. 59 (1874) cited in Malcolm and Laurel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cases in Constitutional Law, pp. 1, 4-5
(1936).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was therein stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In a governmental and proper sense, <u>law</u>
is the highest act of a people's sovereignty, while their government and
Constitution remain un­changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the supreme will of the people expressed in the forms and by the authority of
their Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is their own
appointed mode through which they govern themselves, and by which they bind
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long as their frame of
government is unchanged in its grant of all legislative power, these laws are
supreme over all subjects unforbidden by the instrument itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The calling of a convention, and regulating
its action by law, is not for­bidden in the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a conceded <u>manner</u>, through which
the people may exercise the rights reserved in the bill of rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * The right of the people to restrain
their delegates by <u>law</u> cannot be denied, unless the power to call a
convention by law, and the right of self-protection be also denied."</p>

11 So. 472.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following excerpt
appears in the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We have
spoken of the constitutional con­vention as a sovereign body, and that
characterization perfectly defines the correct view, in our opinion, of the
real nature of that august assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is the highest legislative body known to freemen in a repre­sentative
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is supreme in its
sphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wields the powers of sovereignty,
specially dele­gated to it, for the purpose and the occasion, by the whole
electoral body, for the good of the whole commonwealth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sole limitation upon its powers is that
no change in the form of government shall be done or attempted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spirit of republicanism must breathe
through every part of the framework, but the particular fashioning of the parts
of this framework is confided to the wisdom, the faithfulness, and the
patriotism of this great convocation, representing the people in their
sovereignty." The Sproule decision was cited with approval four years
later by the Mississippi Supreme Court anew in Dickson <i>v.</i> State, 20 So.

<p class="OTHERHEADING">RESERVATION OF VOTE</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKALINTAL, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I reserve my vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
resolution in question is voted down by a sufficient majority of the Court on
just one ground, which to be sure achieves the result from the legal and
constitutional view point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I entertain
grave doubts as to the validity of the premises postulated and conclusions
reached in support of the dispositive portion of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, considering the urgent nature of
this case, the lack of time to set down at length my opinion on the particular
issue upon which the decision is made to rest, and the fact that a dissent on
the said issue would necessarily be inconclusive unless the other issues raised
in the petition are also considered and ruled upon - a task that would be
premature and pointless at this time - I limit myself to this reservation.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REYES, J.B.L., ZALDIVAR, CASTRO, and MAKASIAR, <i>JJ.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">We concur in the main opinion penned by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in his usual inimitable forthright and vigorous
style.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like him, we do not express our
individual views on the <u>wisdom</u> of the proposed constitutional amendment,
which is not in issue here because it is a matter that properly and exclusively
addresses itself to the collective judgment of the people.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must, however, articulate two additional objections of cons­titutional
dimension which, although they would seem to be superfluous because of the
reach of the basic constitutional infirmity discussed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span> in the main opinion, nevertheless appear to
us to be just as fundamental in character and scope.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the Constitutional Convention has power to propose
piecemeal amendments and submit each separately to the people for ratification,
we are nonetheless persuaded that (1) that there is no <u>proper submission</u>
of the proposed amendment in question within the meaning and intendment of
Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution, and (2) that the forthcoming
election is <u>not</u> the <u>proper election</u> envi­sioned by the same
provision of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Justice C.V. Sanchez, in his dissent in <u>Gonzales vs. Com­mission
on Elections</u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and <u>Philippine Constitution Association vs. Commission on Elections</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
expounded his view, with which we essentially agree, on the minimum
requirements that must be met in order that there can be a <u>proper submission</u>
to the people of a proposed constitutional amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what he said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
amendments must be fairly laid before the people for their blessing or
spurning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people are not to be mere
rubber stamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not to vote
blindly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must be afforded ample
opportunity to mull over the original pro­visions, compare them with the
proposed amendments, and try to reach a conclusion as the dictates of their
conscience suggest, free from the incubus of extraneous or possibly insidious
influences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe the word
'submitted' can only mean that the government, within its maximum capabilities,
should strain every effort to inform ever citizen of the provisions to be
amended, and the proposed amend­ments and the meaning, nature and effects
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this, we are not to be understood
as saying that, if one citizen or 100 citizens or 1,000 citizens cannot be
reached, then there is no submission within the meaning of the word as intended
by the framers of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
the Constitution in effect directs is that the government, in submitting an
amendment for ratification, should put every ins­trumentality or agency within
its structural frame­work to enlighten the people, educate them with respect to
their act of ratification or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For as we have earlier stated, one thing is <u>sub</u>­<u>mission</u>
and another is <u>ratification</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There must be fair submission, intelligent consent or rejec­tion.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second constitutional objection was given expression by one
of the writers<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of this concurring opinion, in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>"I find it impossible to believe that it was ever intended by
its framers that such amend­ment should be submitted and ratified by just 'a
majority of the votes cast at an election at which the amendments are submitted
to the people for their ratification', if the concentration of the people's
attention thereon is to be diverted by other extraneous issues, such as the
choice of local and national officials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The framers of the Constitution, aware of the fundamental character
thereof, and of the need of giving it as much stability as is practicable,
could have only meant that any amendments thereto should be debated, considered
and voted upon at an election wherein the people could devote undivided
attention to the subject."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">True it is that the question posed by the proposed amendment,
"Do you or do you not want the 18-year old to be allowed to vote?,"
would seem to be uncomplicated and innocuous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is one of life's verities that things which appear to be simple
may turn out not to be so simple after all.</p>

<p class="BODY">A number of doubts or misgivings could conceivably and logic­ally
assail the average voter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why should the
voting age be lowered at all, in the first place?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why should the new voting age be pre­cisely
18 years, and not 19 or 20?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And why not
17?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or even 16 or 15?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the 18-year old as mature as the 21-year
old so that there is no need of an educational qualification to entitle him to
vote?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this age of permissiveness and
dissent, can the 18-year old be relied upon to vote with judiciousness when the
21-year old, in the past elections, has not performed so well?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the proposed amendment is voted down by
the people, will the Constitutional Convention insist on the said
amendment?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why is there an unseemly
haste on the part of the Constitutional Convention in having this particular
proposed amendment ratified at this particular time?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do some of the mem­bers of the Convention
have future political plans which they want to begin to <span class="SpellE">subserve</span>
by the approval this year of this amendment?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If this amendment is approved, does it thereby mean that the 18?year
old should now also shoulder the moral and legal responsibilities of the
21-year old?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will he be required to
render compulsory military service under the colors?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will the age of contractual consent be reduced
to 18 years?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I vote against this
amendment, will I not be unfair to my own child who will be 18 years old, come
1973?</p>

<p class="BODY">The above are just samplings from here, there and every­where --
from a domain (of searching questions) the bounds of which are not immediately
ascertainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, many more
questions can be added to the already long litany.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the answers cannot be had except as the
questions are debated fully, pondered upon pur­posefully, and accorded
undivided attention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Scanning the contemporary scene, we say that the people are not,
and by election time will not be, sufficiently informed of the meaning, nature
and effects of the proposed constitutional amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have not been afforded ample time to
deliberate thereon conscientiously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
have been and are effectively dis­tracted from a full and dispassionate
consideration of the merits and demerits of the proposed amendment by their
traditional per­vasive involvement in local elections and politics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot thus weigh in tranquility the
need for and the wisdom of the pro­posed amendment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the above disquisition, it is our considered view that the
intendment of the words, "at an election at which the amend­ments are
submitted to the people for their ratification," embodied in Section 1 of
Article XV of the Constitution, has not been met.</p>
