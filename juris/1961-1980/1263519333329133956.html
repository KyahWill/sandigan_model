accused in Criminal Case No. 1477 guilty of the crime of rape and sentencing
each of them to life imprisonment, to indemnify the offended party and to pay
the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that based on a complaint duly executed by <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> V. Reyes before the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, the Provincial Fiscal filed an information in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
accusing Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>, Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, alias
Boy, of the crime of rape, allegedly committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 6th day of August 1966, in the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>, pro­vince of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, Philippines, and
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Carlos
<span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>, Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>, and
<span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, alias Boy,
conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another thru force, threat
and intimidation, did then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously and with deliberate intent and lewd designs, attack
and have carnal knowledge with one <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Reyes,
against her will and without the consent of the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That in the commission of the crime the aggravating
circumstances of superior strength and in an uninhabited place and nighttime
are present."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On arraignment, the three accused entered
pleas of not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">To establish its case, the prosecution presented the following
witnesses:</p>

<p class="BODY">DR. BENIGNO RIVERA, Jr., resident physician in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
who conducted the physical examina­tion on the person of the complainant a few
hours after the alleged rape was committed, affirmed on the witness stand the
findings contained in the medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that the contusions
found in the vulva and fresh laceration at the posterior <span class="SpellE">fourchette</span>
of the complainant's genital organ could have been caused by some force
inflicted on the said parts of the body by a hard object.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant MINDA V. REYES testified that in the evening of
August 5, 1966, she attended the coronation ceremony held at the St. Mary's
College in <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> where she was then a 4th year BSE
student.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affair ended at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time> in the evening, and she left the school
with her boy friend, <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>,
at past <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12 midnight</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there were no more <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span>
that would take her to her hometown, Solano, she and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
agreed to just stroll along the streets of <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>
in the moonlit night.</p>

<p class="BODY">They walked from the school up to the capitol ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, they sat on one of the benches and
conversed for about 2 hours.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, they decided to walk around, be­cause they did not want people to see
them still together at that late hour.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They walked through the streets until they came to the Perez grandstand
in the <span class="SpellE">Clisoc</span> Field.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
They were seated in the grandstand and had been conversing for about 30 minutes
when the three accused appeared and approached them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and
Boy <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> took her by the hands, while the third
one, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>, held <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
at bay with a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> started
embracing and kissing her, and touched her breast and pri­vate parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She struggled and cried for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> tried to
come to her aid twice, and twice <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> boxed him,
and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> was weakened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, accused <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
dragged her up the grandstand, and forced her to lie down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she struggled and was able to get
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
dragged her down from the grandstand.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> then held her by the hand and ordered
<span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> to follow them to the dike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They walked, <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
still holding her hand and threatening her with a knife, fol­lowed by <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> who had <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> between them.</p>

<p class="BODY">When they reached the dike, which was about 200 meters away from
the grandstand, <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> ordered <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> to take <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
away, which the two did.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The witness and <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> had walked a little farther
when the latter started kissing and embracing her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She resisted him, but <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
covered her mouth, and laid her on the ground; he slapped her face and boxed
her sternum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when she kept on
shouting, <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> strangled her; he re­moved her
blouse, forcibly took away her bra, her skirt and her panties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was nervous and frightened, and <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> was able to have sexual intercourse with her.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She kept on struggling and moving and <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>' organ
was removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to insert it
again, but desisted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, she felt a
sticky substance between her legs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although feeling weak, she grabbed her clothes and put them on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> threatened
to kill her if she would report to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also threatened to call his two com­panions
and she pleaded him not to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> would not let her go home, she decided to go along
with him and pretended that she liked him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> brought her to the house of one Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bongcad</span> to whom she was introduced as <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>'
sweetheart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She kept her peace because
she was afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, when she
reiterated to <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> her desire to go home to
change her clothes, he consented.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
She took a tricycle and dropped first at the residence of <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
and informed his mother about the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, she proceeded to the municipal building and reported what happened
to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later in the day, she was
brought to the provincial hospital where she submitted to a phy­sical examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant further declared that on account
of the incident, she had to drop her studies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time of the hearing, she was no longer the girl friend of <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">AUGUSTO BRILLANTES took the witness stand and cor­roborated the
testimony of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
declared that in the evening of August 5, 1966, he attended the festivities at
St. Mary's College with his girl friend, <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Reyes;
that the coronation ceremony ended at about 11:30 p.m.; that he and <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> left the school about an hour later; that as there
were no more <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> that would take <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> home to Solano, they decided to take a walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They walked to the capitol building ground
and sat on a bench for about one and a half hours; then, they strolled away and
went to the Perez grandstand at the <span class="SpellE">Clisoc</span> Field
beside the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
high school.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
They were seated in the grandstand conversing for about an hour when they saw
three men approaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> went down to avoid them, but the men overtook them,
and accused <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>
held <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> and took her away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was left with accused <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
who pointed a bolo at his stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
tried to help <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> who was crying for help, but <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> hit him in the solar plexus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when he ran up towards the grandstand to
where <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> was, he was met by <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> who pointed a bolo at him and poked a gun
at his side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he tried to free him­self
from their hold, <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> boxed him, and he became
unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he regained
consciousness, <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> ordered them to walk towards
the dike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> were ahead of them, the former holding a
knife against <span class="SpellE">Minda's</span> side; he was made to walk
between <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>
who had their weapons pointed at his sides.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On reaching the edge of the dike, <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
ordered <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> to
take him away, so the two forced him to go to the other side of the dike some
50 meters away.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
There, he was held at bay until it was about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30</st1:time>
or <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he inquired from his two guards where <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> could be, <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> left to look for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villar</span> returned
informing them that the two could not be located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness then was taken by <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> to the junction
where he took a tricycle ride.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
returned, however, to the dike to look for <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> and
when he failed to find her, he thought of going to the municipal building to
report the incident to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the way to the town hall, he passed by their house and heard his mother in
hysterics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He learned that <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> had already passed that way and had informed his
mother that he was missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stayed by
his mother's side until about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time>
when she finally calmed down.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This witness admitted that when he was taken away by <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, he was not able
to see <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> and <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
anymore;<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and during all the time that they were at the other side of the dike, these
accused never left his side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
declared that he severed his relationship with <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
Reyes because of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented accused EDMUND MAGAT, who declared in court
that after attending the coronation ceremony at St. Mary's College in the
evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1966</st1:date>,
he conducted his girl friend to her residence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was walking home with a friend and neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, when they were called by Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> in front of the billiard hall, and they were
invited to watch the games.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They joined <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> and stayed in the billiard hall for about one or
two hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, they decided to go
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they were almost at the
corner of the road leading to the house of <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>,
the latter asked his two companions to ac­company him to the grandstand where
he intended to pass the night, reasoning that his father would get angry at his
late arrival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> obliged and went with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Near the grandstand, they heard a woman
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She turned out to be <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Reyes who was then being embraced by <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> approached
them, and he was met by <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> who took him aside
about 9 meters away, and told him something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> returned to his companions, he
told them they were going home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Minda</span> thereupon ran after them, and wanted to go with them
because <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> allegedly was drunk and was making a
fool of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
walked with <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> ahead of the witness and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
crossing near the Girl Scouts building, <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
turned to them and ordered him and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> to go home,
which they did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their house, it was
his father who opened the door for him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, as his father was scolding him for his late arrival, the witness
had to narrate what he and his companions saw at the grandstand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had already gone to sleep when he was
awakened by their neighbor, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Bulaya</span>, who was
called by his father, and he had to repeat to the policeman the incident that
they witnessed at the grandstand.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Magat</span> denied that he was armed when he
and his com­panions went to the grandstand; that they had threatened <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> with harm, and that he tried to abuse <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony, accused EUGENIO VILLAR corroborated <span class="SpellE">Magat's</span> declarations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He, too, denied the charges that they were armed when they went to the
grand stand; that they tried to abuse <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>, and that
he boxed <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman FERNANDO BULAYA of the <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>
Police Force testified that between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning of August 7,
1966, Juan <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> woke him up in his house and related
to him the information given by his (<span class="SpellE">Magat's</span>) on
about the finding by the latter and his companions of a crying woman in the
grandstand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then went to the <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> residence to get from Edmund the whole story, and the
latter repeated to him the information pre­viously given to the father, and
that <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
raped the woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With Juan <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>, whom he requested to accompany him, we went to the
grandstand to verify Edmund's story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finding no one in the place, they dropped at the house of <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> and they were told that <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>
was sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They passed by the dyke
and still meeting no one, they dropped by the house of <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>,
which they found to be silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
witness then went to the municipal building intending to make a report on the
matter, but he already found <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Reyes giving her
statement to the officer on duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did
not make a report anymore.</p>

<p class="BODY">JUAN MAGAT testified along the same line as the policeman's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared having learned from his son about
their finding of a woman crying in the grandstand; that he went out and got
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Bulaya</span> to interrogate Edmund, because he
was interested to find the involvement of his said son in the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, accused CARLOS PASTORES declared that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1966</st1:date>, he was at the Hawaiian Recreational Hall
when he chanced upon Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, passing by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invited the two to watch the games and
they came in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, as <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> wanted to go home, they walked out of the hall
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he was afraid that his
father would get angry with him for coming in late, so he asked his companions
to accompany him to the grandstand where he intended to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a distance of about 30 meters from the
grandstand, they heard the voice of a crying woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found out she was <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
Reyes, who was with <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he went near the couple, <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> got up, pulled him aside, and told him that he had
sexual intercourse with the girl who did not like it and he had to force
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
then requested him to leave him and <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He returned to his companions and in­formed
them they were leaving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> ran after them, held on to his hand and expressed
desire to go with them because <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> was drunk and
he might fool with her again.</p>

<p class="BODY">They left the grandstand; <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> walking behind
him and <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;

leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he and <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
continued walking until they reached the dike.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, they met Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Bicera</span>, to whom he introduced <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
as his sweetheart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also met Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bicera</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bicera's</span> brother
who were both working as "<span class="SpellE">bangkero</span>"
(boatmen) in the river, and when they were teased about their forthcoming
marriage, <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> smiled and pinched him at his side.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> asked him for transportation money, and since he had
none, they proceeded to the house of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bongcad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, they took coffee; he was sleepy, so he
went inside the room and slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Minda</span> later came into the room, took off his shoes which
were muddy and washed them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Minda</span> came in again to remind him of the money she was
asking for, so he asked Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bongcad</span> to give <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> some.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bongcad</span> had only fifty centavos which she gave to <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt

and returned to their own house when he could no longer wait for <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">He denied that he threatened <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> or
boxed <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>, and declared that he knew <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>, who was a classmate of his in one subject at the St.
Mary's College, and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>, because they were from
the same barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony of
accused <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> was corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Bicera</span>, <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ascado</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Bongcad</span> who all
declared that <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> was, introduced to them by <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> as his girl friend, to which introduction <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> merely smiled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the evidence thus presented, the court in its decision
of May 31, 1968 found the charges against the accused to have been duly proved,
and declared Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> liable for the rape of <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Reyes as principal by, direct participation, and
accused Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villar</span> as principals by indispensable coopera­tion,
for their role in separating <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> from the victim and standing guard over him,
which acts enabled accused Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> to commit
the rape with­out interference or intervention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the three accused were sentenced to life imprisonment, and
ordered to indemnify the victim, jointly and severally, in the amount of
P5,000.00 and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
this decision, the accused interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this instance, appellants raise the question of jurisdiction
of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is pointed out
that whereas the sworn complaint signed by <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> V.
Reyes on August 15, 1966 charged the accused of having sexual know­ledge of the
complainant by "taking advantage of the fact that said <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
Reyes was then in a state of coma or <span class="SpellE">unconciousness</span>",
the information filed by the Provincial Fiscal, which does not contain the
signature of the offen­ded party, alleged that the offense was committed
through force, threat and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants, therefore, contend that as the allegation of the information
charges a rape committed in a manner different from that charged in the
complaint signed by the offended party, then such complaint can not properly be
made the basis of the information as require by Section 4, Rule 110 of the
Revised Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, the issue being presented here is whether or not a complaint
signed by the offended party charging rape committed in a particular way can be
the basis of an information charging rape com­mitted in another way, for
purposes of conferring jurisdiction on the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue is not really new; it has already been answered in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Bangalao</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
involving exactly the same set of facts, this Court ruled that an information
charging rape committed on a minor and demented girl, based upon the complaint
signed by the girl's mother alleging rape committed by means of force and
intimidation, lawfully confers jurisdiction on the court to try the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the ruling was given, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
the case at bar, however, the complaint was for rape, and this gave the court
jurisdiction to try the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power
or jurisdiction of the court is not over the crime of rape when committed on a
minor and demented girl, but over rape, irrespective of the manner in which the
same may have been committed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be borne in mind that complaints are prepared in
municipalities, in most cases without the advice or help of competent
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case reaches the court
of first ins­tance, the Fiscal usually conducts another in­vestigation, and
thereafter files the infor­mation which the results thereof justify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right and power of the court to try the
accused for the crime of rape attaches upon the filing of the complaint, and a
change in the allegations thereof as (to) the manner of committing the crime
should not operate to divest the court of the jurisdiction it has already
acquired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right or power to try the
case should be distinguished from the right of the accused to demand an
acquittal unless it is shown that he has committed the offense charged in the
information even if he be found guilty of another offense; in the latter case,
however, even if the court has no right to find the accused guilty because the
crime al­leged is different from that proved, it cannot be stated that the
court has no jurisdiction over the case."(on p. 336)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> likewise questions
the decision finding him guilty of rape, making capital of the fact that the
physician who conducted the physical examination of the complainant after the
incident found her hymen to be intact, and that <span class="SpellE">Minda's</span>
behavior when she was seen by witnesses <span class="SpellE">Bicera</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bongcad</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Ascado</span> did not
indicate that she had just been ravished.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling of the court below as regard <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
must be affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered
that the fact that a woman's hymen has no sign of laceration does not preclude
a finding of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the rupture of
the hymen or la­ceration of any part of the woman's genitalia is not
indispensable to a conviction for rape;<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
it is enough that there is proof of entrance of the male organ within the labia
of the pudendum.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, in addition to the positive declaration of the complainant
about the consummation of rape on her person, we have the testimony of the
examining physician that when he examined complain­ant at about 11 o'clock in
the morning of August 6, 1966, he found contusions in the vulva, congested
condition and discoloration of hymen, and fresh laceration at the pos­terior <span class="SpellE">fourchette</span> -- injuries which indicated that the object that
inflicted them had penetrated past the labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span>
of the pudendum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
condition of complainant's <span class="SpellE">unruptured</span> hymen was
explained by the same physician during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that there is a type of hymen,
the elastic kind, that returns back to its original virginal appearance even
after sexual intercourse, and complainant's belongs to this type.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It may be true that, as testified to by witnesses <span class="SpellE">Bicera</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bongcad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ascado</span>, when complainant <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
Reyes was introduced to them by accused <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> as
his girl friend, she acknowledged the introduction with smiles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that is understandable, considering that
according to complainant, she pretended that she liked the accused in the hope
that by so doing, he would allow her to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it must really be this display of
docility that reassured <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> that <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> was under his control, so that when she again asked
for permission to go home, he finally consented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, if <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
went voluntarily with appellant, as the defense would want the court to
believe, because she wanted to avoid the company of <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>,
then why would she continue walking with appellant and accom­pany him in paying
visits to his friends even after <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> had dropped
out of sight?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, it is rather
strange that a girl who, a few hours before, did not even want to be seen
conversing with her boy friend in a public place such as the capitol grounds
for fear of what people would say, would willingly go with a man whom she
hardly knew<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
and walk with him in a more or less isolated place at early morning hours, and
allow herself to be introduced to his acquaintances as his girl friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also runs counter to the normal course of
human behavior that a girl who likes a boy would kiss and bid him goodbye (as
defense witnesses testified <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> did), and the
moment she was out of his sight, would proceed directly to the municipal
building to file a complaint for rape against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's behavior after the assault
actually supports her assertion that she was threatened by <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
that he would allow his two companions to do to her what he (<span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>) had already done, thus making her decide to go
along with the latter's idea in order that she may have the chance to get away
from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truly, a young woman and a
college student at that, like this complainant, would not have charged a man of
having raped her and come out and give all the sordid details of her debasement
in open court, if she were not really subjected to such outrageous act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sustain, therefore, the trial court's
ruling giving more credence to the testimony of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it may be said that her not offering
resistance to appellant's imposi­tion, that she should go with him after her
violation, was a ruse resorted to in order to escape from further harm and
enabled her later to go directly to the police authorities to report and charge
the proper author of the criminal act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant's conduct indicates an ad­mirable presence of mind that
bespeaks well of her character and intelligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the accused appellants Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, their
attacks on the credibility of the offended party and other witnesses of the
prosecution are not substantially different from those of appellant <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>, which were properly disregarded by the trial
court as earlier discussed (pages 9-10).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same thing can be said of their contention that no rape could have
taken place, in view of the complainant's <span class="SpellE">unruptured</span>
hymen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this stand is untenable has
been previously shown in this opinion (pages 8-9).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court considered that all the accused appellants acted
in conspiracy and are equally responsible as co-principals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with defense counsel that the
details of commission of the offense do not satisfactorily support the finding
of conspiracy, particularly in view of the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
fact that the herein appellants met the complainant <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
Reyes and her companion and friend, <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>,
purely by chance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever the
responsibility of <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>,
it must be predicated on their action in separating <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>
from the complainant when all five had reached the river dike, and thereafter
preventing <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> from rendering aid to <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this
act was undoubtedly one of help and cooperation, We do not view it as
indispensable, so that the rape could not have been committed without the
sequestration of <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be recalled that at the grandstand,
the latter proved no match for <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>, who boxed
and effectively weakened <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>; and further, <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> was then armed with a knife while <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> had no weapon.</p>

<p class="BODY">That <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
were aware of <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>' criminal design to rape <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Reyes is apparent under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon returning home <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
advised his father of what transpired at the river dyke, and thereafter the
father informed patrolman <span class="SpellE">Bulaya</span> that <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> had been raped.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering that appellant Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> had not seen
either <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> or <span class="SpellE">Minda</span>
Reyes at the river dyke after he and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span> had taken
<span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> away, <span class="SpellE">Magat's</span>
informing his father that <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> had been raped
demonstrates these two appellants' awareness of what <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>
intended to do with <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> when he asked his two
companions to guard <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> while he (<span class="SpellE">Pastores</span>) compelled <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> to go
with him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Villar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magat's</span>
cooperation not being indispensable for the commission of the crime, they are
only liable as accomplices, as admitted by <span class="SpellE">Villar's</span>
counsel in his brief (page 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Balili</span> (G. R. L-14044,
August 5, 1966, 17 SCRA 892-898), the accused who stayed outside the house
while the others robbed and killed the victims yet had knowledge of the
criminal intention of the other accused and only went along with them was only
convicted as an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the
case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> (46 Phil. 775), three
of the accused who held the victim's companions to prevent the latter from
rendering any help to the victim who was being kidnapped were only convicted as
accomplices, even if cir­cumstances indicated conspiracy among them, for their
acts were not indispensable to the realization of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well known is the rule that in case of doubt
as to the participation of an accused the lesser liability should prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, 44 Phil. 38, this
Court made the obser­vation that -</p>

<blockquote>"………………………….. as against an accomplice, a court will sometimes
draw the inference of guilty participation in the criminal design from acts of
concert in the consum­mation of the criminal act and from the form and manner
in which assistance is rendered, where it would not draw the same inference for
the purpose of holding the same accused in the character of principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because, in case of doubt, the courts
naturally lean to the milder form of responsibility."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The preceding doctrine was followed in many subsequent cases,
collated in the decision penned by Mr. justice Fernando in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, G. R. No. L-29419, <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for an accomplice is one degree lower than that
prescribed for a principal (Rev. Penal Code, Article 52); so that <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> having been meted out <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>, the penalty for his accomplices should be <u>reclusion
temporal</u>, ranging from 12 years and one (1) day to 20 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the indeterminate sentence law (Acts
4103 and 4225), <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>
should be sentenced to a minimum penalty within the range of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> and to a maximum within the range
of <u>reclusion temporal</u> (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, 60
Phil. 400).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed in so
far as it finds appellant Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pastores</span> guilty as
principal in the rape of com­plainant <span class="SpellE">Minda</span> Reyes;
but the decision is modified as to Edmund <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>, who are found
guilty as accomplices merely, instead of co-principals, and each one of the two
is sentenced to undergo a minimum of eight (8) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
mayor</u> and a maximum of sixteen (16) years of <u>reclusion temporal</u>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>All three are jointly and severally con­demned
