				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court of Industrial Relations, in a decision dated January
20, 1971, adjudged Domingo Jose and the corporations controlled by him, known
as <span class="SpellE">Dojose</span> and <span class="SpellE">Domel</span>
Trading, guilty of unfair labor practice for having dismissed <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> due to his union
activities, and ordered them to reinstate him to<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>his former position of driver, with back wages from <u>May, 1964</u>,
the date of the dismissal, up to his actual reinstatement (CIR Case No.
5277-ULP).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR denied the two
motions for reconsideration of Domingo Jose, <span class="SpellE">Dojose</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Domel</span> Trading.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of asking this Court to review that decision, Domingo
Jose, <span class="SpellE">Dojose</span> and <span class="SpellE">Domel</span>
Trading on <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1972</st1:date>
filed a motion in the CIR "to reopen the case".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR denied the motion in its order of <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1974</st1:date>
Domingo Jose, <span class="SpellE">Dojose</span> and <span class="SpellE">Domel</span>
Trading, with <span class="GramE">a pertinacity</span> worthy of a better cause,
filed another motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, they moved that they be given a chance to argue the motion
orally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR did not act on those
motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the Labor Code became
effective, the case was turned over to the National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1975</st1:date> the NLRC affirmed the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> 1971
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Domingo Jose, <span class="SpellE">Dojose</span> and <span class="SpellE">Domel</span> Trading appealed
to the <span class="GramE">Secretary of Labor.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary, in a minute order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1976</st1:date>, affirmed the <span class="GramE">NLRC' s</span> decision with the modification that the earnings of <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the case should be deducted from his back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1976</st1:date>
Domingo Jose, <span class="SpellE">Dojose</span> and <span class="SpellE">Domel</span>
Trading filed in this Court the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners seek to
annul the 1971 judgment of the CIR on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also contend that they were denied due
process; that the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> decision is not supported by
substantial evidence; that there was no employer-employee relationship between <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> and the petitioners; that the two corporations
were not yet in existence when the alleged unfair labor practice was committed,
and that Domingo Jose, who had employed <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> as
his family driver, was not sued as the employer of <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> in his answer stressed that
the long final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision of the CIR
could no longer be disturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Secretary of Labor and the NLRC, through the Solicitor
General, interposed the plea of <span class="SpellE">nonexhaustion</span> of
administrative remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contended
that the petitioners should have appealed to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Art. 222, Labor Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor
General observed that the CIR had jurisdiction to decide the unfair labor
practice case, that the NLRC and the Secretary of Labor had jurisdiction to
review the CIR decision (Art. 289, Labor Code), and that they did not gravely
abuse their discretion in affirming the CIR decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He adverted to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>, although a family driver, was employed in
Jose's business, which later became the business of two corporations controlled
by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether the petitioners have a cause of action for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition or whether at this late hour the 1971 judgment of the <span style="">CIR </span>can still be annulled or modified.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the petition is patently devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR and the NLRC did not act without
jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no jurisdictional issue involved in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners simply failed to appeal from the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
should have seasonably appealed to this Court so that their contention that the
decision is not supported by substantial evidence could have been duly
resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they resorted to
dilatory tactics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> decision has the force of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span> was
allegedly the family driver of Atty. Julian <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>
from February 1, 1966 to March 30, 1968 and that from December 5, 1969 up to
January 28, 1971, he was an ''extra regular taxi driver" of the <span class="SpellE">Zomar</span> Taxi (pp. 83-84, Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of these alleged facts, the Secretary
of Labor directed that the earnings of <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>
should be deducted from his back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of the Secretary of Labor is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

Antonio, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
