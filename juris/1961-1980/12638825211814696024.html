				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This case is about the propriety of a separate action to compel a
distressed rural bank, which is under judicial liquidation, to accept a check
in payment of a mortgage debt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The facts
are as follows:</p>

<p class=BODY>On March 21, 1961 the spouses Francisco S. Hernandez and <span
class=SpellE>Josefa</span> U. <span class=SpellE>Atienza</span> obtained from
the Rural Bank of <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span>, Inc. a loan of P6,000 which
was payable on March 21, 1962.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The loan
was secured by a mortgage on their two lots situated in <span class=SpellE>Cubao</span>,
<st1:City><st1:place><span class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:City>
with a total area of 600 square meters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The interest for one year was paid in advance.</p>

<p class=BODY>About three months after that loan was obtained, the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank became a distressed bank.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a letter dated June 16, 1961 the Acting
Governor of the Central Bank apprised the stock-<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>offered to pay the loan by means of a check for P6,000 dated August 8,
1961 which was drawn against the bank by a depositor, the San Pablo Colleges,
and which was payable to Hernandez.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
the bank's executive vice-president was not available, the payment was not
consummated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>At the time that the
check was issued, the San Pablo Colleges had a deposit in the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank amounting to P11,890.16 (27 <span class=SpellE>tsn</span>
</span><st1:date Year="1966" Day="25" Month="4"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
 13.0pt'>April 25, 1966</span></st1:date><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead of withdrawing P6,000 from that
deposit, the San Pablo Colleges chose to issue a check for that amount to
Hernandez.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is not clear whether in
August, 1961 the San Pablo Colleges could make a withdrawal from its deposit in
the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>On the following day, August 23, Hernandez sent to the bank by
registered mail a <span class=SpellE>photostat</span> of the check and a letter
inquiring whether the bank would honor the check and when he could go
personally to the bank for that purpose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That letter was received by the bank on August 29.</p>

<p class=BODY>On August 30, the executive vice-president wrote to Hernandez and
informed him that the check could not be honored for the time being because of
adverse events that had disrupted the bank's operations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the vice-president meant was that by
reason of the letter of the Central Bank Governor dated <st1:date Year="1961"
Day="16" Month="6">June 16, 1961</st1:date> the operations of the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank were suspended (6 <span class=SpellE>tsn</span>
<st1:date Year="1966" Day="15" Month="8">August 15, 1966</st1:date>).</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The vice-president
explained that because there was a run on the bank its assets were exhausted,
and so the check sent by Hernandez, which check was drawn against the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank, could not be accepted (16, 21-24 <span
class=SpellE>tsn</span> </span><st1:date Year="1966" Day="15" Month="8"><span
 style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>August 15, 1966</span></st1:date><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The vice-president said that when Hernandez presented the check,
the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank was no longer in a position to honor
withdrawals and that had Hernandez paid cash, his payment would <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>have been accepted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To honor the check would have been tantamount
</span>to allowing a depositor (San Pablo Colleges) to make a withdrawal but
the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank could not entertain withdrawals
without the consent of the Central Bank examiners (26-28 <span class=SpellE>tsn</span>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Payment by check was a disbursement (31 <span
class=SpellE>tsn</span>).</p>

<p class=BODY>Apparently, the vice-president did not take the trouble of asking
the Central Bank examiners whether the payment by check made by Hernandez could
be accepted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hernandez himself, who
should have known that the bank was a distressed bank which had suspended
operations and which was under the supervision of Central Bank examiners, did
not bother to take up his problem with the said examiners.</p>

<p class=BODY>Hernandez, in his letter of <st1:date Year="1961" Day="18"
Month="10">October 18, 1961</st1:date>, again asked the bank when he could
deliver the check.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The executive
vice-president, in his reply of October 24, told Hernandez that the bank could
not yet honor the check because it had not resumed its banking operations; that
it was awaiting the outcome of a case filed by the bank against the Central
Bank; that it might reopen in January, 1962, and that, anyway, the loan would
not be due until March 21, 1962.</p>

<p class=BODY>Hernandez sent another letter dated <st1:date Year="1962" Day="1"
Month="2">February 1, 1962</st1:date>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Finally, he enclosed the original check (duly endorsed) with his letter
to the bank dated <st1:date Year="1962" Day="7" Month="3">March 7, 1962</st1:date>,
which was sent by registered mail and special delivery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That letter of March 7, together with the
check, was returned to Hernandez because the bank's manager was allegedly in <st1:City><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Undeterred, Hernandez again mailed the check
to the bank on April 25, with the request that his mortgage be cancelled.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the meantime, the Monetary Board had decided to liquidate the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Governor of the Central Bank in a letter dated February 8, 1962 enjoined the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank from transacting business and advised it to
turn over its assets, documents and records to the chief bank examiner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank building was sealed.</p>

<p class=BODY>The following notice was posted at the entrance of the building:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;This bank is temporarily closed pending final decision of the
courts as to its status.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Payments of
loans will be accepted; meanwhile, no payments of withdrawals against deposits
can be made.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Please transact business
with the Central Bank's representatives only.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>To head off the liquidation, the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span>
bank filed with the Court of First Instance at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  class=SpellE>Lucena</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
a complaint dated <st1:date Year="1962" Day="12" Month="2">February 12, 1962</st1:date>,
praying that the Central Bank be enjoined from liquidating the said bank.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On February 14, the court issued an <u><span

<p class=BODY>On <st1:date Year="1962" Day="14" Month="2">February 14, 1962</st1:date>
the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> court rendered a decision in Civil Case No.
47345, restraining the enforcement of the Monetary Board resolution, which
required the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank to undertake a reorganization
and to curtail its operations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Central Bank appealed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(This Court

<p class=BODY>To implement the resolution of the Monetary Board for the
liquidation of the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank, the Central Bank,
pursuant to section 29 of its charter and on the assumption that the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank was insolvent, filed with the Court of First
Instance of Manila a petition dated March 27, 1962 for assistance and
supervision in the liquidation of the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank
(Civil Case No. 50019).</p>

<p class=BODY>Acting on that petition, the Court of First Instance of Manila
issued an order dated <st1:date Year="1963" Day="28" Month="3">March 28, 1963</st1:date>,
directing the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank to turn over its assets to
the Central Bank's authorized representative.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Monetary Board in its Resolution No. 426 dated <st1:date
Year="1963" Day="2" Month="4">April 2, 1963</st1:date> designated the
Superintendent of Banks or his duly authorized representative to take charge of
the assets of the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Board in its resolution of <st1:date Year="1963" Day="27"
Month="11">November 27, 1963</st1:date> ordered the Superintendent of Banks to
convert the assets of the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank to money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank, by
means of <i>certiorari</i>, sought to annul the liquidation proceeding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This Court denied its petition (Rural Bank of
<span class=SpellE>Lucena</span>, Inc. vs. <span class=SpellE>Arca</span>,
L-21146, September 20, 1965, 15 SCRA 66).</p>

<p class=BODY>Among the accounts receivable of the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span>
bank inventoried by the Central Bank' s representative was the account of
Hernandez.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a letter dated <st1:date
Year="1963" Day="29" Month="10">October 29, 1963</st1:date> Hernandez informed
the Central Bank that he had sent to the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank
on <st1:date Year="1962" Day="25" Month="4">April 25, 1962</st1:date> the check
for P6,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He again requested that his
mortgage be cancelled.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Associate Superintendent of Banks in his answer dated December
9, 1963 returned the check to Hernandez and informed him that, according to the
<span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank's executive vice-president, the check
could not be applied to the payment of Hernandez' loan because the bank was
already closed when he received the check.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Moreover, the check was drawn against the current deposits of the San
Pablo Colleges in the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank which was in the
process of liquidation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hernandez was
advised to settle his account by paying cash or by means of a check drawn
against a bank other than the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank.</p>

<p class=BODY>Disregarding that suggestion, Hernandez announced to the
Associate Superintendent of Banks in his letter of <st1:date Year="1963"
Day="16" Month="12">December 16, 1963</st1:date> that he was going to deposit
the said check in the Court of First Instance of <span class=SpellE>Lipa</span>
City on or before <st1:date Year="1963" Day="26" Month="12">December 26, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class=BODY>Instead of filing a consignation complaint, Hernandez enclosed
the check with his letter dated <st1:date Year="1964" Day="2" Month="1">January
 2, 1964</st1:date> to the clerk of court of the Court of First Instance at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  class=SpellE>Lipa</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span

Year="1964" Day="6" Month="1">January 6, 1964</st1:date>.<span

Year="1964" Day="11" Month="1">January 11, 1964</st1:date> informing the
Associate Superintendent of Banks of the judicial deposit of the check.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Copies of that letter were furnished the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank and the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>San Pablo</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Colleges</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=BODY>It was only on <st1:date Year="1964" Day="12" Month="10"><u>October
 12, 1964</u></st1:date> when Hernandez and his wife filed an action in the
Court of First Instance at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span class=SpellE>Lipa</span></st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> to compel the Rural Bank of <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span>, Inc., the Central Bank as liquidator, and Jose S.
Martinez as receiver, to accept the check and to execute the cancellation of
the real estate mort­gage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Hernandez
spouses also asked for moral damages in the amount of <u>P10,000</u> and
attorney's fees of P3,000 (Civil Case No. 1615).</p>

<p class=BODY>On <st1:date Year="1964" Day="20" Month="10">October 20, 1964</st1:date>
the Central Bank filed a motion to dismiss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It contended that there was improper venue because, as the action
allegedly involved title to real property, it should have been instituted in <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:City> where the encumbered
lots are situated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It further contended
that since the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank is under liquidation and
is in the hands of a receiver, its properties and assets are in <span
class=SpellE><u>custodia</u></span> <span class=SpellE><u>legis</u></span> and
may, therefore, be reached only by motion or petition in Civil Case No. 50019
of the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The motion was denied.</p>

<p class=BODY>To complete the facts, it should be stated that the counsel for
the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank on January 30, 1967 offered to
compromise the case by stipulating that the Central Bank would apply the check
in question to the mortgage debt of Hernandez if the balance of the deposit of
the San Pablo Colleges would be enough to cover the amount of the check of
P6,000 and that, by virtue of that compromise, the complaint and counterclaim
would be dismissed.</p>

<p class=BODY>That conditional and equivocal compromise offer fizzled out
because the lawyers of Hernandez and the Central Bank did not assent to it.</p>

<p class=BODY>After trial, the lower court rendered an amended decision dated <st1:date
Year="1967" Day="31" Month="10">October 31, 1967</st1:date>, ordering the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank or the Central Bank, as liquidator, to accept
and honor the check, to cancel the mortgage, and to pay the Hernandez spouses <u>P25,000</u>
as moral damages (not P10,000 as prayed for in the complaint) plus P1,000 as
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class=BODY>The <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank, the Central Bank and
its employee, the receiver, appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Central Bank contends that the trial <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>court </span>erred (1) in not holding that the venue was improperly
laid; (2) in not holding that it had no jurisdiction because the Hernandez
spouses should have ventilated their claim in the liquidation proceeding
pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila, instead of filing a separate
action in the Court of First Instance at <span class=SpellE>Lipa</span> City;
(3) in not holding that there was no valid consignation; (4) in awarding moral
damages and attorney's fees, and (5) in ordering execution pending appeal in
spite of the fact that the assets of the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank
are in <span class=SpellE><u>custodia</u></span> <span class=SpellE><u>legis</u></span>
or in the custody of the liquidation court and the receiver appointed by it.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the issue of venue, defendants-appellants contend that the
action of the Hernandez spouses to compel them to honor the check in question
and to cancel the mortgage on their two lots is <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>a </span>real action affecting title to real property which should have
been filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span> at
<span class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City where the mortgaged lots are situated.</p>

<p class=BODY>Section 2(a), Rule 4 of the Rules of Court provides that
&quot;actions affecting title to, or for recovery of possession, or for
partition or condemnation of, or foreclosure of mortgage on, real property,
shall be commenced and tried in the province where the property or any part
thereof lies&quot;.</p>

<p class=BODY>Note that the rule mentions an action for foreclosure of a real
estate mortgage but does not mention an action for the cancellation of a real
mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the instant case, the
action is primarily to compel the mortgagee to <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>accept payment </span>of the mortgage debt and to release the mortgage.</p>

<p class=BODY>That action, which is not expressly included in the enumeration
found in section 2(a) of Rule 4, does not involve the title to the mortgaged
lots.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is a personal action and not a
real action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee has not foreclosed
the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Plaintiffs' title is not
in question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are in possession of
the mortgaged lots.</p>

<p class=BODY>Hence, the venue of plaintiffs' personal action is the place
where the defendant or any of the defendants resides or may be found, or where
the plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs resides, at the election of the
plaintiff (Sec. 2[b], Rule 4).</p>

<p class=BODY>The plaintiffs in their brief confound a real action with an
action <u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>rem</u></span> and a personal action
with an action <u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>personam</u></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They argue that their action is not an action
<u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>rem</u></span> and, therefore, it could be
brought in a place other than the place where the mortgaged lots are located.</p>

<p class=BODY>A real action is not the same as an action <u>in</u> <span
class=SpellE><u>rem</u></span> and a personal action is not the same as an
action <u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>personam</u></span>.</p>

<p class=BODY>In a personal action, the plaintiff seeks the recovery of
personal property, the enforcement of a contract or the recovery of
damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a real action, the plaintiff
seeks the recovery of real property, or, as indicated in section 2(a) of Rule
4, a real action is an action affecting title to real property or for the
recovery of possession, or for partition or condemnation of, or fore­closure of
a mortgage on, real property.</p>

<p class=BODY>An action <u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>personam</u></span> is
an action against a person on the basis of his personal liability, while an
action <u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>rem</u></span> is an action against the
thing itself, instead of against the person <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>(1 </span>C. J. S. 943-4).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Hence, a real action may <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>at the </span>same
time be an action <u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>personam</u></span> and not
necessarily an action <u>in</u> <span class=SpellE><u>rem</u></span>.</p>

<p class=BODY>In this case, the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that they
were residents of San Juan, <span class=SpellE>Batangas</span>, which in their
brief they characterize as their legal residence and which appears to be their
domicile of origin.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the other hand, it is indicated in the promissory note and
mortgage signed by them and in the Torrens title covering the mortgaged lots
that their residence is at 11 Chicago Street, <span class=SpellE>Cubao</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City, which apparently is the place where the said
lots are located.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiffs did not
testify during the trial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, they have
no testimony in the record as to their actual residence.</p>

<p class=BODY>We hold that the trial court should have dismissed the action
because the venue thereof was improperly laid in <span class=SpellE>Batangas</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The term &quot;resides&quot; in section 2[b]
of Rule 4 refers to the place of actual residence or the place of abode and not
necessarily to the legal residence or domicile (<span class=SpellE>Dangwa</span>
Transportation Co., Inc. vs. <span class=SpellE>Sarmiento</span>, L-22795,
January 31, 1977, 75 SCRA 124, 128).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Of
course, the actual residence may also in some cases be the legal residence or
domicile.)</p>

<p class=BODY>San Juan, <span class=SpellE>Batangas</span> might be the place
where the plaintiffs have their domicile or legal residence but there is no
question that 11 Chicago Street, <span class=SpellE>Cubao</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City is their place of abode or the place where they
actually reside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, the action in this
case, which is a personal action to compel the defendants to honor the check in
question and to cancel the mortgage, should have been filed in <span
class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City if the plaintiffs intended to use their
residence as the basis for their choice of venue.</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, it was held that venue was improperly laid in a case where
plaintiff Jose Coloma filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of <span
class=SpellE>Ilocos</span> Norte, because he was allegedly a resident of San
Nicolas, <span class=SpellE>Ilocos</span> Norte, where he was born and reared,
but his actual residence was at, 57 K-6th <span class=SpellE>Kamias</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City or at 486 <span class=SpellE>Barangka</span>
Drive, <span class=SpellE>Mandaluyong</span>, <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span> (<span
class=SpellE>Koh</span> vs. Court of Appeals, L-40428, December 17, 1975; 70
SCRA 298).</p>

<p class=BODY>In Garcia <span class=SpellE>Fule</span> vs. Court of Appeals,
L-40502, November 29, 1976, 74 SCRA 189, it was held that an intestate
proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the deceased <span class=SpellE>Amado</span>
G. Garcia was improperly filed in the Court of First Instance of Laguna.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The deceased was allegedly domiciled in <span
class=SpellE>Calamba</span>, Laguna.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
was a delegate of the first district of Laguna to the constitutional convention.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, at the time of his death, he was
actually a resident of <st1:City><st1:place><span class=SpellE>Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence,
the proper venue of the intestate proceeding was <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the foregoing discussion, it is assumed that the plaintiffs
could bring a separate action to compel the defendants to honor the check in
question in spite of the fact that the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank is
under liquidation in Civil Case No. 50019 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Central Bank contends that such a separate action was not
maintainable and that the Hernandez spouses should have ventilated in the
liquidation proceeding their claim that they had already paid their mortgage
debt by means of the check issued by the San Pablo Colleges and that their
mortgage should be cancelled.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Central Bank points out that the redemption action of the
Hernandez spouses would ultimately affect the funds and property of the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> Bank.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence,
the liquidation court is the competent tribunal to pass upon the issue as to
whether the Hernandez spouses could validly pay their mortgage debt by means of
the check of the San Pablo Colleges.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the other hand, the Hernandez spouses argue that their action
in the Court of First Instance at <span class=SpellE>Lipa</span> City
&quot;deals With a sum of money which is still not in the possession, custody,
and administration&quot; of the Central Bank and the receiver; that their
action had &quot;nothing to do with the funds and property&quot; held by the
receiver; that the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank had not lost its
juridical personality after it was placed under liquidation, and that the issue
as to whether the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank should have accepted
the check in question was &quot;not in anyway connected with the causes and
grounds under which the liquidation proceedings were instituted nor with the
administration of the property and funds under liquidation&quot;.</p>

<p class=BODY>Those contentions of the Hernandez spouses are untenable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trial court did not rule squarely on the
jurisdictional issue raised by the Central Bank and the receiver.</p>

<p class=BODY>We hold that the liquidation court or the Manila court has exclusive
jurisdiction to entertain the claim of the Hernandez spouses that their
mortgage obligation had already been extin­guished by means of their tender of
the check issued by the San Pablo Colleges.</p>

<p class=BODY>At the time the Hernandez spouses filed <u>in 1964</u> their
consignation complaint the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank was already
under liquidation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Manila court in
its order of March 28, <u>1963</u> had ordered the officers of the <span
class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank to turn over to the Central Bank or to the
receiver, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>the </span>Superintendent of
Banks, all <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt'>a </span>its assets, properties
and papers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Among the assets turned over
to the receiver was the outstanding or unpaid account of the Hernandez spouses
which appears in the inventory as:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;393. Hernandez, Francisco S., <st1:Street><st1:address>11 Chicago
  St.</st1:address></st1:Street>, <span class=SpellE>Cubao</span>, Q. C.,
TCT-34262 - 3/21/61, P6,000.00&quot; (<span class=SpellE>Exh</span>. 4-CB).</p>

<p class=BODY>And among the papers or obligations turned over to the receiver
was Ledger No. 056 evidencing the deposit of the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>San </span>Pablo Colleges in the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank
in the sum of P11,890.16, against which the check for P6,000 was drawn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was that check which the Hernandez spouses
had issued to pay their mortgage debt to the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span>
bank.</p>

<p class=BODY>Under section 29 of the Central Bank Act, Republic Act No. 265,
when the Monetary Board, upon information submitted by the Superintendent of
Banks, finds a bank to be insolvent, it shall forbid the bank to do business
and it shall take care of its assets according to law.</p>

<p class=BODY>In that case, if the Monetary Board finds out that the insolvent
bank cannot resume business with safety to its creditors, it shall, through the
Solicitor General, file a petition in the Court of First Instance, praying for
the assistance and supervision of the court in the liquidation of the bank's
affairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thereafter, the Superintendent
of Banks, upon order of the Monetary Board and under the supervision of the
court, shall convert to money the bank's assets.<span

vs. Mercantile Bank of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
71 Phil. 573, 576).</p>

<p class=BODY>The fact that the insolvent bank is forbidden to do business,
that its assets are turned over to the Superintendent of Banks, as a receiver,
for conversion into cash, and that its liquidation is undertaken with judicial
intervention means that, as far as lawful and practicable, all claims against
the insolvent bank should be filed in the liquidation proceeding.</p>

<p class=BODY>The judicial liquidation is intended to prevent multiplicity of
actions against the insolvent bank.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
lawmaking body contemplated that for convenience only one court, if possible,
should pass upon the claims against the insolvent bank and that the liquidation
court should assist the Superintendent of Banks and control his operations.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the course of the liquidation, contentious cases might arise
wherein a full dress hearing would be required and legal issues would have to
be resolved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence, it would be
necessary in justice to all concerned that a Court of First Instance should
assist and supervise the liquidation and should act as umpire and arbitrator in
the allowance and disallowance of claims.</p>

<p class=BODY>The judicial liquidation is a pragmatic arrangement designed to
establish due process and orderliness in the liquidation of the bank, to
obviate the proliferation of litigations and to avoid injustice and
arbitrariness.</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, in the liquidation before the war of the insolvent
Mercantile Bank of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
various claims were adjudicated by the liquidation court, which was the Court
of First Instance of Manila, pursuant to section 1639 of the Revised
Administrative Code, from which section 29 of the Central Bank Law was
taken.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(See <u>In re</u> Liquidation of
Mercantile Bank of China:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tan <span

Pacific Coast Biscuit Co., 65 Phil. 443; Chinese Grocers' Association vs. American
Apothecaries Co., 65 Phil. 395; and Yu Ping Kun, 65 Phil. 410).</p>

<p class=BODY>There is a ruling that, although the taking over of a bank by
state officials for liquidation does not dissolve the bank, a court has no
jurisdiction (after such takeover) to entertain an action or to render a
judgment against the bank (9 C.J.S. 852, note 38 citing Bushnell vs. F. W.
Woolworth Co., 241 Pac. 738, 112 <span class=SpellE>Okl</span>. 297; State vs.
Quigley, 220 Pac. 918, 93 <span class=SpellE>Okl</span>. 296).</p>

<p class=BODY>It has been held that an insolvent bank, which was under the
control of the finance commissioner for liquidation, was without power or
capacity to sue or be sued, prosecute or defend, or to otherwise function
except through the finance commissioner or liquidator (<span class=SpellE>Wauer</span>
vs. Bank of Pendleton, 65 S. W. 2nd 167, 228 Mo. App. 1150).</p>

<p class=BODY>Suits brought against a bank after the issuance of a notice that
the finance commissioner has taken possession of the bank should be dismissed
or are barred for want of jurisdiction (Rouse vs. Bank of Darlington, 41 S. W.
2nd. 159; Bartlett vs. <span class=SpellE>McCallister</span>, 289 S. W. 814,
316 Mo. 129).</p>

<p class=BODY>This Court has already held that after a savings bank was
declared insolvent by the Monetary Board, a depositor could <span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>not </span>bring a separate action against it
for the recovery of his time deposit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>His remedy is to intervene in the liquidation proceeding (Central Bank
of the Philippines vs. <span class=SpellE>Morfe</span>, L-38427, March 12,

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>*</span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>In the instant case, the Hernandez spouses, after having become
cognizant of the fact that the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank was under
liquidation, chose to file a separate action against that bank for redemption
and damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although residents of <span
class=SpellE>Cubao</span>, <st1:City><st1:place><span class=SpellE>Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:City>, where the mortgaged lots are located and which
was the address used by them in dealing with the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span>
bank, they chose <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span class=SpellE>Lipa</span></st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> as the venue of their action.</p>

<p class=BODY>They ignored the liquidation court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Evidently, one of their objectives was to
obtain against the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span> bank a judgment for moral
damages which they surmised would not be granted by the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
liquidation court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They attained more
than what they had originally desired because, instead of the moral damages of <u>P10,000</u>
indicated in their complaint, the trial court generously awarded them <u>P25,000</u>.</p>

<p class=BODY>Not only that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trial
court granted execution pending appeal although it was aware that eventually
the claim of the Hernandez spouses would have to be submitted to the
liquidation court for allowance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
sheriff could not enforce the writ of execution because the <span class=SpellE>Lucena</span>
bank was under liquidation (p. 92, <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence, the Hernandez spouses had to file a
claim with the liquidation court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
claim has been pending since September, 1968.</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, much time, money and effort would have been saved if at the
outset the Hernandez spouses filed their claim in the liquidation court.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is reversed and set
aside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case is dismissed without
prejudice to the right of the Hernandez spouses to take up with the liquidation
court the settlement of their mortgage obligation.<span
