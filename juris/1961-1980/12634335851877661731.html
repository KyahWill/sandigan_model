				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court sets aside as grave abuse of discretion the res­pondent
court's reduction of the maximum administrative fine of P26<span class="GramE">,575.00</span>
imposed by petitioner Commissioner to a practically token fine of
P6,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>actual</u> gross
weight of the shipment exceeded by more than 400% its <u>declared</u> weight,
whereas the customs code allows a discrepancy only of not more than 20%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The underdeclaration is so gross that it
constitutes <u>per se</u> evidence of willful negligence or gross incompetence
on the part of the ves­sel's master and there is no valid justification for an
arbitrary reduction of the fine justly imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that on <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July
 16, 1969</st1:date>, the vessel SS "EURYBATES" arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> and discharged thereat 72
bales of textile remnants consigned to Balin Commercial of Manila and covered
by a bill of lading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gross weight of
said merchandise as <u>declared</u> in the bill of lading was 13,272 lbs., but
it was reported after examination and appraisal that the <u>actual</u> weight
was 66,579 lbs. or a discrepancy of 53,307 lbs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the actual gross weight of the merchandise exceeded by more than
400% the declared weight.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Delgado Shipping Agencies, Inc., in its capacity as
agent of the vessel, was accordingly required by the Bureau of Customs to show
cause why an administrative fine of P26,575.00 on the vessel should not be
imposed, which is the maximum fine that can be imposed against the vessel under
Section 2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After hearing, the Collector of Customs ren­dered his decision of <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1974</st1:date> finding the vessel
SS "EURYBATES" liable under the cited section of the Tariff and
Customs Code and ordering respondent Delgado Shipping Agencies, Inc. as its
agent to remit the said fine within ten days from finality of the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, petitioner
Commissioner of Customs in his decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1976</st1:date> affirmed that of the Collector of
Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said respondent appealed the petitioner's decision to respondent
Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision of
<st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1978</st1:date>, respondent
court affirmed the findings of petitioner commissioner and found that the
vessel did violate Section 2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, respondent court reduced the
fine imposed against private respondent from P26<span class="GramE">,575.00</span>
to P6,000.00 on the basis of its opinion that "it does not appear that the
negligence or incompetence of the master, owner, officer or employee of the
vessel amounts to willful negligence or gross incompetence, and considering
further that the law allows a latitude in the imposition of the fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our mind, the reasonable fine to be
imposed against said vessel is P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition of February 9, 1979 filed by petitioner
Commissioner of Customs to set aside such reduction of the fine on the ground
that respondent court gravely abused its discretion when it so reduced the
administrative fine by more than 75% from P26,575.00 to P6,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of respondents' comment and
petitioner's reply, the Court granted due course to the petition and,
dispensing with the filing of briefs or memoranda, declared the case submitted
for decision per its Resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="6">June
 20, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that respondent court did act with grave abuse of
discretion when it reduced the administrative fine notwithstanding the gross
misdeclaration of the weight of the manifested merchandise and therefore grants
the petition.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2523 of the
Tariff and Customs Code<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
authorizes the imposition of the administrative fine in the sum of P26<span class="GramE">,575.00</span> imposed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two requisites therein provided, namely,
(1) that the actual gross weight exceed by more than twenty per cen­tum the
declared gross weight and (2) that the discrepancy is due to carelessness or
incompetency of the master, owner or employee of the vessel, were duly found by
petitioner commissioner, as well as by respondent court, to be present in the
instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discre­pancy in the <u>declared</u>
gross weight of the cargo (13,272 lbs.) and its <u>actual</u> weight (66,579
lbs.) is so grave that it constitutes <u>per se</u> evidence of willful
negligence or gross incompetence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The actual gross weight of the shipment exceeded by more than four
hundred; (400%) percent its declared weight, whereas the statute allows a
discrepancy of not more than twenty (20%) percent.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the discrepancy of 53,307
lbs. (underdeclared weight) exceeded by more than twenty (20) times the 20%
discrepancy (2,654.4 lbs. or 20% of the declared weight of 13,272 lbs.) allowed
by the law.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the Collector of
Customs as affirmed by petitioner Commissioner of Customs, in accordance with
authority given them by the cited codal provision, duly exercised the
discretion and au­thority vested in them by imposing the maximum fine due to
the gross underdeclaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without a
showing of grave abuse of discretion on the part of said officials, the said
fine should be allowed to stand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applying by analogy the principles of penal law, the gross
underdeclaration (by more than 400%) aggravated respondent's offense and no
mitigating circumstance having been shown by respondent, petitioner correctly
imposed the maximum fine and there is no valid justification for respondent
court's arbitrary reduction of the fine to a mere P6,000.00.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clear purpose of the
codal provision requiring vessels to declare the correct weight of their cargo
is to curb smuggling due to such underdeclarations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, imposing the maximum fine on vessels
which grossly fail to comply with the obligation to declare the true weight of
their cargo promotes the spirit and purpose of the law, since imposing a
minimum fine would only embolden would-be smugglers and foster gross negligence
on the part of the master of the vessel as in this case in checking the true
weight of the cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents' claim
that there could be no evasion of duties here since textile remnants are
imposed duties <u>ad valorem</u> or on the basis of the dutiable value of the
merchandise irrespective of the weight is untenable, since an underdeclaration
of the weight of the remnants by more than 400% would make it much easier to
underdeclare the dutiable value of the remnants.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Solicitor
General's submission in his brief on behalf of petitioner commissioner that
respondent court "should have taken cognizance of the fact that a string
of cases have been filed with it, either already decided or pending decision,
involving similar violations committed by the same shipping agent, the private
respondent herein, such as C.T.A. Cases Nos. 2729, 2539, 2548, 2802, 2793, not
to include similar cases still pending with the Bureau of Customs, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Customs Cases Nos. 77-31, 77-32, 77-33,
75-21, 75-65, 75-65A, 75-04, which circumstance indubitably establishes
'habituality' in the commission of the same offense and, on this basis, the
maximum fine provided for by law should rightly be imposed," ap­pears to
be well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of such
numerous cases of similar violations having been decided against respondent or
pending decision against it has not been denied by respondent in its comment.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, contrary to
respondent's contention, the vessel's master, owner or employees are duty bound
under the cited codal sec­tion under pain of the penalty of fine therein
provided to check and verify the correct weight of the cargo or shipment so as
to prevent a misdeclaration or underdeclaration of weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vessel master's discharge of such
obligation imposed by law to properly determine and verify the weight of cargos
carried by it is certainly pertinent to and important for the proper assessment
of the collectible customs duties and taxes, and is not a burdensome task in
the present era of contain­erized cargos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As ruled by respondent court itself in its decision:</p>

<blockquote>"We find petitioner's contention without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue in this case and the arguments
raised are not of first impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the case of International Harvester Macleod, Inc., etc. vs. Commissioner of
Customs, C.T.A. Case No. 2698, <st1:date year="1977" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1977</st1:date>, this Court held as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">At this juncture, it is hardly necessary to add that under Section
2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code, the declaration, ascertainment or
verification of the correct weight of the cargo at the port of loading is the
duty or obligation of the master, pilot, owner, officer or employee of the
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he omits or disregards this
duty and a punishable discrepancy between the declared weight and actual weight
of the cargo exists, the inevitable conclusion is that he is negligent or
careless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Delgado Shipping Agencies,
Inc. vs. Commissioner of Customs, C.T.A. Case No. 2685, Feb. 15, 1977;
Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Commissioner of Customs, C.T.A. Case No. 2741,
Feb. 3, 1977; Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Com­missioner of Customs, C.T.A.
Case No. 2656, January 21, 1977 and cases cited therein.) Similarly, if in the
exercise or performance of this duty, he is negligent or careless resulting in
the commission of ex­cessive discrepancy in the weight of the ship's cargo
penalized under the law, care­lessness or incompetency is, nonetheless,
imputable to him.</p>

<p class="2Q">Thus, in the case of Delgado Shipping Agencies, Inc. vs.
Commissioner of Customs, C.T.A. Case No. 2685, <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="2">Feb­ruary 15, 1977</st1:date>, <i>certiorari</i> denied, G.R.
L-46262, <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1977</st1:date>, this
Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q">And as to petitioner's insistence of proof on the part of
respondent of the neg­ligence or carelessness of the master, owner or employee
of the vessel, suffice it to say, additionally, that this Court has already
unequivocably ruled that under Section 2523 of the Code, the ascertainment or
verification of the weight of the ship's cargo at the port of loading is the
duty or obligation of the master, pilot, owner or employee of the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing thus, the conclusion seems to be
inevitable that there is an unexcusable laxity on the part of the master or
owner in exercising the ordinary care and prudence in the commission of
excessive discrepancy in the weight of the ship's cargo penalized under the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doing business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
it behooves the master or owner of a vessel to abide by our customs laws and
regulations and to ignore them is nothing short of gross carelessness or
incompetence."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, judgment is hereby rendered modifying the
decision of respondent court by set­ting aside the reduction in fine therein
granted and reinstating the administrative fine of P26,575.00 imposed in
petitioner commissioner’s decision.</p>
