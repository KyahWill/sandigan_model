				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eguia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dumapig</span> and others were charged with murder, with
assault upon an agent of a person in authority, before the Court of First
Instance of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:place></st1:city>
in <span class="GramE">an amended</span> information filed therewith by City
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Gador</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were tried upon a plea of not guilty,
the prosecution having rested its case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the defense filed a motion to dismiss the case upon the
ground that the guilt of the defendants had not been established beyond
reasonable doubt, but the respondent judge denied the motion in his order of <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1965</st1:date>, which also set
the case for the continuation of the trial on October 7 to 9 of the same
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the defense filed a
motion to postpone the continuation of the trial upon the ground that the
transcript of the stenographic notes taken of the testimony of the prosecution
witnesses was not yet available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
motion was apparently granted because the continuation of the trial was reset
for October 25 to 27 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel for the defendants again filed a motion to postpone the same
upon exactly the same ground and the trial was again reset for continuation on
November 17, 1965, with the warning that no further postponement would be
granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 14, 1965, however, apparently upon the instance of
the court itself, the case was postponed again to December 14 to 16, 1965 in
view of the fact that stenographer <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> had not
yet been able to transcribe his notes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court, however, warned the parties - particularly the defense - that
no further postponement would be granted, and, in fact, denied the latter’s
motion for an indefinite postponement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 15, 1965, petitioner filed the present petition for
certiorari and prohibition, with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction,
to prevent the respondent court from going ahead with the continuation of the
trial, claiming that the order of the respondent judge denying his motion for
an indefinite postponement of the trial or until the transcript of the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses has been filed in the record is illegal
because it violates his right to defend himself properly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was given due course and on the 17th of November
1965 We issued a temporary restraining order effective only up to and including
December 2 of the same year. Petitioner’s motion to extend the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the said restraining order until the present
case is decided was denied by <span class="GramE">Us</span> on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the continuation of the trial could
not be held below for the reason that the respondent judge filed an answer in
the present proceeding to which he attached and submitted to <span class="GramE">Us</span>
the entire record of the case, together with all the transcript of the
stenographic notes taken of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts above <span class="SpellE">setforth</span>, it is
clear that the petition under consideration has absolutely no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No legal provision <span class="GramE">We</span>
are aware of supports petitioner’s view that before an accused in a criminal
case may be compelled to produce his evidence, the transcript of the
stenographic notes taken of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses must be
made available to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, it is obvious that it is the duty of his counsel to take notes
whether complete or incomplete, of the testimony of said witnesses in order to
be in a position to present whatever evidence, in his opinion, is necessary to
prove the innocence of his client.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the issue under consideration, all that the
defendant in a criminal case is entitled to under the Rules is two days after
arraignment to prepare <span class="GramE">himself</span> for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, petitioner has enjoyed and more.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition under consideration is dismissed
and the writs therein prayed for denied, with costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let the records of Criminal Case No. OZ-230,
elevated to this Court by the respondent judge <span class="GramE">be</span>
remanded to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span>
City for the immediate continuation of the trial.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
