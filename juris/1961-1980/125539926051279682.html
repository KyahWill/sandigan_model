				<H3>MD TRANSIT & TAXI CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. SANTIAGO PEPITO, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Santiago Pepito seeks to operate a TPU auto-truck service for the 
transportation of passengers and freight on the line Meycauayan 
(Bulacan)-Baclaran (Rizal) passing through Bonifacio monument and Highway 54, 
intending to use therefor six auto-trucks to be operated in accordance with the 
proposed time schedule attached to his application.<p></p>
<p>To his application several. operators filed oppositions notably the MD 
Transit &amp; Taxi Co. Inc., Jose de la Paz, operator of the Marikina Valley 
Transportation Co., Inc. Fortunato F. Halili and the La Mallorca-Pambusco 
combine.</p>
<p>On August 31, 1959, after due hearing, the Public Service Commission rendered 
decision finding that public convenience will be promoted in a proper and 
suitable manner by the approval of the application of Santiago Pepito who is 
financially capable of operating and maintaining the proposed service and so it 
ordered that a certificate of public convenience be granted him to operate six 
auto-trucks on the line applied for subject to the conditions therein 
specified.</p>
<p>From this decision only oppositor MD Transit &amp; Taxi Co., Inc. has 
appealed, and among the errors it now assigns in support of the reversal of the 
decision are: (1) in finding that "there is a need for the service applied for", 
when in fact the same is not supported reasonably by sufficient evidence; (2) in 
finding that the evidence of the applicant clearly shows that there is big 
volume of passengers between Meycauayan and Baclaran, such evidence, on the 
contrary, being not only hazy but contradictory to the finding of the 
Commission; (3) in disregarding the evidence of oppositor La Mallorca-Pambusco 
that its service from Meycauayan to Manila is adequate; and (4) in ruling that 
no evidence was presented by the oppositors that the approval of the application 
would result in ruinous and wasteful competition.</p>
<p>The contention that the finding of the Commission that "there is a need for 
the service applied for" is not reasonably supported by the evidence is 
untenable, for the same is belied by the record. Thus, the record shows that 
during the hearing the applicant presented a total of five witnesses, besides 
his own testimony, and predicated on such evidence the Commission found the 
following facts: that Meycauayan is a first class-B municipality with an 
estimated population of 30,000; that there are many passengers traveling along 
the line applied for; that the people traveling from Meycauayan in order to go 
to Baclaran, or any point in Highway 54, have to go as far as Bonifacio monument 
only, where they avail themselves of other transportation facilities to reach 
their destination; that, likewise, from Baclaran, or any point in Highway 54, 
the passengers have also to transfer to other means of transportation at 
Bonifacio monument in order to go to Meycauayan; that these passengers consist 
of merchants, peddlers, jewelry dealers and those engaged in wooden shoe 
business, bolo making and blacksmith; that these passengers upon arrival at 
Bonifacio monument usually have to wait for at least half hour before they could 
be accommodated because most of the buses there are already full, and that there 
had been petitions made by the people of Meycauayan, thru their mayor, asking 
that they be provided with transportation facilities from Meycauayan to 
Baclaran, via Highway 54, as in fact a petition to that effect was coursed thru 
the municipal council of said municipality, while applicant himself testified 
that there is no direct service from Meycauayan to Baclaran via Highway 54, and 
vice-versa, and that he is financially capable of operating the proposed 
service.</p>
<p>The above facts were found by the Commission after a careful evaluation of 
the evidence submitted by the applicant and so it is incorrect to say that its 
finding that there is need for the service applied for is not reasonably 
supported by sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>It is true that the oppositors tried to establish the contrary by impressing 
upon the Commission that the lines they were operating are sufficient to take 
care of the passengers, if any, on the new line applied for, to the extent that 
at times their buses were operating only with few, if not half full of, 
passengers, except on Wednesday, when there is pilgrimage in Baclaran church, 
when the buses become filled to capacity, aside from the fact that there are 
other operators serving the line from Bonifacio monument to Baclaran, via 
Highway 54, not to mention other TPU jeepneys and auto-trucks plying the same 
route. But the Commission did not give much importance to this opposition not 
only because the proposed line is not covered by the certificate granted to the 
oppositors but also because of the strength and merit of the very evidence of 
the applicant. Thus, after a careful evaluation of the evidence of the 
applicant, as well as the oppositors, the Commission made the following 
comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a careful consideration of the evidence presented by the parties, we 
find that there is need for the service applied for. Applicant's evidence on 
this point clearly shows that there is a big volume of passengers commuting 
between Meycauayan and Baclaran, especially on Wednesdays, when many residents 
of the former go to Baclaran and return on the same day. Oppositors' contention 
that present operators serving on the line Bonifacio Monument-Baclaran or 
Buendia via Highway 54 are more than sufficient to cope with the needs of the 
traveling public on the line can not be given much consideration as applicant in 
this case proposes a line from Baclaran to Meycauayan (Bulacan) and vice-versa, 
and intends to serve passengers coming from Meycauayan bound for Baclaran, or 
from Baclaran to Meycauayan. Besides, if this Commission were to grant the 
service, the same would be for the convenience of these passengers intended to 
be served as they do not have to make any transfers in order to reach their 
destination. It is to be noted that the line Bonifacio Monument-Baclaran or 
Buendia via Highway 54 where the oppositors, MD Transit and the Marikina Valley 
Transportation, are presently operating, is only a part of the 
Baclaran-Meycauayan line applied for by the applicant. As to the evidence 
adduced by the Pampanga Bus Co. and the La Mallorca to the effect that they are 
adequately serving passengers from Meycauayan can not likewise be given much 
weight as their operation is intended to serve passengers from said municipalty 
to Divisoria and vice-versa. We also find no merit in the documentary evidence 
presented by the oppositor Halili, as the decision denying its application 
rendered in Case No. 106835 et al.f refers to the line Navotas (Rizal-Las Pi√±as 
(Rizal), which is entirely different from that which applicant has applied for. 
No evidence was presented by the oppositors to support their contention that if 
applicant is granted a certificate of public convenience, the same would only 
cause ruinous and wasteful competition, and that applicant is not financially 
capable of operating and maintaining the proposed service."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is also true that an attempt was made on the part of the oppositors to 
show that some of the witnesses of the applicant have committed contradictions 
in their testimony, but besides the fact that the contradictions are 
insubstantial, they were explained by opposing counsel in his brief. We are 
satisfied that such contradictions have not materially impaired the essence of 
their testimony.</p>
<p>It appearing that the main issues raised by petitioner merely affect 
questions of fact which Jby their very nature involve an evaluation of the 
relative weight of the evidence of both parties, or the credibility of the 
witnesses who testified before the Commission, following the law and 
jurisprudence applicable to the matter in this jurisdiction, said questions are 
now conclusive upon this Court, and cannot be looked into, it appearing that 
there is sufficient evidence to support said findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>Another issue raised by petitioner refers to the finding that the oppositors 
failed to prove that the granting of the new line to the applicant would cause 
them ruinous and wasteful competition, citing in this respect the joint decision 
rendered in certain cases (Exhibit 1) wherein the Commission made the following 
remark: "With the existing service now authorized, these additional units will 
provide ample and sufficient service for the needs of the public in both lines 
and there will be no need for sometime to come to entertain applications for 
more service in either of these lines." It is emphasized that when this decision 
was rendered the application of herein respondent was then pending 
determination, and from this remark petitioner concludes that the grant of a new 
line, as the one granted to respondent, would necessarily result in a ruinous 
competition to the prejudice of the oppositors.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that the remark above adverted to was a mere<em> obiter 
dictum</em> for it is not within the competence of the Commission to determine 
whether or not additional service in the future will not be necessary on the 
basis of the present evidence for such matter can only be determined after 
hearing and proper determination of existing factual conditions that may warrant 
the need for additional service, the essence of the remark of the Commission has 
been virtually rendered ineffective when scarcely nine months thereafter the 
same Commission granted other applications to operate a line of auto-trucks on 
Highway 54, one of which is that of oppositor herein in Case No. 126816, wherein 
it was granted ten additional units alleging therein that there was further 
necessity for such additional units. The truth, however, is that the oppositors 
presented no evidence whatsoever to prove that the approval of respondent's 
application would result in a ruinous and wasteful competition. This it is their 
duty to do in line with what this Court has ruled on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * In order that the opposition based on ruinous competition may prosper, 
it must be shown that the opponent 'would be deprived of fair profits on the 
capital invested in its business. The mere possibility of reduction in the 
earnings of a business is not sufficient to prove ruinous competition. It must 
be shown that the business would not have sufficient gains to pay a fair rate of 
interest on its capital investment.' (Manila Electric Co., vs. Pasay 
Transportation Co., 66 Phil., 36, 6 L. J. 1117.) Mere allegations by the 
oppositor that its business would be ruined by the establishment of the ice 
plants proposed by the applicants 'are not sufficient to warrant this court to 
revoke the order of the Public Service Commission.' (Teodora Santos Vda. de 
Pilares vs. Consuelo Arranze, G. R. No. 45462, July 28, 1938.)" (Ice &amp; Cold 
Storage Industries vs. Valero, 85 Phil., 7)</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, we do not find merit in the contention that the Commission erred in 
not giving weight to the evidence of oppositor La Mallorca-Pambusco that it is 
adequately serving the passengers traveling between Meycauayan and Manila for 
the reason that the line applied for is entirely different from the route served 
by said oppositor.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
petitioner.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,
