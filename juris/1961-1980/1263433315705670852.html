genuine; and in the alternative</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> the same was not

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span>, at the time of
the alleged execution of the purported will, the decedent lacked testamentary
capacity due to old age and sickness; and in the second alternative</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> the purported
will was procured through undue and improper pressure and influence on the part
of the principal beneficiary, and/or of some other person for her benefit.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span> Santiago filed her Answer to

rendered judgment, the summary and <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portions of which read:</p>

<blockquote>"Passing in summary upon the grounds advanced by the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, this Court finds:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there is no iota of evidence to support
the contention that the purported will of the deceased was procured through
undue and improper pressure and influence on the part of the petitioner, or of
some other person for her benefit;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there is insufficient evidence to sustain
the contention that at the time of the alleged execution of the purported will,
the deceased lacked testamentary capacity due to old age and sickness;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That sufficient and abundant evidence warrants
conclusively the fact that the purported will of the deceased was not executed
and attested as required by law;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the evidence is likewise conclusive that
the document presented for probate, Exhibit 'F' is not the purported will
allegedly dictated by the deceased, executed and signed by her, and attested by
her three attesting witnesses on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April
 15, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, Exhibit 'F', the document presented for probate as
the last will and testament of the deceased Isabel Gabriel, is hereby
DISALLOWED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment of disallowance, <span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span>
Santiago appealed to respondent Court, hence, the only issue decided on appeal
was whether or not the will in question was executed and attested as required
by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, upon
consideration of the evidence adduced by both parties, rendered the decision
now under review, holding that the will in question was signed and executed by
the deceased Isabel Gabriel on April 15, 1961 in the presence of the three
attesting witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>, signing and witnessing the document in the

denied the motion for reconsideration stating that:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">oppositor-appellee</span> contends
that the preponderance of evidence shows that the supposed last will and
testament of Isabel Gabriel was not executed in accordance with law because the
same was signed on several occasions, that the testatrix did not sign the will
in the presence of all the instrumental witnesses, and that said instrumental
witnesses did not sign the will in the presence of each other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The resolution of the factual issue raised in the motion for
reconsideration hinges on the appreciation of the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have carefully re-examined the oral and
documentary evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no reason to alter the findings of fact in the decision of this Court sought to

<p class="BODY">In her petition before this Court, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> Gabriel Gonzales contends that respondent
Court abused its discretion and/or acted without or in excess of its
jurisdiction in reversing the findings of fact and conclusions of the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, after deliberating on
the petition but without giving due course resolved, in the Resolution dated
Oct. 11, 1973 to require the respondents to comment thereon, which comment was
filed on Nov. 14, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
consideration of the allegations, the issues raised and the arguments adduced

the question raised being factual and for insufficient showing that the

give due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner in her brief makes the following assignment of
errors:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court of Appeals erred in
holding that the document, Exhibit "F" was executed and attested as
required by law when there was abso­lutely no proof that the three instrumental
witnesses were credible witnesses.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the
finding of the lower court that the preparation and execution of the will
Exhibit "F", was unexpected and coincidental.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">III.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in finding that
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was not previously furnished with the
names and residence certificates of the witnesses as to enable him to type such
data into the document Exhibit "F".</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">IV.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in holding that
the fact that the three typewritten lines under the typewritten words "<span class="SpellE">Pangalan</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Tinitirahan</span>"
were left blank shows beyond cavil that the three attesting witnesses were all
present in the same occasion.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">V.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the
trial court's finding that it was incredible that Isabel Gabriel could have
dictated the will, Exhibit "F", without any note or document, to
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">VI.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the
finding of the trial court that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orubia</span> was not physically present when the will, Exhibit
"F" was allegedly signed on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April
 15, 1961</st1:date> by the deceased Isabel Gabriel and the other witnesses <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">VII.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in holding that
the trial court gave undue importance to the picture takings as proof that the
will was improperly executed.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">VIII.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the
grave contradictions, evasions, and misrepresentations of witnesses
(subscribing and notary) presented by the petitioner had been explained away,
and that the trial court erred in rejecting said testimonies.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">IX.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals acted in excess of its
appellate jurisdiction or has so far departed from the accepted and usual
course of judicial proceedings, as to call for an exercise of the power of
supervision.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">X.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the
decision of the trial court and admitting to probate Exhibit "F", the
alleged last will and testament of the deceased Isabel Gabriel.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted from the above assignments of errors that the
same are substantially factual in character and content.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, at the very outset, <span class="GramE">We</span>
must again state the oft-repeated and well-established rule that in this
jurisdiction, the factual findings of the Court of Appeals are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>, the same being binding and conclusive on this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule has been stated and
reiterated in a long line of cases enumerated in <u>Chan vs. CA</u> (L-27488,

case of <u>Chan vs. CA</u>, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> from <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Mayuga</span>, a 1936 decision, the opinion being penned by the
then Justice Recto, it has been well-settled that the jurisdiction of this
Court in cases brought to us from the Court of Appeals is limited to reviewing
and revising the errors of law imputed to it, its findings of fact being
conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, in a
decision exactly a month later, this Court, speaking through the then Justice
Laurel, it was held that the same principle is applicable, even if the Court of
Appeals was in disagreement with the lower court as to the weight of the
evidence with a consequent reversal of its findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Stated otherwise, findings of facts by the Court of Appeals, when
supported by substantive evi­dence are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
on appeal by certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said findings
of the appellate court are final and cannot be disturbed by <span class="GramE">Us</span>
particularly because its premises are borne out by the record or based upon
substantial evidence and what is more, when such findings are correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assignments of errors involving factual
issues cannot be ventilated in a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals
because only legal questions may be raised.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Supreme Court is not at liberty to alter or modify the facts as set
forth in the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to be reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the findings of the Court of Appeals
are contrary to those of the trial court, a minute scrutiny by the Supreme
Court is in order, and resort to duly-proven evidence becomes necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general rule <span class="GramE">We</span>
have thus stated above is not without some recognized exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having laid down the above legal precepts as <span class="GramE">Our</span>
foundation, We now proceed to consider petitioner's assignments of errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in her first assignment, contends that the respondent
Court of Appeals erred in holding that the document, Exhibit "F", was
executed and attested as required by law when there was absolutely no proof
that the three instrumental witnesses were credible witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She argues that the requirement in Article
806, Civil Code, that the witnesses must be credible is an absolute requirement
which must be complied with before an alleged last will and testament may be
admitted to probate and that to be a credible witness, there must be evidence
on record that the witness has a good standing in his community, or that he is
honest and upright, or reputed to be trustworthy and reliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner, unless the
qualifications of the witness are first established, his testimony may not be
favorably considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
contends that the term "credible" is not syno­nymous with
"competent" for a witness may be competent under Article 820 and 821
of the Civil Code and still not be credible as required by Article 805 of the
same Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further urged that the
term "credible" as used in the Civil Code should receive the same
settled and well-known meaning it has under the Naturalization Law, the latter
being a kindred legislation with the Civil Code provisions on wills with
respect to the qualifications of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit to petitioner's first assignment of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 820 of the Civil Code provides the
qualifications of a witness to the execution of wills while Article 821 sets
forth the disqualification from being a witness to a will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These Articles state:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 820.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person
of sound mind and of the age of eighteen years or more, and not blind, deaf or
dumb, and able to read and write, may be a witness to the execution of a will
mentioned in article 805 of this Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 821.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following are disqualified from being witnesses to a will:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any person not domiciled in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><span class="GramE">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those who have been convicted of
falsification of a document, perjury or false testimony."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the law, there is no mandatory requirement that the witness
testify initially or at any time during the trial as to his good standing in
the com­munity, his reputation for trustworthiness and <span class="SpellE">reliableness</span>,
his honesty and uprightness in order that his testimony may be believed and
accepted by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
enough that the qualifications enumerated in Article 820 of the Civil Code are
complied with, such that the soundness of his mind can be shown by or deduced
from his answers to the questions propounded to him, that his age (18 years or
more) is shown from his appearance, testimony, or competently proved otherwise,
as well as the fact that he is not blind, deaf or dumb and that he is able to
read and write to the satisfaction of the Court, and that he has none of the
disqualifications under Article 821 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reject petitioner's contention that it
must first be established in the record the good standing of the witness in the
community, his reputation for trustworthi­ness and <span class="SpellE">reliableness</span>,
his honesty and uprightness, because such attributes are presumed of the
witness unless the contrary is proved otherwise by the opposing party.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also reject as without merit petitioner's contention that the
term "credible" as used in the Civil Code should be given the same
meaning it has under the Naturalization Law where the law is mandatory that the
petition for naturalization must be supported by two character witnesses who
must prove their good standing in the community, reputation for trustworthiness
and <span class="SpellE">reliableness</span>, their honesty and uprightness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two witnesses in a petition for
naturalization are character witnesses in that being citizens of the Philippines,
they personally know the petitioner to be a resident of the Philippines for the
period of time required by the Act and a person of good repute and morally
irreproachable and that said petitioner has in their opinion all the
qualifications necessary to become a citizen of the Philippines and is not in
any way disqualified under the provisions of the Naturalization Law (Section 7,
Commonwealth Act No. 473 as amended).</p>

<p class="BODY">In probate proceedings, the instrumental witnesses are not
character witnesses for they merely attest the execution of a will or testament
and affirm the formalities attendant to said execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with
the respondent that the rulings laid down in the cases cited by petitioner
concerning character witnesses in naturalization proceedings are not applicable
to instrumental witnesses to wills executed under the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the finding that each and everyone of the
three instrumental witnesses, namely, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>, are competent and credible is
satisfactorily supported by the evidence as found by the respondent Court of
Appeals, which findings of fact this Tribunal is bound to accept and rely
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner has not
pointed to any disqualification of any of the said witnesses, much less has it
been shown that anyone of them is below 18 years of age, of unsound mind, deaf
or dumb, or cannot read or write.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that under Article 805 of the New Civil Code, every
will, other than a holographic will, must be subscribed at the end thereof by
the testator himself or by the testator's name written by some other person in
his presence, and by his express direction, and attested and subscribed by
three or more <u>credible</u> witnesses in the presence of the testator and of
one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the petitioner
submits that Article 820 and 821 of the New Civil Code speak of the <u>competency
of a witness</u> due to his qualifications under the first Article and none of
the disqualifications under the second Article, whereas Article 805 requires
the attestation of three or more credible witnesses, petitioner concludes that
the term <u>credible</u> requires something more than just being <u>competent</u>
and, therefore, a witness in addition to being competent under Articles 820 and
821 must also be a credible witness under Article 805.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner cites American authorities that competency and
credibility of a witness are not synonymous terms and one may be a competent
witness and yet not a credible one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
exacerbates that there is no evidence on record to show that the instrumental
witnesses are credible in themselves, that is, that they are of good standing
in the community since one was a family driver by profession and the second the
wife of the driver, a housekeeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
true that <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> was
the driver of the testatrix and his wife Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>,
merely a housekeeper, and that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> was a piano teacher to a grandchild of the
testatrix.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the relation of employer
and employee much less the humble social or financial <span class="GramE">position
of a person do</span> not disqualify him to be a competent testamentary
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Molo-Pekson</span> and Perez-<span class="SpellE">Nable</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tanchuco</span>, et al., 100 Phil. 344; Testate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Off.</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., <st1:date year="1941" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1941</st1:date>, p. 788).</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent maintains that the qualifi­cations of the
three or more credible witnesses mentioned in Article 805 of the Civil Code are
those mentioned in Article 820 of the same Code, this being obvious from that
portion of Article 820 which says "may be a witness to the execution of a
will mentioned in Article 805 of this Code," and cites authorities that
the word "credible" insofar as witnesses to a will are concerned
simply means "competent." Thus, in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Suntay</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span></u>, 95 Phil. 500, the Supreme Court held
that "Granting that a will was duly executed and that it was in existence
at the time of, and not revoked before, the death of the testator, still the
provisions of the lost will must be clearly and distinctly proved by at least
two credible witnesses<span class="GramE">. '<u>Credible witnesses' mean
competent witnesses and not those who testify to facts from or upon hearsay</u>."</span>
(<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Molo-Pekson</u></span><u> and Perez-<span class="SpellE">Nable</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tanchuco</span>, et al</u>.,
100 Phil. 344, the Supreme Court held that "Section 620 of the same Code
of Civil Procedure provides that any person of sound mind, and of the age of
eighteen years or more, and not blind, deaf, or dumb and able to read and
write, may be a witness to the execution of a will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This same provision is reproduced in our New
Civil Code of 1950, under Art. 820.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
relation of employer and employee, or being a relative to the beneficiary in a
will, does not disqualify one to be a witness to a will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main qualification of a witness in the
attestation of wills, if other qualifications as to age, mental capacity and
literacy are present, is that said witness must be credible, that is to say,
his testimony may be entitled to credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a long line of authorities on this point, a few of which <span class="GramE">We</span> may cite:</p>

<blockquote>"The term 'credible', used in the statute of wills requiring
that a will shall be attested by two credible witnesses means competent;
witnesses who, at the time of attesting the will, are legally competent to

&amp; Trust Co., 152 N.E. 545, 546, 322 III.</span> 42." (Ibid. p. 343)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the strict sense, the competency of a person to be an
instrumental witness to a will is determined by the <span class="GramE">statute,
that</span> is Art. 820 and 821, Civil Code, whereas his credibility depends on
the appreciation of his testimony and arises from the belief and conclusion of
the Court that said witness is telling the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Aroyo</span>

No. L-22005, <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1968</st1:date>,
the Supreme Court held and ruled that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Competency as a witness is one thing, and it is another to be a
credible witness, so credible that the Court must accept what he says.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial courts may allow a person to testify as
a witness upon a given matter because he is competent, but may thereafter
decide whether to believe or not to believe his testimony."</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, We state the rule that the instrumental witnesses in
order to be competent must be shown to have the qualifications under Article
820 of the Civil Code and none of the disqualifications under Article 821 and
for their testimony to be credible, that is worthy of belief and entitled to
credence, it is not mandatory that evidence be first established on record that
the witnesses have a good standing in the community or that they are honest and
upright or reputed to be trustworthy and reliable, for a person is presumed to
be such unless the contrary is established otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the instrumental witnesses
must be competent and their testimonies must be credible before the court
allows the probate of the will they have attested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, therefore, reject petitioner's position
that it was fatal for respondent not to have introduced prior and independent
proof of the fact that the witnesses were "credible witnesses", that
is, that they have a good standing in the community and reputed to be
trustworthy and reliable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth
assignments of errors, petitioner disputes the findings of fact of the
respondent court in finding that the preparation and execution of the will was
expected and not coincidental, in finding that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>
was not previously furnished with the names and residence certificates of the
witnesses as to enable him to type such data into the document Exhibit
"F", in holding that the fact that the three typewritten lines under
the typewritten words "<span class="SpellE">pangalan</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">tinitirahan</span>" were left blank shows beyond cavil that
the three attesting witnesses were all present in the same occasion, in holding
credible that Isabel Gabriel could have dictated the will without note or
document to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>, in holding that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> was physically
present when the will was signed on April 15, 1961 by the deceased Isabel
Gabriel and the other witnesses <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>, in
holding that the trial court gave undue importance to the picture takings as
proof that the will was improperly executed, and in holding that the grave
contradictions, evasions and misrepresentations of the witnesses (subscribing
and notary) presented by the petitioner had been explained away.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the above errors are factual, <span class="GramE">We</span>
must repeat what We have previously laid down that the findings of fact of the
appellate court are binding and controlling which We cannot review, subject to
certain exceptions which We will consider and discuss hereinafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are convinced that the appellate court's
findings are sufficiently justified and supported by the evidence on
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the alleged unnaturalness
characterizing the trip of the testatrix to the office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> and bringing all the witnesses without previous
appoint­ment for the preparation and execution of the will and that it was
coincidental that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was available at the
moment impugns the finding of the Court of Appeals that although Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> admitted the visit of Isabel Gabriel and of her
companions to his office on April 15, 1961 was unexpected as there was no prior
appointment with him, but he explained that he was available for any business
transaction on that day and that Isabel Gabriel had earlier requested him to
help her prepare her will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finding
of the appellate court is amply based on the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> that he was not only informed on the morning
of the day that he witnessed the will but that it was the third time when
Isabel Gabriel told him that he was going to witness the making of her will, as
well as the testimony of Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> that she was
called by her husband <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
to proceed to Isabel Gabriel's house which was nearby and from said house, they
left in a car to the lawyer's office, which testimonies are recited in the
respondent Court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court further found the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and his wife Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
obtained residence certificates a few days before Exhibit "F" was
executed. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gimpaya's</span> residence certificate <span class="GramE">No</span>.
A-5114942 was issued at <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1961</st1:date> while
Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya's</span> residence certificate <span class="GramE">No</span>. A-5114974 was issued also at <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
Court correctly observed that there was nothing surprising in these facts and
that the securing of these residence certificates two days and one day,
respectively, before the execution of the will on April 15, 1961, far from
showing an amazing coincidence, reveals that the spouses were earlier notified
that they would be witnesses to the execution of Isabel Gabriel's will.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also agree with the respondent Court's conclusion that the
excursion to the office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was planned
by the deceased, which conclusion was correctly drawn from the testimony of the
<span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> spouses that they started from the <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span> residence of the deceased with a photographer and
Isabel Gabriel herself, then they proceeded by car to <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orobia's</span> house in <span class="SpellE">Philamlife</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City to fetch her and from there, all the
three witnesses (the <span class="SpellE">Gimpayas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>)
passed by a place where Isabel Gabriel stayed for about ten to fifteen minutes
at the clinic of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Chikiamco</span> before they proceeded
to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Paraiso's</span>
office.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also evident from the records, as testified to by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> that previous to the day that the will was executed
on April 15, 1961, Isabel Gabriel had requested him to help her in the
execution of her will and that he told her that if she really wanted to execute
her will, she should bring with her at least the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and a Councilor to be her witnesses and that he
(Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>) wanted a medical certificate from a
physician notwithstanding the fact that he believed her to be of sound and <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
this evidence, the appellate court rightly concluded, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is, therefore, clear that the
presence of Isabel Gabriel and her witnesses <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> including the photographer in the
law office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was not coincidental as
their gathering was pre-arranged by Isabel Gabriel herself."</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the appellate court's finding that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was not previously furnished with the names and
residence certificates of the witnesses as to enable him to type such data into
the document Exhibit "F", which the petitioner assails as
contradictory and irreconcilable with the statement of the Court that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was handed a list (containing the names of the
witnesses and their respective residence certificates) immediately upon their
arrival in the law office by Isabel Gabriel and this was corroborated by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> himself who testified that it was only on said
occasion that he received such list from Isabel Gabriel, We cannot agree with
petitioner's contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no
contradiction for the respondent Court held that on the occasion of the
will-making on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date>,
the list was given immediately to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> and
that no such list was given the lawyer in any previous occasion or date prior
to <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But whether Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was
previously furnished with the names and residence certificates of the wit­nesses
on a prior occasion or on the very occasion and date in April 15, 1961 when the
will was executed, is of no moment for such data appear in the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> acknowledgment of Notary Public <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>, subscribed and
sworn to by the witnesses on April 15, 1961 following the attestation clause
duly executed and signed on the same occasion, April 15, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since Exhibit "F" is a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> will duly acknowledged by the testatrix and the
witnesses before a notary public, the same is a public document executed and
attested through the intervention of the notary public and as such public
document is evidence of the facts in clear, unequivocal manner therein
expressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has in its favor the presumption
of regularity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To contradict all these,
there must be evidence that is clear, convincing and more than merely
preponderant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Yturalde</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Azurin</span>, 28 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
407).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no such evidence pointed
by petitioner in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the conclusion of the Court of Appeals in holding that
the fact that the three typewritten lines under the typewritten words "<span class="SpellE">pangalan</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">tinitirahan</span>"
were left blank shows beyond cavil that the three attesting witnesses were all
present in the same occasion merits Our approval because this conclusion is
supported and borne out by the evidence found by the appellate court,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On page 5 of Exhibit
"F", beneath the typewritten words "names", "Res. Tax
Cert.", "date issued" and "place issued" the only name
of Isabel Gabriel with Residence Tax Certificate No. A-5113274 issued on <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1961</st1:date> at <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> appears to be in
typewritten form while the names, residence tax certificate numbers, dates and
places of issuance of said certificates pertaining to the three (3) witnesses
were personally handwritten by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, this coincides with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso's</span> testimony that he had earlier advised Isabel
Gabriel to bring with her at least the Mayor and a Councilor of <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to be her
witnesses for he did not know beforehand the identities of the three attesting
witnesses until the latter showed up at his law office with Isabel Gabriel on
April 15, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso's</span> claim--which was not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
that he wrote down in his own hand the date appearing on page 5 of Exhibit
"F" dissipates any lingering doubt that he prepared and ratified the
will on the date in question."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also a factual finding of the Court of Appeals in holding
that it was credible that Isabel Gabriel could have dictated the will, Exhibit
"F", without any note or document to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>
as against the contention of petitioner that it was incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling of the respondent court is fully
supported by the evidence on record as stated in the decision under review,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nothing in the record
supports the trial court's unbelief that Isabel Gabriel dictated her will
without any note or document to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, all the three attesting
witnesses uniformly testified that Isabel Gabriel dictated her will to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> and that other than the piece of paper that she
handed to said lawyer she had no note or document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact jibes with the evidence--which the
trial court itself believed was unshaken--that Isabel Gabriel was of sound
disposing memory when she executed her will.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit "F" reveals only seven (7) dispositions which
are not complicated but quite simple.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first was Isabel Gabriel's wish to be interred according to Catholic
rites; the second was a general directive to pay her debts if any; the third
provided for P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for her sister <span class="SpellE">Praxides</span> Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Santiago
and P2,000.00 for her brother Santiago Gabriel; the fourth was a listing of her
13 nephews and nieces including <span class="SpellE">oppositor-appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> Gabriel and the amount for each legatee; the fifth
was the institution of the petitioner-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span>
Santiago as the principal heir mentioning in general terms seven (7) types of properties;
the sixth disposed of the remainder of her estate which she willed in favor of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span> Santiago but prohibiting the sale
of such properties to anyone except in extreme situations in which even the
sale must be made to close relatives; and the seventh was the appointment of
the appellant Santiago as executrix of the will without bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The technical description of the properties
in paragraph 5 of Exhibit F was not given and the numbers of the certificates
of title were only supplied by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in one disposition, the numbers of the Torrens
titles of the properties disposed and the docket number of a special proceeding
are indicated which Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> candidly admitted
were supplied by him, whereupon petitioner contends that it was incredible that
Isabel Gabriel could have dictated the will Exhibit "F" without any
note or document to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>, considering that
Isabel Gabriel was an old and sickly woman more than eighty-one years old and
had been suffering from a brain injury caused by two severe blows at her head
and died of terminal cancer a few weeks after the execution of Exhibit
"F".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While We can rule that
this is a finding of fact which is within the competency of the respondent
appellate court in determining the testamentary capacity of the testatrix and
is, therefore, beyond Our power to revise and review, We nevertheless hold that
the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals that the testatrix dictated her
will without any note or memorandum appears to be fully supported by the following
facts or evidence appearing on record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Isabel Gabriel, despite her age, was particularly active in her
business affairs as she actively managed the affairs of the movie business <span class="SpellE">Isabelita</span> Theater, paying the <span class="SpellE">aparatistas</span>
herself until <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1961</st1:date>,
3 days before her death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was the
widow of the late <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> Naval, former Governor of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Province and acted as co-<span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
in the Intestate Estate of her deceased husband <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>
Naval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The text of the will was in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, a dialect known and understood by her and in the
light of all the circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with the
respondent Court that the testatrix dictated her will without any note or
memorandum, a fact unanimously testified to by the three attesting witnesses
and the notary public himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's sixth assignment of error is also bereft of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, both testimonial
and documentary is, according to the respondent court, overwhelming that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> was physically
present when the will was signed on April 15, 1961 by the testa­trix and the
other two witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such factual finding of the appellate court is very clear, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On the contrary, the record is replete
with proof that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>
was physically present when the will was signed by Isabel Gabriel on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date> along with her
co-witnesses <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court's conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Orobia's</span>
admission that she gave piano lessons to the child of the appellant on
Wednesdays and Saturdays and that April 15, 1961 happened to be a Saturday for
which reason <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> could not have been present to
witness the will on that day--is purely conjectural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> did
not admit having given piano lessons to the appellant's child every Wednesday and
Saturday without fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is highly
probable that even if <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date>
were a Saturday, she gave no piano lessons on that day for which reason she
could have witnessed the execution of the will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> spoke of occasions when she missed
giving piano lessons and had to make up for the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, her presence at the law office of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> was in the morning of <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date> and there was nothing
to preclude her from giving piano lessons on the afternoon of the same day in <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> was present on April 15, 1961 and that she signed
the attestation clause to the will and on the left-hand margin of each of the
pages of the will, the documentary evidence which is the will itself, the
attestation clause and the <span class="SpellE">nota­rial</span> acknowledgment
overwhelmingly and convincingly prove such fact that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> was present on that day of April 15, 1961 and
that she witnessed the will by signing her name thereon and acknowledged the
same before the notary public, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attestation
clause which <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>
signed is the best evi­dence as to the date of signing because it preserves in
permanent form a recital of all the material facts attending the execution of
the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the very purpose of
the attestation clause which is made for the purpose of preserving in permanent
form, a record of the facts attending the execution of the will, so that in
case of failure in the memory of the subscribing wit­nesses, or other casualty
they may still be proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Thompson on Wills, 2nd ed., Sec. 132; <span class="SpellE">Leynez</span>

<p class="BODY">As to the seventh error assigned by petitioner faulting the Court
of Appeals in holding that the trial court gave undue importance to the
picture-takings as proof that the will was improperly executed, We agree with
the reasoning of the respondent court that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia's</span>
identification of the photographer as "Cesar Mendoza", contrary to
what the other two witnesses (<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>) and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> said
that the photo­grapher was Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cifra</span>, Jr., is at
worst a minor mistake attributable to lapse of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not require a photographer for
the execution and attestation of the will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that Miss <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> mistakenly iden­tified
the photographer as Cesar Mendoza scarcely detracts from her testimony that she
was present when the will was signed because what matters here is not the
photographer but the photograph taken which clearly portrays <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> herself, her
co-witnesses <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>, Isabel Gabriel and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>." Further, the respondent Court correctly
held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The trial court gave undue
importance to the picture-takings, jumping <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
to the conclusion that the will was improperly executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, however, heavily points to only
one occasion of the execution of the will on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date> which was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These witnesses were quite emphatic and
positive when they spoke of this occasion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, their identification of some photographs wherein they all
appeared along with Isabel Gabriel and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>
was superfluous."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Continuing, the respondent
Court declared:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is true that
the second picture-taking was disclosed at the cross examination of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this was explained by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> as a reenactment of the first incident upon the
insistence of Isabel Gabriel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
reenactment where <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>
was admittedly no longer present was wholly unnecessary if not pointless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was important was that the will was duly
executed and witnessed on the first occasion on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date>," and <span class="GramE">We</span>
agree with the Court's rationalization in conformity with logic, law and
jurisprudence which do not require picture-taking as one of the legal
requisites for the execution or probate of a will.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner points to alleged grave contradictions, evasions and
misrepresentations of witnesses in their respective testimonies before the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
respondent Court of Appeals held that said contradictions, evasions and
misrepresentations had been explained away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such discrepancies as in the description of the typewriter used by Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> which he described as "elite" which
to him meant big letters which are of the type in which the will was
typewritten but which was identified by witness Jolly <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span>
of the <span class="SpellE">N.B.I</span>. as "pica", the mistake in mentioning
the name of the photographer by <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> to be Cesar Mendoza when actually it was Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cifra</span>, Jr.-- these are indeed unimportant details which
could have been affected by the lapse of time and the treachery of human memory
such that by themselves would not alter the probative value of their
testimonies on the true execution of the will, (<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, 28 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 421,
424) for it cannot be expected that the testimony of every person will be
identical and coinciding with each other with regard to details of an incident
and that witnesses are not expected to remember all details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Human <span class="GramE">experience teach</span>
us "that contradictions of witnesses generally occur in the details of
certain incidents, after a long series of questionings, and far from being an
evidence of falsehood constitute a demonstration of good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as not all those who witness an
incident are impressed in like manner, it is but natural that in relating their
impressions, they should not agree in the minor details; hence the
contradictions in their testimony." (Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Liboro</span>,
81 Phil. 429).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged of <span class="GramE">Us</span> by the petitioner that
the findings of the trial court should not have been dis­turbed by the
respondent appellate court because the trial court was in a better position to
weigh and evaluate the evidence presented in the course of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, petitioner is correct but
it is subject to well-established exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right of the Court of Appeals to review, alter and reverse the
findings of the trial court where the appellate court, in reviewing the
evidence has found that facts and circumstances of weight and influence have
been ignored and overlooked and the significance of which have been
misinterpreted by the trial court, cannot be disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Findings of facts made by trial courts
particularly when they are based on conflicting evidence whose evaluation
hinges on questions of credibility of contending <span class="GramE">witnesses</span>
lies peculiarly within the province of trial courts and generally, the
appellate court should not interfere with the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, however, the Court of
Appeals found that the trial court had overlooked and misin­terpreted the facts
and circumstances established in the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whereas the appellate court said that "Nothing in the record
supports the trial court's unbelief that Isabel Gabriel dictated her will
without any note or document to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>;"
that the trial court's conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> could not have witnessed anybody signing the alleged
will or that she could not have witnessed <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> sign the
same or that she witnessed only the deceased signing it, is a conclusion based
not on facts but on inferences; that the trial court gave undue importance to
the picture-takings, jumping <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to the conclu­sion
that the will was improperly executed and that there is nothing in the entire
record to support the conclusion of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that the
will-signing occasion was a mere coincidence and that Isabel Gabriel made an
appointment only with <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>
to witness the signing of her will, then it becomes the duty of the appellate
court to reverse findings of fact of the trial court in the exercise of its
appellate jurisdiction over the lower courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still the petitioner insists that the case at bar is an exception
to the rule that the judgment of the Court of Appeals is conclusive as to the
facts and cannot be reviewed by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again We agree with the petitioner that among
the exceptions are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when the
conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures;
(2) when the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when
there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a
misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6)
when the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of
the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Buan</span>,

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's insistence is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the case at bar does not fall
within any of the exceptions enumerated above.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We likewise hold that the findings of fact of the respondent appellate
court are fully supported by the evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusions are fully sustained by
substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no abuse
of discretion and <span class="GramE">We</span> discern no misapprehension of
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court's findings of
fact are not conflicting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
well-established rule that the decision of the Court of Appeals and its
findings of fact are binding and conclusive and should not be disturbed by this
Tribunal and it must be applied in the case at bar in its full force and
effect, without qualification or reservation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The above holding simply synthesizes the resolutions <span class="GramE">We</span>
have heretofore made in respect to petitioner's previous assignments of error
and to which We have disagreed and, therefore, rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last assignments of error of petitioner must necessarily be
rejected by Us as We find the respondent Court acted properly and correctly and
has not departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings as
to call for the exercise of the power of supervision by the Supreme Court, and
as We find that the Court of Appeals did not err in reversing the decision of
the trial court and admitting to probate Exhibit "F", the last will
and testament of the deceased Isabel Gabriel.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule that the respondent Court's factual findings upon its
summation and evaluation of the evidence on record is unassailable that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"From the welter of evidence presented,
we are convinced that the will in question was executed on April 15, 1961 in
the presence of <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> signing and witnessing the same in the presence of
each other as required by law." Specifically, We affirm that on April 15,
1961 the testatrix Isabel Gabriel, together with <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and his wife Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>,
and a photographer proceeded in a car to the office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> at the Bank of <span class="SpellE">P.I</span>. Building, Manila in the morning of that day; that on
the way, Isabel Gabriel obtained a medical certificate from one Dr. <span class="SpellE">Chikiamko</span> which she gave to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>
upon arriving at the latter's office and told the lawyer that she wanted her
will to be made; that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> asked Isabel
Gabriel to dictate what she wanted to be written in the will and the attorney
wrote down the dictation of Isabel Gabriel in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>,
a language known to and spoken by her; that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>
read back to her what he wrote as dictated and she affirmed their correctness;
the lawyer then typed the will and after finishing the document, he read it to
her and she told him that it was alright; that thereafter, Isabel Gabriel
signed her name at the end of the will in the presence of the three witnesses <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and also at the left-hand margin of each and every
page of the document in the presence also of the said three witnesses; that
thereafter <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>
attested the will by signing her name at the end of the attestation clause and
at the left-hand margin of pages 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the document in the presence
of Isabel Gabriel and the other two witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>; then, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> signed also the
will at the bottom of the attestation clause and at the left-hand margin of the
other pages of the document in the presence of Isabel Gabriel, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>; that Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>
followed suit, signing her name at the foot of the attestation clause and at
the left-hand margin of every page in the presence of Isabel Gabriel, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>; that thereafter,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> notarized the will as Notary Public,
entering the will as Doc. No. 458, Page No. 94, Book No. IV, Series of 1961, in
his <span class="SpellE">Notarial</span> Register.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the occasion of the execution and
attestation of the will, a photographer took pictures, one Exhibit
"G", depicting <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>,
the testatrix Isabel Gabriel, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span>, Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>, taken on said occasion of the signing of the will,
and another, Exhibit "H", showing <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> signing the will on a table with Isabel Gabriel, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> sitting around the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span>,
after finishing the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> act, then delivered the
original to Isabel Gabriel and retained the other copies for his file and <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> register.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
few days following the signing of the will, Isabel Gabriel, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gimpaya</span> and another photographer arrived at the
office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paraiso</span> and told the lawyer that she
wanted another picture taken because the first picture did not turn out
good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer told her that this
cannot be done because the will was already signed but Isabel Gabriel insisted
that a picture be taken, so a simulated signing was performed during which
incident <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> was
not present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's exacerbation centers on the supposed incredibility of
the testimonies of the witnesses for the proponent of the will, their alleged
evasions, inconsistencies and contradictions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But in the case at bar, the three instrumental witnesses who constitute
the best evidence of the will-making have testified in favor of the probate of
the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So has the lawyer who prepared
it, one learned in the law and long in the practice thereof, <span class="GramE">who</span>
thereafter notarized it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of them are
disinterested witnesses who stand to receive no benefit from the
testament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The signatures of the
witnesses and the testatrix have been identified on the will and there is no
claim whatsoever and by anyone, much less the petitioner, that they were not
genuine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the last and final analysis,
the herein conflict is factual and We go back to the rule that the Supreme
