				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition of Gregorio Solis for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision and orders rendered by respondent Court of Appeals, in its Cases
CA-G.R. Nos. 14811-R to 14817-R entitled, "People of the Philippines vs.
Gregorio Solis, et al.," affirming his conviction by former judge Jose N. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Gregorio Solis and several other <span class="GramE">co-accused</span>
were in­dicted, tried and found guilty of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
of public funds in Criminal Cases Nos. 2510-2516 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment was penned and signed on <st1:date year="1954" day="19" month="6">19 June 1954</st1:date> by the Honorable Jose N.
<span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>, then Judge-at-Large assigned to <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region></p>

<p class="BODY">All the accused were summoned to appear for promulgation of the
judgment on <st1:date year="1954" day="19" month="6">19 June 1954</st1:date>,
but no court proceeding was had on that day, as the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had declared it a special public holiday.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="20" month="6">20 June 1954</st1:date>,
Republic Act No. 1186, which abolished all existing positions of
Judges-at-Large, took effect without Executive approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="21" month="6">21 June 1954</st1:date>,
the defendants appeared before the court; this time, the court was presided
over by Honorable Perfecto R. <span class="SpellE">Palacio</span>, judge of
another <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Palacio</span>
promulgated the judgment of judge <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>, against
the objections of herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Solis appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals
and the cases were docketed therein as CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. Nos. 14811-R
to 14817-R.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said appellate
court, he <span class="GramE">raised</span> in issue and attacked the validity of
the promulgation of the judgment of the lower court, for having been made by
another judge after the incumbency of the judge who rendered it had ceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor-General's brief, in the Court of Appeals, agreed
that the promulgation was illegal and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, on <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="11">20
 November 1965</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals promul­gated its decision,
modifying petitioner's sentence in CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 14811-R,
acquitting him in CA-G.R. No. 14812-R and CA-G.</span> R. No. <span class="GramE">14813-R,</span> and affirming the lower court's decision in CA-G.
R. Nos. 14814-R to 14817-R; but petitioner's new counsel <span class="GramE">were</span>
not served a copy of the appellate court's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What they received was a noti­fication,
almost three (3) years <span class="GramE">later, that</span> is, on <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="8">25 August 1968</st1:date>, from the bondsman of
petitioner, informing them that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> had issued an order
for petitioner Solis to appear therein for <u>execution</u> of judgment in the
criminal cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="9">5
 September 1968</st1:date> that petitioner's counsel received a copy of the
Court of Appeals decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="8">29 August 1968</st1:date>,
petitioner filed an urgent motion with the Court of Appeals asking it to
restrain the lower court from executing the de­cision, to order the recall of
the records, and to cause the service of the decision of the Court of Appeals
on petitioner's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting thereon,
the Court of Appeals directed its Deputy Clerk of Court to send a telegram to
the lower court to suspend execution of sentence, required its Judgment Section
to immediately serve a copy of the de­cision, and to explain within ten (10)
days why no copy had been served on petitioner's counsel; but the Court of
Appeals did not order the recall of the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 September, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion
for the recall of the records but granted him a period of twenty (20) days to
file his motion for reconsideration of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, not­withstanding the absence of
the records in the Court of Appeals, pe­titioner submitted his motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was denied on <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="10">28 October 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, on 11 November 1968, appellant Solis interposed in this
Court the present petition for review, squarely presenting the issue of the
invalidity of the decision of the Court of First Instance and of the legality
of the actuations of the Court of Appeals in remanding the records even before
service of copy of its decision on petitioner's counsel and in arbitrarily
refusing to have the records recalled while the case was still pending before
it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present case of <i>certiorari</i> was considered submitted
for de­cision without respondents' brief,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as the Office of the Solicitor General manifested that "the only
consistent stand that the People can adopt is to agree with petitioner's
posture."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts heretofore stated, the judgment of trial judge
Jose N. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> was promulgated (on 21 June 1954)
one (1) day after his posi­tion as Judge-at-Large was abolished (on 20 June
1954) by Republic Act 1186.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment
is, therefore, void, for it is now firmly established in our jurisprudence that
a decision is void if promulgated after the judge who rendered it had
permanently ceased to be a judge of the court where he sat in judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a judgment is a nullity if it had been
promulgated after the judge had actually vacated the office and accepted
another office<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>;
or when the term of office of the judge has ended<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>;
or when he has left the Bench<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
or after the judge had vacated his post in view of the abolition of his
position as Judge-at-Large under Republic Act 1186;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>;
or after the cessation or termination of his incumbency as such judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6 of Rule 116 of the old Rules of
Court, allowing the dispensing with the presence of the judge in the reading of
a sentence, applies only to the physical absence of the judge, being construed
to mean that the decision of the judge may be promulgated even without his
presence, as long as he is still a judge of that court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> A
sentence has been set aside where the judge who presided in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> had
been extended an <u>ad interim</u> appointment to the Court of First Instance
of Manila, to which position he qualified before the judgment was filed with
the Clerk of the former court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Nullity likewise attached to a dismissal order when the temporary assignment of
the judge that rendered it had been terminated before the order was issued,
because a new judge for the same court qualified.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The main ground upon which the Court of Appeals held the
contested judgment of the Court of First Instance to be valid is that
"since the approval of Republic Act 1186, effective 20 June 1954, was not
yet publicly or generally known on 21 June 1954, judge <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>
should be considered as a judge <u>de facto</u> of said court and the
promulgation of his appealed decision on said date is valid and legally
effective".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This is a misapplication of the doctrine laid down in the very case cited by
the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> Luna vs. Rodriguez, supra, a judge <u>de facto</u> was
defined as one who has the reputation of being the officer he assumes to be and
yet is not a good officer in point of law because there exists some defect in
his appointment or his right to exercise judicial functions at the particular
time (37 Phil. on page 192); but it is "essential to the validity of the
acts of a <u>de facto</u> judge, that he is <u>actually acting</u> under some
color of right" (case cit. on page 190).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, Judge <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span> did not
actually act or perform or exercise the duties of judge when his decision was
promulgated, as he had ceased to be one, and the decision was promulgated under
another presiding judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other cases
cited by the Court of Appeals (<span class="SpellE">Regala</span> v. Judge of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, 77 Phil. 684; U.
S. v. <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>, 1 Phil. 73) were similarly misapplied, <i>as
</i>said decisions refer to the <u>acts</u> of a <u>de facto</u> judge, not to
a case where he did <u>not act.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that the Court of Appeals' decision can not stand,
there being no validly promulgated judgment of the trial court from which an
appeal could be taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion
renders it unnecessary to pass upon the alleged error of the Court of Appeals
in prematurely remanding the records to the court of origin and later refusing
to recall the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, the decision of the respondent
Court of Appeals and the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> are hereby voided
and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the
criminal cases are hereby ordered returned to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, for new
adjudication by the judge presiding therein, in ac­cordance with the evidence
already introduced, and for further proceeding conformable to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
