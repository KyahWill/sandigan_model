				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Roger Perete y Manlapas and Victorio Sajorda y Campus, for having killed a 
co-prisoner in the Bilibid Prisons at Muntinlupa, were charged with murder in 
the Court of First Instance of Rizal, in an information as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 25th day of March 1959, in the New Bilibid Prisons, 
municipality of Muntinlupa, province of Rizal, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and 
confederating together and mutually helping one another, armed with deadly 
weapons to wit: sharp-pointed instruments, with intent to kill and with 
treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously attack, assault and stab one Receval Langlangan, thereby 
inflicting upon, the latter stab wounds on the different parts of his body which 
caused his death instantaneously.</p>
<p>"The accused are quasi-recidivists having committed the abovementioned felony 
while serving their respective sentences after having been convicted of final 
judgment by competent courts."</p></blockquote>
<p>Arraigned on June 2, 1959, and assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>, Roger 
Perete pleaded guilty while the other accused, Sajorda, entered a plea of mot 
guilty. On the same day, the trial court rendered judgment as to appellant 
Perete, convicting him of the crime as charged, the dispositive part of which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, the Court finds the accused Roger Perete y Manlapas guilty of 
murder, penalized under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and it appearing 
that said accused is a quasi-recidivist, the Court, pursuant to Art. 160 of said 
Code, hereby sentences him to the death penalty, to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased in the amount of Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00) with no subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half of the 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The case is now before this Court on automatic review due to the penalty 
imposed. Atty. Jose Hernando, counsel <i>de oficio</i> for this appeal, assigns 
seven (7) errors, the salient burdens.of which are: (1) that the trial court 
should have examined the evidence and/or heard witnesses, after which appellant 
Perete should have been acquitted on reasonable doubt; (2) that there was no 
treachery or evident premeditation, so that the crime was only homicide, 
granting that appellant killed the victim; (3) that plea of guilt and voluntary 
surrender should have been considered mitigating to homicide; (4) that the trial 
court should have required evidence on the quasi-recidivism before appreciating 
it.</p>
<p>It is well-settled that a plea of guilt, when formally entered on 
arraignment, is sufficient to sustain a conviction even for a capital offense 
without the introduction of further evidence, and that such plea admits all the 
material allegations of the information, including the attendant circumstances 
qualifying and/or aggravating the crime (People <i>vs</i>. Yamson, et al., 109 
Phil., 795; People <i>vs</i>. Ala, 109 Phil., 390; People <i>vs</i>. Salazar, 
105 Phil., 1058; People <i>vs</i>. Santos, et al., 105 Phil., 40; People 
<i>vs</i>. Acosta, 98 Phil., 642; 52 Off. Gaz., 1930). While.it may be the 
better practice in serious cases, as the one at bar, to receive such additional 
evidence as would sustain the conviction independently of the plea of guilt, 
this depends on the sound discretion of the trial court, according1 to whether 
it was satisfied that the plea of guilt was made with knowledge of its import 
(People <i>vs</i>. Yamson, et al., <i>supra</i>; People <i>vs</i>. Acosta, 
<i>supra</i>.) The record does not show that the trial court committed any abuse 
of discretion in not requiring additional evidence. When appellant Perete was 
arraigned on June 2, 1959, he was assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>. The 
presumption is that said counsel regularly and faithfully discharged his 
official functions, which included the duty of advising the accused as to the 
meaning of his plea of guilt (People <i>vs</i>. Yamson, et al., <i>supra</i>. In 
any case, accused or his counsel were never heard to complain, at the 
arraignment, or in any time thereafter, in fact, not even after the death 
sentence was imposed, that the plea of guilt was improvidently given without 
understanding its significance. Indeed, the trial judge must have fully 
satisfied himself that appellant Perete entered his plea of guilt with full 
knowledge of the meaning and consequences of his act, for the information was 
read and a copy thereof delivered to said accused and his counsel before the 
plea was entered. According to the trial judge appellant entered his plea 
"spontaneously and voluntarily". Nothing in the record justifies us to conclude 
otherwise.</p>
<p>The record itself amply demonstrates that the plea of guilt was taken as a 
calculated risk, to invite the mercy of the trial court in the face of what 
portended to be overwhelming evidence for the prosecution. Both appellant Perete 
and his co-accused, Sajorda, in their respective affidavits executed on the very 
morning when prisoner Receval Lanlangan was found sprawled and dying in the 
toilet of Dormitory-A, confessed to the macabre details of their heinous crime 
(pp. 7-10, Record). According to their own version, they silently pounced on 
Langlangan and stabbed him many times with their sharp-pointed instruments 
inside the toilet of Dormitory-A. Their victim sustained no less than about 41 
stabs on different parts of the body (Autopsy Report, pp. 3-4, Record). A few 
minutes after, prison guard Deogracias Salvador and his companions, responding 
to a call to bring out two prisoners, came upon appellant Perete and accused 
Sajorda, holding sharp-pointed weapons, and who readily admitted having just 
killed a prisoner (p. 6, Record). Perete and Sajorda were immediately brought to 
the Officer of the Day, before whom they executed the affidavits already 
mentioned.</p>
<p>Even viewing the case in the most favorable light, the death penalty cannot 
be avoided. The crime committed is murder qualified by treachery, with the 
aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and quasi-recidivism (Art. 
160, Revised Penal Code), all alleged in the information which the accused 
admitted by his plea. Conceding <i>arguendo</i> that not only plea of guilt but 
voluntary surrender as well are present, these cannot alter the penalty of 
death, since even without evident premeditation, quasi-recividisim, as a special 
aggravating circumstance, raises the penalty to the maximum period of that 
prescribed by law for the new crime committed. And we find the allegations in 
the information pertaining to quasi-recidivisim sufficient, its essence being 
that a person shall commit a felony after having been convicted by final 
judgment for another crime before beginning the service of such sentence or 
while serving the same. We find it unnecessary to discuss the other points 
raised in counsel <i>de oficio's</i> brief, which are clearly without merit.</p>
<p>Finding no error in the decision under review, the same is hereby affirmed. 
With costs <i>de oficio</i>.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo,
