Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said

suffered damages in the sum of P8,000.00 in consonance with the provision of

<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dellomos</span>, his
neighbor, so he got his flashlight and his bolo and went down his house and hid
himself from the banana plantations <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of his
house near the barrio trail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 61, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Nov. 4, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Dolfo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While thus hiding, he heard noises of persons
passing the trail near him and when he saw persons running by that trail, which
was about five meters from where he was, he lighted his flashlight and focused
it on the persons running and recognized them to be accused Felipe <span class="SpellE">Dueño</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dueño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Andresito</span> <span class="SpellE">Belonio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(p. </span>64, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

</span>(p. 286, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Sept. 17, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Dueño</span>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial Court — after considering the prosecution evidence and
the <u>alibi</u> put up by the three accused — found as the motive for the com­mission
of the offense that the three accused were angry at <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dellomos</span> and Federico <span class="SpellE">Dolfo</span>
because the latter returned the stolen <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to its
owner in <span class="SpellE">Malagit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pontevedra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stolen <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
was left by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Dueño</span> in the care of his father-in­-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Demontaño</span>
was mistaken for <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dellomos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further found that the three accused
conspired in committing the offense, as shown "by the fact that in all
incidents of their criminal adventure they were always together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in their gayest moment while drinking
tuba in the house of their principal witness, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Herminda</span>
del Rosario, they were together." The defense of alibi was considered very
weak, since "(t)he distance of the alleged hideouts of the three accused
in the town of <span class="SpellE">Pontevedra</span> to the town of <span class="SpellE">Maayon</span>, the seat of the crime, is not very far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maayon</span>, was
formerly a barrio of the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pontevedra</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and a good road now running vast sugarcane plantations, connects the two towns
which are very accessible to each other by trucks, jeeps and automobiles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime took place at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One can be catching fish or doing carpentry
work in <span class="SpellE">Pontevedra</span> during daytime and commit murder
in <span class="SpellE">Maayon</span> in the evening." After weighing the
evidence, the trial Court found the three defendants — Felipe <span class="SpellE">Dueño</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dueño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Andresito</span> <span class="SpellE">Belonio</span> — "guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of murder with the qualifying circumstances of treach­ery and evident
premeditation, with the aggravating circumstance of nighttime to facilitate its
commission," and imposed "life imprisonment or <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> with all necessary penalties attached to
it; to pay jointly severally the heirs of Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Demontaño</span>

<p class="BODY">By way of resume then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

1963, the three accused-appellants fired upon <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dellomos</span> and Federico <span class="SpellE">Dolfo</span> but
missed them; and that in the evening of the same day, the three again were

<p class="BODY">In specific regard to the circumstances attendant in the
commission of the offense, Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code is clear that
only one qualifying circumstance is necessary to qualify the offense as murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the trial court found
that the two qualifying circumstances — treachery and evident premeditation —
attended the commission of the offense and utilized both conjointly to qualify
it to murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As treachery sufficiently qualifies the
killing to murder — evident premeditation having been also alleged in the
information and proved, should be considered as a generic aggravating
circumstance only.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
However, jurisprudence is settled that evident premeditation cannot be appreciated
in a case where, although the accused had planned the perpetration of the
killing, the victim was different from the person whom the accused had
originally intended to kill.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>

We said that "(e)<span class="SpellE">ven</span> when there is sufficient
proof of pre­meditation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
it cannot be considered as a qualifying circumstance x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>, because the person whom the accused intended to
kill was not Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Buralo</span>, who was hit by the
bullet, but her aunt Juana <span class="SpellE">Buralo</span>." In the case
at bar, it was <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dellomos</span>
whom accused-appellants intended to kill, but it was his nephew, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Demontaño</span>, instead, who was shot at and hit and
