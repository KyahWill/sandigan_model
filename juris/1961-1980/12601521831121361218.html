				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the decision, dated June 22, 1959, in Criminal Case No. 2235 of 
the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, finding both accused therein guilty 
of murder; and sentencing defendant Marianito Fetalvero to an indeterminate 
penalty of from 17 years and 4 months of <i>reclusión temporal</i> to 20 years 
of <i>reclusión temporal</i>, and the defendant Filadelfo Cachola, to 
<i>reclusión perpetua</i>, both with the accessory penalties provided by law; to 
indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of the deceased Ernesto Alquetra in 
the sum of P6,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and 
both to share equally the costs.
<p>The following facts have been established by the evidence: In barrio 
Capangpangan, Vigan, Ilocos Sur, on February 1, 1955, between 7:00 to 7:30 p.m. 
and after supper, the deceased Ernesto Alquetra and hia ten-year old nephew 
Enrique Alquetra went down their house to defecate at a vacant lot nearby, a 
place habitually used by some people in the neighborhood for that purpose. On 
their way, Ernesto and Enrique met Filomena Alquetra who was going to her 
grandmother's house to ask for some rice for her father. Ernesto and Enrique 
continued to walk, with the latter behind his uncle at about 1½ meters, when 
abruptly, Ernesto swerved north. Before Enrique could follow his uncle, he saw 
in the other direction, three meters away, appellant Fetalvero, who was wearing 
a hat and a black jacket. Taking two steps forward, Fetalvero drew a gun about 
10 inches long, aimed at Ernesto who was then about eight meters away, and fired 
successively. Even, as he tried to run away, already hit, Ernesto was met by 
appellant Cachola, Fetalvero's brother-in-law, who thereupon also fired at 
Ernesto. The guns used by appellants bore the same appearance.</p>
<p>Upon felling the hapless victim, Cachola scampered from the scene; Fetalvero 
had already run away after firing his successive shots at Ernesto. While 
fleeing, Cachola came upon Romeo Alquetra, who had gone down their house to 
follow his brother Ernesto, and also took a shot at Romeo but fortunately 
missed. Meanwhile, ten-year old Enrique, who had sought refuge behind a tree 
during the incident, run home to tall for help. He met his uncle Romeo along the 
way, to whom lie cried out that Fetalvero and Cachola had killed his uncle 
Ernesto. Romeo, Enrique, and others rushed to the spot, but Ernesto was, by 
then, a corpse.</p>
<p>Appellants Fetalvero and Cachola interposed self defense and <i>alibi</i>, 
respectively, to exculpate themselves from the charge. Fetalvero alleged that he 
was on his way to the Vigan <i>población</i> to see a movie that night; that as 
he was passing by Ernesto's house, he saw the latter by the roadside, as if 
waiting; that when Ernesto recognized him, the former said: "This is the end of 
you now," simultaneously drawing a gun and firing at appellant Fetalvero; that 
in self-defense, appellant also drew his 22-caliber automatic and shot Ernesto 
several times.</p>
<p>Fetalvero's claim of self-defense not only lacks basis, except his sole and 
uncorroborated testimony, but is also belied by the overwhelming evidence on 
record. That the deceased was the aggressor, who allegedly was first to draw and 
shoot, is negated by the absence of any gun of his. Nobody found it, not even 
the defense witness, patrolman Nicolas Torio, who allegedly was first to arrive 
on the scene. Again, the deceased Ernesto would not have brought along his 
ten-year old nephew, Enrique, had his plan been to ambush and kill appellant 
Fetalvero, or anyone else. We see no reason for further indulging in a 
discussion of this alleged self-defense, which is clearly a fabrication. Indeed, 
even Appellant Fetalvero must have been advised of the futility of maintaining 
such an untenable theory, for, on more than one occasion in the trial court, 
appellant Fetalvero offered to plead guilty to homicide, an offer, however, 
understandably rejected by the prosecution.</p>
<p>Equally unmeritorious is appellant Cachola's <i>alibi</i> that at the time of 
the incident, he was at home cooking. Except for this assertion coming from 
appellant Cachola himself, we find the <i>alibi</i> completely unsupported. 
True, appellant Fetalvero, Cachola's brother-in-law, asserted that he left the 
latter at home, and that Cachola did not participate in the killing. Fetalvero 
had nothing to lose in so testifying, while trying to cover up for his 
brother-in-law. Fetalvero could not admit that Cachola was with him in the 
killing of the deceased Ernesto without wrecking his (Fetalvero's) claim of 
self-defense. Consequently, Fetalvero's assertion that his brother-in-law was at 
home during the incident is bereft of any probative force. And at the risk of 
being trite, an <i>alibi</i>, we say again, can not prevail over positive 
identification by witnesses.</p>
<p>Enrique, Romeo and Filomena all clearly testified as to Cachola's identity 
and complicity in the crime. Enrique, only a ten-year old boy, relatively much 
less exposed to corruptive influences, unwaveringly pointed to Cachola as the 
one who, with Fetalvero, shot his untie in told biood. As early as the very 
night of the incident, February 1, 1955, in his affidavit, Exhibit "1" for the 
defense, ten-year old Enrique not only named Cachola as one of his uncle's 
assailants, but pointed to this man in a face-to-face confrontation. The time 
was too short from the incident to have enabled him to devise a false 
identification, especially considering the age of the boy. Another telling piece 
in the pile of evidence is that from the spot of the killing itself, defense 
witness patrolman Nicolas Torio admitted that almost immediately, he went to 
Cachola's house, because reports gathered on the scene pointed to appellants 
Fetalvero and Cachola as the killers. The fact confirms the spontaneous 
character of the identification, which, together with the rest of the evidence, 
leaves no room for reasonable doubt as to the guilt of both appellants. 
Particularly as to the <i>alibi</i>, it is pertinent to mention that the house 
in which both appellants Fetalvero and Cachola lived was only about 100 meters 
from the deceased Ernesto Alquetra's house and within the immediate vicinity of 
the killing, rendering it perfectly possible for appellant Cachola to have 
executed his purpose at the scene of the crime and be back in his house in no 
time at all.</p>
<p>The credibility of Enrique, Romeo and Filomena Alquetra is assailed as 
prejudiced because of their close relation to the deceased. The alleged 
affiliation of the Alquetra family to a rival political faction, and, 
particularly as to appellant Cachola, the killing in 1947 of one "Piano", 
allegedly related to the Alquetras, in which Cachola was also suspected, are 
ascribed as motives for their testifying falsely against appellants. Far too 
speculative and finding no support in the evidence, the above imputations can be 
given no decisive weight. It is not to be lightly supposed that the relatives of 
the deceased victim would callously violate their conscience to avenge the death 
of a dear one by blaming it on persons whom they know to be innocent 
thereof.</p>
<p>The trial court, which had the better opportunity to observe the demeanor and 
truthfulness of the witnesses, was satisfied that the witnesses for the State 
were reliable and it is entitled to great weight in assessing matters of 
credibility. The alleged inconsistencies or deficiencies in the statements of 
some prosecution witnesses, if at all, are insufficient to neutralize the heavy 
array of direct and circumstantial evidence pointing to the guilt of appellants. 
In fact, the alleged bad blood between appellant Fetalvero and deceased Ernesto 
Alquetra lends further credence to appellants' guilt, for both sides admit that 
even prior to the fatal incident, the deceased and Fetalvero had been mortal 
enemies, and had figured in a previous stabbing incident. Taken in connection 
with appellants' own assertion that they and the Alquetras belonged to rival 
political factions and did not see eye to eye with each other, the circumstances 
show conclusively that appellants had had more tnan sufficient motive to 
liquidate the deceased.</p>
<p>The crime is murder, qualified by treachery, and penalized under Article 248 
of the Revised Penal Code by <i>reclusión temporal maximum</i> to death. 
Nocturnity and superior strength are absorbed by treachery (People <i>vs</i>. 
Magsalin, 82 Phil., 271; others). Crediting appellant Fetalvero with, voluntary 
surrender as found by the lower court, the penalty imposable under the Code is 
in the minimum period, or <i>reclusión temporal maximum</i>. Applying the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law to appellant Fetalvero, the trial court correctly 
imposed on him the penalty of from 17 years and 4 months of <i>reclusión 
temporal medium</i> to 20 years of <i>reclusión temporal maximum</i>, that being 
a penalty the minimum of which is within the range of the penalty next lower in 
degree to that prescribed by the Code, while the maximum is within that which is 
properly imposable under the Code considering the mitigating circumstance of 
voluntary surrender. Since no modifying circumstance can be considered as 
regards appellant Cachola, the trial court again correctly imposed on him 
<i>reclusión perpetua</i>, as the medium period of that prescribed by law.</p>
<p>Finding no error in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed 
<i>in toto</i>. Costs against appellants.</p><i>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, 
Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
