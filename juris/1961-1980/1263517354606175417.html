Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>) in its Criminal Case No. 1618.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record before us is to the effect that Alexander <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sosing</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallego</span>
@ <span class="SpellE">Ruam</span> Fuentes, Jose De la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span>
@ Blackie, @ Jose Diaz, <span class="SpellE">Saling</span> <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>,
3 John Does and <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Ares were charged with the
crime of double murder, committed in the manner described as follows in the
Amended Information (Record, page 31)</p>

<blockquote>"That on 29 March 1960, at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening,
in <span class="SpellE">Manlabay</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dumingag</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named principal accused, armed with .45 caliber Pistol and .30
caliber Carbine Rifles, with intent to kill, treachery and evident pre­meditation;
conspiring and confederating one another, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and felonious­ly attack and shoot with said firearms Francisco <span class="SpellE">Calidquid</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Gomela</span>, husband and wife respectively in their house,
thereby in­flicting upon them mortal gunshot wounds on their bodies which
caused their instantaneous deaths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Ares is charged as an accomplice,
his 'criminal participation is being deduced from contemporaneous acts evi­dencing
actual participation in the criminal design'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW with the aggravating circumstances of (1)
having committed the crime in the dwelling of the deceased; (2) that the crime
was committed at night time to better accomplish their purpose; (3) that there
was superior arms and strength and (4) that accused Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> is a recidivist having been convicted for Homicide by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the case was set for arraignment, the prosecuting attorney
moved for the discharge of accused Alexander <span class="SpellE">Tilos</span>
for <span style="">lack of evidence, </span>and the
motion was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Ares,
assisted by counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> (the
others being still at large), appeared and the following developments took <span class="SpellE">place,according</span> to the decision itself:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>“. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Court apprised said
accused of the consequences of their plea, the seriousness of the charge and
the heavy penalty that may be imposed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said accused declared in open court that
they understood the full import of their plea and are ready and willing to
plead guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon
the Court ordered said accused to be arraigned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon being arraigned, the accused Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Ares,
assisted by their counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
each freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty as principal and accomplice
respectively." (Record, page 39)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon their plea and the circumstances disclosed by the <span style="">sworn state­</span>ments made by the accused
in their confessions to the authorities, and which were attached to the initial
complaint of the Chief of <span style="">Police
(Record, </span>pages 3 and 9),as well as the autopsy reports (Record, pages 15
&amp; 16) that <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Gumila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calidquid</span> died of severe-hemorrhage secondary to a
gunshot wound entering her right cheek, near the mouth, and <span style="">proceeding </span>downward, without exit of
the projectile, and that Francisco <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Calidquid</span></span><span style=""> in </span>turn
died from cerebral hemorrhage caused by a gunshot <span style="">wound in the right </span><span style="">temple near the right eyebrow, the court
below found the accused de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> guilty as
charged, with the four aggravating circumstances averred in the complaint and
the mitigating circumstance of spontaneous plea of guilty, and sentenced him to
death for the complex crime of double murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Ares was found likewise guilty of
double murder with the three aggravating circumstances, but, with the
mitigation due to voluntary sur­render and plea of guilty, was sentenced to <u>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> which said Ares did not appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused were further sentenced to pay jointly and severally
P6,000.00 to the heirs of each of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to law, the case <span style="">of
accused de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> was brought to this Supreme Court
on automatic review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After scrutinizing the record, counsel <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>
for accused de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> finds the decision of the
court below correct and in conformity with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our own study coincides with that appreciation, specially since it is a
well - established rule that a plea of guilty imports an admission of the
presence of the aggravating circumstances alleged in the information.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There being four aggravating circumstances and the lone mitigating one of plea
of guilty, the death penalty becomes mandatory.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It does appear, however,
that the trial court erred in considering the killing of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Calidquid</span> as one complex crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that both were
slaughtered by a single discharge of firearms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The husband being shot in the temple and the wife in the jaw, and the
finding of the corpses in different rooms of the house, clearly establish that
they were the victims of separate dis­charges, and that the accused committed
two separate and distinct murders, for which he should be separately penalized.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision under review must be, and
hereby is, modified in that the accused is sentenced to death for each murder
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> is further ordered to pay a civil indemnity of
P12,000.00 </span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (instead of P6,000.00, as adjudged below) to
the heirs of each of the victims, in addition to one-half of the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
