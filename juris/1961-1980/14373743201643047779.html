Tonsay,-Jose L. Espinos and the Bacolod Southern Lumber Yard sought to collect sums of money, the biggest amount of which was less than P2,000.00 and, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the municipal court.</p><p>This contention is devoid of merit because all the plaintiffs also asked for the nullity of the assignment of right with chattel mortgage entered into by and between Margarita G. Saldajeno and her former partners Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua. This cause of action is not capable of pecuniary estimation and falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance. Where the basic issue is something more than the right to recover a sum of money and where the money claim is purely incidental to or a consequence of the principal relief sought, the action is as a case where the subject of the litigation is not capable of pecuniary estimation and is cognizable exclusively of the Court of First Instance.</p><p>The jurisdiction of all courts in the Philippines, in so far as the authority thereof depends upon the nature of litigation, is defined in the amended Judiciary Act, pursuant to which courts of first instance shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over any case the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary estimation. An action for the annulment of a judgment and an order of a court of justice belongs to this category.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p>In determining whether an action is one the subject matter of which is not capable of pecuniary estimation, this Court has adopted the criterion of first ascertaining the nature of the principal action or remedy sought, If it is primarily for the recovery of a sum of money, the claim is considered capable of pecuniary estimation, and whether jurisdiction is in the municipal courts or in the courts of first instance would depend on the amount of the claim. However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, where the money claim is purely incidental to, or a consequence of, the principal relief sought, this Court has considered such actions as cases where the subject of the litigation may not be estimated in terms of money, and are cognizable exclusively by courts of first instance.</p><p>In Andres <em>Lapitan vs. SCAND1A, Inc., el al.,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> this Court held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Actions for specific performance of contracts have been expressly pronounced to be exclusively cognizable by courts of first instance: <em>De Jesus vs. Judge Garcia</em>, L-26816, February 28, 1967: <em>Manufacturers' Distributors, Inc. vs. Yu Siu Liong</em> L-21286, April 29, 1966. And no cogent reason appears, and none is here advanced by the parties, why an action for rescission (or resolution) should be differently treated, a 'rescission' being a counterpart, so to speak, of specific performance.' In both cases, the court would certainly have to undertake an investigation into facts that would justify one act of the other. No award for damages may be had in an action for rescission without first conducting an inquiry into matters which would justify the setting aside of a contract, in the same manner that courts of first instance would have to make findings of fact and law in actions not capable of pecuniary estimation expressly held to be so by this Court, arising from issues like those arised in <em>Arroz v. Alojado et al.,</em> L-22153, March 3 1, 1967 (the legality or illegality of the conveyance sought for and the determination of the validity of the money deposit made); <em>De Ursita v. Pelayo</em>, L-13285, April 18, 1950 (validity of a judgment); <em>Bimayog v. Tunas,</em> L-1 2707, December 23, 1959 (validity of a mortgage); <em>Baito v. Sarmiento</em>, L-13 105. August 25, 1960 (the relations of the parties, the right to support created by the relation, etc., in actions for support); <em>De Rivera, et at. v. Halili</em>, L-15159, September 30, 1963 (the validity or nullity of documents upon which claims are predicated). Issues of the same nature may be raised by a party against whom an action for rescission has been brought, or by the plaintiff himself. It is, therefore, difficult to see why a prayer for damages in an action for rescission should be taken as the basis for concluding such action as one capable of pecuniary estimation â a prayer which must be included in the main action if plaintiff is to be compensated for what he may have suffered as a result of the breach committed by defendant, and not later on precluded from recovering damages by the rule against splitting a cause of action and discouraging multiplicity of suits."</p></blockquote><p>The foregoing doctrine wag reiterated in <em>The Good Development Corporation vs. Tulaan,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> where this Court held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"On the issue of which court has jurisdiction, the case of <em>Seno vs. Pastolante, et al.,</em> is in point. It was ruled therein that although the purpose of an action is to recover an amount plus interest which comes within the original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court, yet when said action involves the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage covering personal properties valued at more than P2.000, (now P10,000.00) the action should be instituted before the Court of First Instance.</p><p>In the instant case, the action is to recover the amount of P1,520.00 plus interest and costs, and involves the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage of personal properties valued at P15,340.00.00, so that it is clearly within the competence of the respondent court to try and resolve."</p></blockquote><p>In the light of the foregoing recent rulings, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental did not err in exercising jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 5343.</p><p>The appellants also contend that the chattel mortgage may no longer be annulled because it had been judicially approved in Civil Case No. 4797 of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental and said chattel mortgage had been ordered foreclosed in Civil Case No. 5223 of the same court.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>On the question of whether a court may nullify a final judgment of another court of co-equal, concurrent and coordinate jurisdiction, this Court originally ruled that:&nbsp; </p><p>"A court has no power to interfere with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction having equal power to grant the relief sought by the injunction.&nbsp; </p><p>"The various branches of the Court of First Instance of Manila are in a sense coordinate courts and cannot be allowed to interfere with each others" judgments or decrees."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The foregoing doctrine was reiterated in a 1953 case12 where this Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The rule which prohibits a Judge from interfering with the actuations of the Judge of another branch of the same court is not infringed when the Judge who modifies or annuls the order issued by the other Judge acts in the same case and belongs to the same court (<em>Eleazar vs. Zandueta</em>, 48 Phil. 1993. But the rule is infringed when the Judge of a branch of the court issues a writ of preliminary injunction in a case to enjoin the sheriff from carrying out an order by execution issued in another case by the Judge of another branch of the same court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (<em>Cabigao and Izquierdo vs. Del Rosario et al.</em>, 44 Phil. 182).</p></blockquote><p>This ruling was maintained in 1964. In <em>Mas vs. Dumaraog</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo was the action for annulment was filed with the Court of First Instance of Antique, both courts belonging to the same Judicial District. This Court held that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The power to open, modify or vacate a judgment is not only possessed by, but is restricted to the court in which the judgment was rendered."</p></blockquote><p>The reason of this Court was:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>""Pursuant to the policy of judicial stability, the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be interfered with by any court of concurrent jurisdiction."</p></blockquote><p>Again, in 1967 this Court ruled that the jurisdiction to annul a judgment of a branch of the Court of First Instance belongs solely to the very same branch which rendered the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p>Two years later, the same doctrine was laid down in the Sterling Investment case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p>In December 1971, however, this court re-examined and reversed its earlier doctrine on the matter. In <em>Dupla vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this Tribunal, speaking through Mr. Justice Villamor declared:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>". . . the underlying philosophy expressed in the <em>Dumara-og</em> case, the policy of judicial stability, to the end that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be interfered with by any court of concurrent jurisdiction, this Court feels that this is as good an occasion as any to re-examine the doctrine laid down. . .</p><p>"In an action to annul the judgment of a court, the plaintiffs cause of action springs from the alleged nullity of the judgment based on one ground or another, particularly fraud, which fact affords the plaintiff a right to judicial interference in his behalf. In such a suit the cause of action is entirely different from that in the action which gave rise to the judgment sought to be annulled, for a direct attack against a final and executory judgment is not a incidental to. but is the main object of the proceeding. The cause of action in the two cases being distinct and separate from each other, there is no plausible reason why the venue of the action to annul the judgment should necessarily follow the venue of the previous action.</p><p>"The present doctrine which postulate that one court or one branch of a court may not annul the judgment of another court or branch, not only opens the door to a violation of Section 2 of Rule 4, (of the Rules of Court) but also limit the opportunity for the application of said rule. . .</p><p>"Our conclusion must therefore be that a court of first instance or a branch thereof has the authority and jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to act in. suit to annul final and executory judgment or order rendered by another court of first instance or by another branch of the same court . . ."</p></blockquote><p>In February 1974 this Court reiterated the ruling in the Duiap case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p>In the light of the latest ruling of the Supreme Court, there is no doubt that one branch of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental can take cognizance of an action to nullify a final judgment of the other two branches of the same court.</p><p>It is true that the dissolution of a partnership is caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> However, on dissolution, the partnership is not terminated but continuous until the winding up of the business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p>The remaining partners did not terminate the business of the partnership "Isabela Sawmill." Instead of winding up the business of the partnership, they continued the business still in the name of said partnership. It is expressly stipulated in the memorandum-agreement that the remaining partners had constituted themselves as the partnership entity, the "Isabela Sawmill."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p>There was no liquidation of the assets of the partnership. The remaining partners, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua, continued doing the business of the partnership in the name of "Isabela Sawmill." They used the properties of said partnership.</p><p>The properties mortgaged to Margarita G. Saldajeno by the remaining partners, Leon Garibay, and Timoteo Tubungbanua, belonged to the partnership "Isabela Sawmill." The appellant, Margarita G. Saldajeno, was correctly held liable by the trial court because she purchased at public auction the properties of the partnership which were mortgaged to her.</p><p>It does not appear that the withdrawal of Margarita G. Saldajeno from the partnership was published in the newspapers. The appellees and the public in general had a right to expect that whatever credit they extended to Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua doing the business in the name of the partnership "Isabela Sawmill" could be enforced against the properties of said partnership. The judicial foreclosure of the chattel mortgage executed in favor of Margarita G. Saldajeno did not relieve her from liability to the creditors of the partnership.</p><p>The appellant, Margarita G. Saldajeno, cannot complain. She is partly to blame for not insisting on the liquidation of the assets of the partnership. She even agreed to let Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua continue doing the business of the partnership "Isabela Sawmill" by entering into the memorandum-agreement with them.</p><p>Although it may be presumed that Margarita G. Saldajeno had acted in good faith, the appellees also acted in good faith in extending credit to the partnership. Where one of two innocent persons must suffer, that person who gave occasion for the damaged to be caused must bear the consequences. Had Margarita G. Saldajeno not entered into the memorandum-agreement allowing Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua to continue doing the business of the partnership, the appellees would not have been misled into thinking that they were still dealing with the partnership "Isabela Sawmill." Under the facts, it is of no moment that technically speaking the partnership "Isabela Sawmill" was dissolved by the withdrawal therefrom of Margarita G. Saldajeno. The partnership was not terminated and it continued doing business through the two remaining partners.</p><p>The contention of the appellants that the appellees cannot bring an action to annul the chattel mortgage of the properties of the partnership executed by Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua in favor of Margarita G. Saldajeno has no merit.</p><p>As a rule, a contract cannot be assailed by one who is not a party thereto. However, when a contract prejudices the rights of a third person, he may file an action to annul the contract.</p><p>This Court has held that a person, who is not a party obliged principally or subsidiarily under a contract, may exercise an action for nullity of the contract if he is prejudiced in his rights with respect to the one of the contracting parties, and can show detriment which would positively result to him from the contract in which he has no intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p>The plaintiffs-appellees were prejudiced in their rights by the execution of the chattel mortgage over the properties of the partnership "Isabela Sawmill" in favor of Margarita G. Saldajeno by the remaining partners. Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua. Hence, said appellees have a right to file the action to nullify the chattel mortgage in question.</p><p>The portion of the decision appealed from ordering the appellants to pay attorney's fees to the plaintiffs-appellees cannot be sustained. There is no showing that the appellants displayed a wanton disregard of the rights of the plaintiffs. Indeed, the appellant believed in good faith, albeit erroneously, that they are not liable to pay the claims.</p><p>The defendants-appellants have a right to be reimbursed whatever amounts they shall pay the appellees by their co-defendants Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua. In the memorandum-agreement, Leon Garibay and Timoteo Tubungbanua undertook to release Margarita G. Saldajeno from any obligation of "Isabela Sawmill" to third persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed with the elimination of the portion ordering appellants to pay attorney's fees and with the modification that the defendants.
