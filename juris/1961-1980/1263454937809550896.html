submitted on July 13, 1968, a pleading </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">entitled
"Compromise Agreement".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
signature of respondent </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">Primo <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> not appearing in the above Compromise Agreement, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">this Court, on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="7"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">July 22, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">, required the aforesaid respondent to comment
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came, on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">July 31, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">, a manifestation from </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">respondent Primo <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span>
expressing "his conformity and a signature </span>to the Compromise
Agreement in question, * * *."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">The Compromise Agreement is
worded as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A) That
defendant-appellant [in the proceedings below, petitioner here] will pay the
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> [in the proceedings below,
respondents Primo <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> and Carmen Bautista here]
the total sum of P12,000.00, P9, 000.00 of which being for the principal, while
P3, 000.00 shall be applied as attorney's fees; B) There will be no interest
due and the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> [in the proceedings
below, respondents Primo <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span> and Carmen Bautista
here] are hereby waiving the right to collect the same; C) There will be no
pronouncement as to cost; D) That plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
[in the proceedings below, respondents Primo <span class="SpellE">Zuñiga</span>
and Carmen Bautista here] hereby acknowledged the receipt of the total sum of
P12,000.00; under Check No. H0-10864 drawn against Philippine Commercial &amp;
Industrial</span> Bank for P9<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and Check No.
HO-10865 drawn against Philippine Com­mercial &amp; Industrial Bank for P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; and 3) That notwithstand­ing the decision of the
Court of Appeals in the above-entitled case, [CA-G. R. No. 37848-R] this
Compromise Agreement may be approved by this Honorable Court thereby setting
aside the decision of the Court of Appeals."</p>

<p class="BODY">While the above Compromise Agreement appears to be awkwardly
drafted, the parties as noted not even taking the trouble of designating <span style="letter-spacing: 0.95pt;">themselves correctly and in what capacities they
appear in this </span><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt;">petition for
certiorari, there is no legal objection to its approval, </span>which will have
the effect of setting aside the decision of the respondent Court of Appeals
sought to be reviewed, the rights of the parties being thereafter governed by
such aforesaid compromise as embodied in the judgment of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, let judgment be entered in accordance with the <span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">above Compromise Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the explicit terms thereof </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">nothing appears to be left further to be complied
with by the parties </span>to the same, there being no need therefore for the
usual reminder <span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">that strict compliance therewith
by those who entered into such Agree</span>ment should be enjoined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without pronouncement as to
costs.</span></p>
