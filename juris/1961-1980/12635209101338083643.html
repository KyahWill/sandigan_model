				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from an order of the Workmen's Compensation Commission and
its resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> denying the petition of herein peti­tioner,
for the consolidation of two cases filed in two different regional offices for
com­pensation for the death of one and the same person.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence of the death on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1967</st1:date> of Fer­nando Mendoza, an employee of
petitioner at its mining opera­tions in <span class="SpellE">Buug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, two separate
claims for death compensation were filed against petitioner in two differ­ent
regional offices of respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records, upon examination, show that one was first filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1967</st1:date> with Regional Office No.
IV, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, by <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Mendoza;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and the second was filed afterwards on <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1967</st1:date> with Regional Office No. IX, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
by <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de
Mendoza.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Each claimant claims to be the legal wife and surviving spouse of the deceased
and entitled to the compen­sation payable for his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">As both claimants insisted on their separate claims being heard
and tried by the respective regional offices where they were filed, and the
regional office referees were disposed to proceed separately, notwithstanding
their being aware of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the two cases,
petitioner filed with respondent com­mission its petition for consolidation of
the two cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged that since the
cases involved a common question of law and fact concerning the death of the
decedent, consolidation of the cases would avoid confusion and best serve the
interests of all parties concerned and therefore prayed for the consolidation
and joint hearing by one referee either in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
or <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> of the two cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent commission, through its chairman, issued its order
dated October 7, 1968, holding that consolidation would serve the best
interests of petitioner alone' in that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"such a con­cession in its behalf would prejudice one or the other
of the two claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the cases were
to be consolidated and heard in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the claimant who resided in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
would have to go all the way to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> with all her witnesses for
every hearing conducted therein until such time as the cases can be
terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if the
cases were to be heard in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the same inconvenience would result to the claimant who resided within the
jurisdiction of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> regional Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, while one or the other of the
claimants would be prejudiced in either case, the peti­tioner would be spared
from a similar inconvenience, and in fact, its best interest alone would be
served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such situation was never
contemplated in the pertinent Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
governing venue."</p>

<p class="BODY">It therefore denied consolidation ruling that "(U)<span class="SpellE">nder</span> Sec. 2, Rule 6 of the Rules of the Commission, the
claim shall be filed with the Workmen's Compensation Unit of the Regional
Office where the injury or illness was received or contracted or where the
claimant or any of the claimants reside or where the respondent or any of the
respondents reside or has his place of business, <u>at the option of the
claimant </u>(underscoring supplied).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Implicit in this provision is that the claimant, or claimants where
there are several of them, are given the right to select such venue of action
as are legally provided for their benefit."</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration of the denial order having been denied by the
resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1968</st1:date>
of the commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, petitioner filed this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition has merit and should be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The commission's Rules, particularly, Rule 6, section 2, provide
for the proper venue of claims and adequately cover the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Rule provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
Filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim shall be filed in
triplicate, with the Workmen's Com­pensation Unit of the Regional Office where
the injury or illness was received or contracted or where the claimant or any
of the claimants re­side or where the respondent or any of the res­pondents
reside or has his place business, at the option of the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The unit where the claim is first filed
shall assume exclusive jurisdiction over the case</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
(Underscor­ing ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as restated by the Court in <u>Philippine Cotton
Development Corp. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"a claim for compensation may be filed and heard in the region­al office
of any of the following places:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>where
the accident occurs; <u>where the claimant, or any of them, if more, resides</u>,
or <u>where the respondent or any of them, if more resides, at the option of
the claimant</u>." The Commission's rules contemplated that as in the case
at bar, there may be more than one claimant for the same compensable death
against the same employer and granted the choice of venue to the claimants as a
whole, but expressly provide that where there is a conflict as to choice of
venue among the claimants, the unit where the claim is <u>first</u> filed shall
assume exclusive jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is but in accord with the analogous rule on venue for the settle­ment
of the estate of deceased persons that" the court first taking cognizance
of the settlement of the estate of a decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to
the exclusion of all other courts."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To construe the rule, as respondent commission did, as allowing
several conflicting claimants to select as many venues of action as are legally
provided for the same compen­sable claim and against the same employer would
not be con­ducive to the orderly administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is only one subject matter and one
cause of action against petitioner-employer involved in the case at bar,
arising from the death of the decedent, even though there are two claimants
claiming the right to receive the same death compensation, each claim­ing to be
the legal widow and dependent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
cannot each claim the right to pursue their respective claims in separate and
independent proceedings, with unnecessary duplication of hearings and reception
of evidence on the common and iden­tical question of compensability of the
claim to the detriment of the public interest and of the parties themselves,
when they are in effect alternative claimants and the validity of their
conflicting claims to the same death compensation must be determined and
resolved in one proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
possibility of confusion that would result should the two referees arrive at
conflicting decisions on the merits of the identical question of fact and of
law presented with the compensability of the death being upheld in one case and
the claim for compensation being dismissed in the other case, should be
avoided.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal question of compensability of the death of the
deceased should therefore be heard and resolved in the first case filed in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
pursuant to Rule 6, section 2 of the commission's Rules, with the
claimant-widow in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span>,
considered an <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> therein, with a claim
adverse to that of the first claimant, <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to the commendable concern of the commission for <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span>, the claimant in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
City, who would in such case, according to the commission, have to come all the
way to Manila with all her witnesses for the hearings, it might be stated that <span class="SpellE">Emeteria's</span> attendance at the Manila hearings may well be
dispensed with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact of death on
April 5, 1967, of the decedent "when seized by sudden <span class="SpellE">hemi­phlegia</span>"
while in the employ of petitioner is after all not dis­puted and is of record
per the employer's reports to the commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is simply at issue is stated in the employer's <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
"that the deceased succumbed to a non-industrial illness" and the
attendance at the hearings of <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span> is not necessary
for the resolution of this medical question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whoever of the claimants is finally upheld has in her favor the law's
presumption of compensability of the death<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as the general rule of the commission governing proceedings therein
that "(T)he hearing, investigation and determination of any ques­tion or
controversy in workmen's compensation cases shall be without regard to
technicalities, legal forms and technical rules on evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Substantial evidence shall be sufficient to
support a decision, order or award."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What is really essential for <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span>
is to establish her claimed personal status as the legal wife and dependent
spouse of the deceased entitled to payment of the compensation, in the same
manner as it is equally essential for the first claimant in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>, to establish her claimed personal status as
such as against <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, here it would be principally a matter
of documentation and <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span> may submit the
documents in proof of her marriage to the referee in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
case, who would forward the same to the case in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to be considered with the documents submitted by <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any supplemental testimonial evidence that <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span> might wish to submit could likewise be taken by
the referee in the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City case by deposition
upon written interrogatories under Rule 24, sections 25 to 27 Will due notice
to Trinidad, who may submit cross-interrogatories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By analogy to the same Rule, Emeteria may
further submit written interrogatories ques­tioning <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>'s
claimed status to the referee in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
who may propound them to <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> at the hearings here,
and take all such evidence under consideration in resolving the conflict
between the two claimants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The procedure above suggested is in consonance with the commission's
own Rule 11, section 9 for consolidation and joint hearing of claims, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Joint Hearing
of Claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- The referee to whom cases
or claims involving a common question of law or fact arising from the same
occurrence or accident against a common employer, are assigned for hearing and
decision may order a joint hearing on said cases and ren­der only one decision
thereon when he believes that justice can best be served thereby."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">as well as with Rule 31, section 1 of the
Rules of Court, appli­cable in a <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span>
character,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which provides that the court ordering consolidation of actions or joint
hearing thereof "may make such orders concerning proceedings, therein as
may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay."</p>

<p class="BODY">The two cases shall therefore be consolidated with the case filed
in Manila, RO4-WC Case No. 7052, prevailing, sub­ject only to the right
reserved to <span class="SpellE">Emeteria</span> to submit in <span class="SpellE">Zam­boanga</span>
City, upon due notice to the other parties, to the ref­eree in the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City case her documentary evidence and
testimonial evidence upon deposition by written interrogatories, as well as any
interrogatories she may wish to have propounded to Trinidad, which shall be
forwarded to the Manila case to form part of the record thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only one decision shall be rendered in the
said <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> case, resolving the compensability of the
death of the deceased Fernando Mendoza as well as the question of who among the
two claimants is the legal wife and dependent of the de­cedent entitled to
receive any compensation payable under the Work­men's Compensation Act, for the
purposes of the Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission's determination as to who of the two claim­ants is
the legal wife of the decedent and as such a dependent en­titled under section
9 of the Act to the compensation<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
is a legal question that is subject to appeal in a proper case to this Court
for final determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing
referee is therefore en­joined to receive all evidence from the complainants as
to their respective claimed status as <u>dependent wife</u> of the decedent,
and to resolve the issue, subject to the commission's decision on review,
conformably to the provisions of substantive and adjective law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Republic vs. Workmen's Compensation
Commis­sion</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court overruled the commission's award of compensation to two alleged
illegitimate children of the deceased that to the widow, which was not disputed
by the employer) on the ground that their <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>,
on which was based the commission's award to them as dependent children, had
not been established in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the Civil
Code and that the baptismal certificates presented by the claimants did not
satisfy the Code's requirement of a record of birth or authentic writing for
purposes of meeting its provisions on voluntary recognition of the claimed <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that the commission may, in
accordance with section 8 of the Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
act as referee and arbitrator between the two claimants and help them reach a
mutually acceptable compromise settlement of allotting the com­pensation among
themselves and their dependent children, if any, in order to avoid unnecessary
expense, delay and litigation bet­ween them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be borne in mind that in cases where the second wife had in
good faith contracted marriage with the dece­dent notwithstanding the
subsistence of his marriage with the first wife, the Court has generally sought
and applied a just and equitable solution and division of the decedent's estate
among the two innocent surviving parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order and resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
appealed from are hereby reversed, and the two cases are ordered consolidated,
heard and decided by only the referee in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur, but I do not see the necessity for the decision in this
case going beyond holding that the separate claims herein involved should be
heard and decided by the referee in Regional Office No. IV, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
to the exclusion of the referee in Regional Office No. IX, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
City and that the Workmen's Compensation Commission has jurisdiction to
determine who between the two claimants is the legal widow of the deceased
worker entitled to be paid the compensation provided by law to a
"dependent widow".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all,
these are the only two issues that require determination by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the above issues of venue and
jurisdiction are settled, it is, in my considered view, a little officious on <span class="GramE">Our</span> part to suggest any procedure that the parties should
follow in the conduct of their respect­ive cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The danger in proposing guidelines which are
not fixed by any law or rule for the specific pur­pose herein involved, namely,
the settlement of claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and, therefore,
not binding upon anyone, lies in that the parties might conceivably adopt other
own devices they believe more conducive to their respective ends, in which
event, this Supreme Court would be placed in the unenviable position of being
ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, as far as simplifying
procedures is concerned, such deviation by either party might give rise to
unforeseeable complications and incidents, the resolution of which will further
delay the final disposition of the main case, and thus, the laudable objective,
evident in the main opinion, of hastening said disposition would be
defeated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, I, for one, am not
certain that the suggested procedure of written interrogatories is the most workable
and expeditious one, but I dare not make my own suggestion, since to do so
would be inconsistent with my view that the parties should be left free to do
what they believe is proper under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, in its obvious effort to assist the parties in finding
ways of settling their dispute most speedily and inexpensively, the main
opinion has strayed into mat­ters which I am afraid constitute pre-judgment
somehow of such issues as the compensability of the illness which caused the
death of the worker in question, the necessity of the personal presence during
the hearings in Manila of the claimant from <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
and what matters only she has to prove.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think it is unfair, at this stage, to make any pronouncements on these
issues which are yet to be re­solved when the parties prosecute their
respective claims in the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, I join the commendable desire of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> to save parties as much effort and ex­pense as
possible in prosecuting claims for compensation under the Workmen's
Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, every tech­nicality
should be swept aside in such cases in favor of the most speedy and inexpensive
procedure of arriving at a just and fair award to the proper parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In pursu­ance of this end, however, this
Court need not go out of its way so as to act as the guardian for all claimants
and improvise procedures not set out in any legislative enactment whether
general or special <span class="GramE">nor</span> in any rule of court
specifically designed for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
believe that our task in the premises is limited to matters with­in our
appellate jurisdiction, the promulgation of the rules of procedure in the
Workmen's Compensation Commission having been lodged squarely by the law in
that Com­mission itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="GramE">par</span>. <span class="GramE">(c), Sec. 47, Act No. 3428, as
amended.]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the two issues submitted for Our resolution, those
of venue and jurisdiction, I concur, as I have already indicated, in the
holding that pursuant to Sec. 2 of Rule 6 of the Commission, quoted in the main
opinion, the two claims herein involved should be heard and decided by the
referee in the Manila regional office where the first claim was filed, to the
exclusion of the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City regional office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear to me that the contingency of two
women filing in distinct places separate claims in which they allege adversely
to one another each to be the legal widow of the same work­er is within the
contemplation of the provision in the cited section of the rules to the effect
that where separate claims are filed in more than one of the venues fixed
therein, "the unit where the claim is first filed shall assume exclusive
jurisdiction over the case." It is a necessary consequence of this
provision that any hardship to any of the parties occasioned by their separate
claims and their respective initial venues is part of the very nature of the
reasons for which such sepa­rate claims are filed and, naturally, it is not
imposing any uncalled for burden upon them that they should be prepared to
undergo said hardships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I submit that,
after all, the law need not assume that workers would enter in­to extra-legal
relationships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the resolution
of the Commission upholding the propriety of the separate venues of the two
claims in question is obviously imprac­tical, since it overlooks the fact that
of necessity only one common decision can be rendered in regard to the two
claims and the Commission does not suggest how this can be done under the
procedure it has sanctioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely,
it is one of the purposes of the rule fixing a common venue to enable the
Commission to render such a single decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say, however, that the parties and their lawyers,
if any are contracted to assist them, and the government authorities concerned,
particularly those in the Workmen's Compensation Commission, should not, in
laying down the detailed procedure of hearing such separate claims, seek, in
cooperation with each other, the most practical, inexpensive and speedy ones in
each par­ticular case, having in mind the peculiar circumstances thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We trust the members of the bar and the offi­cers
of the Commission to be imbued with the humane and social intendment of the
law, reflected in all its provisions, particularly, that which limits the
attorney's fees that may be charged in such cases to not more than five (5) per
cent of the amount received by the claim­ants, if the case is not appealed and
ten (10) per cent in case it is appealed, (Sec. 31) and that true to the spirit
of the enactment, no unnecessary obstacle would be placed by any of them to the
prompt disposition and settlement of all claims, with the least expense.</p>

<p class="BODY">In line with this idea, I join Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehan­kee</span>
in suggesting to the parties herein utilization of or resort to the procedure
indicated in Section 8 of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this particular instance, since there is a law specifically providing that in
case of disagreement among several persons entitled to compensation as to their
respective shares, the Workmen's Compensation Commission shall act as referee,
it not unduly stretch­ing the law for Us to hold that by analogy, the Commis­sion
should also act as referee when there are two wo­men respectively claiming to
be the true and legal widow of a deceased worker, thereby obviating the
necessity of a protracted litigation to settle the issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings me to the matter of jurisdiction which I believe is
the more pressing issue in this case, if only because neither the law nor the
rules make any spe­cific reference thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question is, does the Workmen's Compensation Commission, have
jurisdiction to decide as to <span class="GramE">who</span> between two alleged
widows of a worker is the true and legal one?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or is that point a civil law matter which comes within the competence of
the ordinary courts, so as to necessitate the filing of a separate court proceeding
thereon before the Commission may final­ly decide to whom to make the
award?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, I feel that the
importance of this question deserves more than the seemingly passing and casual
attention given to it almost matter-of-factly in the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I venture to say that apparently,
the main opinion assumes that the jurisdiction in question belongs to the
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">While I agree that this assumption is ultimately correct, I
prefer to spell out its bases considering that, to my knowledge, this is the
first case brought to this Court, in which this issue is decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, if <span class="GramE">We</span> do
not decide this squarely now, any of the parties might prolong this
compensation case by raising the issue later.</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be recalled, before the passage of Republic Act 772 on <st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1952</st1:date>, compensation cases
were filed, tried and decided in the regular courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was by this Act that Section 46 of Act
3428 was added providing thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 46.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Jurisdiction.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Workmen's Compensation Commissioner
shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide claims for compensation
under the Workmen's Compensation Act, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court,
in the same manner and in the same period as provided by law and by rules of
court for appeal from the court of Industrial Relations to the Supreme
Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Blue Bar Coconut Company vs. Boo, 95 Phil. 867, made it clear
that the "exclusive jurisdiction" vested by Republic Act 772 upon the
Workmen's Compensation Commission to hear and decide claims for compensation
under the Act is intended "to withdraw or take away that jurisdiction from
the Justice of the Peace Courts and Courts of First Instance that theretofore
heard and decided workmen's claims for compensation within their respective
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Congress has the power and authority to
vest in the Workmen's Compensation Commission the jurisdiction to hear and
decide claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act to the exclusion of the
Courts that theretofore had exercised such jurisdiction" (p. 870).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having in view the intent of the Act to
simplify and expedite the settlement of claims contemplated in it, it stands to
reason that this transfer of juris­diction must be construed to be plenary and
complete.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are, however, two schools of thought as to the extent of
this jurisdiction in regard to the determination of the persons entitled to be
considered as "dependents" for the purposes of the Act under its
Section 9, when there are two or more persons claiming the same status as
against each other, as, for example, the two alleged widows in the case at bar,
each of whom would like to be recognized as the true and legal dependent widow
to the exclusion of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
school be­lieves that the conferment of jurisdiction upon the Commission by
Section 46, as already stated, does not clothe it with authority to decide
questions of legal <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> because this pertains to
the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, hence, in such a situation, the pro­cedure
is to require the contending parties to have the matter settled first in court,
preferably in the settlement of the estate of the deceased or in an <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span>, and the determination of the question of
"dependency" may be made by the Commission only after the court has
decided the matter of <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other school of course, of the view that
the transfer of jurisdiction from the courts to the Commission is, as I have
already stated, plenary and complete, for the purposes, at least, of the
payment of claims under the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
true, according to this school, that the same issue of <span class="SpellE">filia­tion</span>
may conceivably arise in court in relation to other matters between the same
parties, such as in the settlement of the estate of the deceased worker, should
he leave any <span class="SpellE">partitionable</span> one in which other
persons, who have not and could not have appeared before the Commission for
lack of legal interest in the subject matter, may be entitled to take part, and
the possibility of a diverse finding in the two proceedings does exist, but
such a contingency must be accepted as part of the vary nature of the two
remedies which are distinct and different from each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be seen, the first view has the juridical advantage of
singleness of determination of the matter of <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
from the point of view of family solida­rity, while the other suffers from the
defect that this important point may be decided differently by the Com­mission
and the court, thus resulting in the absurdity that the <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
found to be legitimate by the former may be found to be illegitimate by the
other, but, as already stated, those who uphold the second view contend that,
for the sake of hastening the award of compensation to the parties who, in any
event, would factually be in need thereof, the risk of such diversity of
findings may well be worth taking, the chances thereof being, anyway,
ordinarily remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very worse, it
is pointed out that <span class="SpellE">juridically</span> speaking, there is
nothing wrong with such a possibility, for there are other instances in law
where such a contingency is permitted, such as, (1) in the case of recovery of
damages <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">contractu</span></u> or from <u>culpa</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>aquiliana</u></span> independently of the acquittal of the re­sponsible
party in a criminal case involving the same ba­sic facts and (2) in cases of
registration of voters wherein a person may be held by the court to be a
Filipino citizen and a resident of a particular place for registration purposes
for a particular election and yet may be found to be an alien or a non-resident
in an ordinary court proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasons
for the possibility of diverse findings are many and varied, among them, the
difference in the quantum or in the nature of the evi­dence or proof required
which varies in each proceeding, but whatever be the cause or causes, the
variance in the results of the different proceedings has always been con­sidered
as <span class="SpellE">juridically</span> tolerable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon these considerations, it is not difficult to choose which
school to follow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite obvious
that the noble objectives of the Workmen's Compensation Act may best be
achieved by placing within the jurisdiction of the Commission all matters
relevant to the proper payment of any claim contemplated in the Act, without
pre­judice to whatever the courts may hold in respect to said matters in any
other proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">For these reasons, I vote to reverse the appealed order and resolution
<u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of the Workmen's Compensation Commission and to order the
said Commission to have the venue of the two claims in question laid in the
regional office in Manila, leaving it to the Commission and the parties to
devise together the most expedient and inexpensive means of hearing and
disposing of the same, including the question of who between the two claimants
is the real dependent widow of the deceased laborer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in the ably written opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, which I join, is the recognition of the power of
the Workmen's Compensation Commission, an administrative tribunal, to pass upon
and decide questions ordinarily falling within the competence of and cognizable
by the judiciary, namely "as to who of the two claimants is the legal wife
of the decedent and as such a dependent entitled under Section 9 of the act to
the compensation * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus once again is made evident a sympathetic response to the question of the
permissible scope of the authority that may be lawfully entrusted to
administrative agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is as it
should be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No bar should be interposed
to the conferment of the needed authority to the governmental agency which can
best discharge the function entrusted to it, even at the risk of defying the
canons a rigid, formalistic approach to the postulate of separation of powers
would impose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not admit of doubt
that if the determination as to who is the widow of the deceased according to
law in case conflicting claims are raised cannot be passed upon by the
Commission but must be left to the courts in a separate action, then the result
would be further delay and frustration of an objective of a legislation which
in accordance with the social justice principle and protection to labor
provisions of the Constitution require speedy implementation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latest manifestation of according wide
discretion to administrative <span class="GramE">tribunals</span> marks to my
mind the attainment of further progress in the effort of government through
such instrumentalities to cope with the increased responsibilities thrust on it
if social and economic rights, or liberty in an affirmative sense, would be
vitalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this brief concurring
opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to Republic Act No. 772<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the office of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner which was later amended
by Republic Act No. 4119 establishing in its place a Workmen's Compensation
Commission composed of a Chairman and two Associate Commissioners,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the enforcement of the Workmen's Compensation Act was left to the courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The judiciary then had the task among others of passing on all questions as to
whether or not there is a right to compensation, the amount due and to
whom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A dispute as to who of the
claimants was the legitimate widow of the deceased entitled as a dependent to
compensation clearly then was for the appropriate court to settle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In line with the growing tendency to entrust
the enforcement especially of legislation social in character to administrative
bodies on the assumption that there would be a more speedy disposition of
matters submitted to them as there is less reliance on strict procedural rules,
the aforesaid statutes were passed by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a clear manifestation of the legislative objective then to
leave to the Workmen's Compensation Commission its implementation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be admitted that no specific
reference is made as to whether or not it could, in the discharge of the
responsibility entrusted to it, resolve issues which in their traditional
terminology of the law is "judicial in character." It could be that
for those enamored of the conceptual approach, there should be <span class="GramE">a</span> demarcation of functions so that on the judiciary, and on
it alone, should be left its determination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To so view the matter, however, is to run the risk, in this particular
case at least, of incurring additional delay in the disposition of claims, a
delay which could be ill-afforded by the heirs and dependents of those injured
from any accident arising out of and in the course of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a frustration of legislative purpose
should be avoided unless the language of the law leaves no other
alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have decided and, to
my mind, correctly.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is moreover the equally applicable doctrine of statutory
construction that whenever power is granted, it is to be assumed that the means
necessary so that its exercise would be rendered effective is to be deemed
included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly if it were not so, the
result might be to reduce the statute to a barren form of words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect would be nullification instead of
implementation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase Justice
Laurel, whenever there is a transfer of competence from one agency to another,
what could be lawfully performed by the former is not beyond the authority
conferred on the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There is to be no fragmentation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it
were otherwise, there is the risk of failing to achieve that which is desired.</p>

<p class="BODY">In terms of the fundamental principle of separation of powers,
this decision is a further recognition of the traditional flexibility
associated with such a concept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not to be enforced with pedantic rigor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The demands of practical statesmanship preclude a doctrinaire
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisive question
should be whether there is a need for an administrative tribunal being created
and if so, what powers must be entrusted to it to assure that the legislative
objective is attained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
under a tripartite system of government such agencies fall within the executive
branch should not be a bar to the conferment of such authority, even if
essentially judicial in character, as long as it is incidental to the discharge
of the task of its implementation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Any other view would be self-defeating.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is to be then no hesitancy in according the seal of approval to an
assumption of wider competence by administrative tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of course preferable that there be
express statutory language to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lacking such explicitness, an enactment is to be so construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would conduce to their further
efficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a further
recognition of what is now undeniable, that such agencies are, along with
courts, and perhaps to a greater degree, necessary instruments in the
fulfillment of the welfare function incumbent on government.</p>
