				<H3>MACARIA TINIO DE DOMINGO, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, SECOND DIST., CABANATUAN CITY, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The herein respondents-appellees are tenants of the herein petitioner in the 
latter's hacienda at Triala, Guimba, Nueva Ecija, under written contracts of 
tenancy executed with appellant-landowner. This case was commenced in the Court 
of Agrarian Relations upon complaint of the respondents-tenants against the 
petitioner-landholder to compel, among other things, the liquidation of the 
palay harvest for the agricultural year 1955-1956 under the sharing basis of 
55-45 in favor of respondents in accordance with their contracts (Exhibits 1 to 
79). The herein petitioner, in her answer to the complaint, alleges that while 
the contracts of tenancy provide for a 55-45 sharing basis in favor of the 
herein respondents, the sharing ratio should be 60-40 in petitioner's favor 
because she had shouldered the expenses of final harrowing and transplanting. 
During the trial of the case, the Court of Agrarian Relations issued several 
orders disposing certain incidental matters involved, such as the question of 
holding the harvested crops produced for the agricultural year 1955-56, the 
place where the liquidation should be done, the place where the bundles of palay 
should be stacked, and other similar matters. The Court of Agrarian Relations 
also allowed the herein respondents to present evidence showing fraud in the 
execution of the tenancy contracts, although said fact was not alleged by them 
in their complaint.
<p>After trial on the issues involved, the. Court of Agrarian Relations (by 
Judge Leon Dacayo) rendered decision declaring all the tenancy contracts null 
and void, as well as all the stipulations made therein, and ordering that the 
palay harvested for the agricultural year 1955-56 be liquidated on a 70-30 basis 
in favor of the herein respondents. Consequently, this petition for the review 
of the Court of Agrarian Relations' decision was filed by herein petitioner.</p>
<p>The question involved in this appeal is whether or not the Court of Agrarian 
Relations erred in nullifying the tenancy contracts in question and, 
consequently, in, disregarding the stipulations made therein, principally, the 
sharing basis of the net produce at 55-45 in favor of the 
respondents-tenants.</p>
<p>During the pendency of this appeal, on June 2&amp;, 1957, petitioner filed 
with respondent Court of Agrarian Relations various complaints in consignation 
against 75 of her tenants (CAR Cases Nos. 553 to 627 Nueva Ecija '57), most of 
said tenants being the herein respondents-tenants (15 respondents were not made 
parties in said cases). In her complaints, petitioner tendered her 1/2 shares in 
the costs of transplanting and final harrowing for the agricultural year 1956-58 
alleging that the respondents therein had refused to receive the same in 
violation of their tenancy contracts. The parties in these cases, on August 27, 
1957, entered into a Stipulation Of Facts wherein they agreed that the 
respondents therein are tenants of petitioner having tenancy contracts for a 
period of ten years, the validity of which are pending litigation in the Supreme 
Court; that respondents' refusal to accept petitioner's tender of her share in 
the expenses of final harrowingand transplanting was because under Act No. 4054 
and Republic Act No. 1199, they claim to have the right to change the sharing 
basis every agricultural year despite the fact that the period of ten years has 
not yet elapsed. The Court of Agrarian Relations (Tomas Panganiban, Judge) 
rendered a decision ordering the respondents therein to accept the tender of 
petitioner's share and to maintain the sharing basis of 55-45 in favor of 
respondents as agreed upon in their contracts. The respondents appealed the 
decision to the Supreme Court, but it was dismissed for lack of merit (G. R. No. 
L-13176, Sept. 18, 1957). Upon the finality of the judgment in these cases, 
several respondents therein withdrew from the respondent court their 
corresponding shares in the amounts consigned by the petitioner.</p>
<p>Similar complaints in consignation were filed by petitioner in 1958 and 1959 
for her share in the costs of final harrowing and transplanting for the 
agricultural years 1958-59 and 1959-60, decisions thereon having been held in 
abeyance by the respondent Court of Agrarian Relations (Judge Jose M. Santos, 
presiding), pending final determination by the Supreme Court of the appeal in 
the present case.</p>
<p>On October 5, 1958, 35 of herein respondents-tenants and the petitioner in 
the present case filed with the Supreme Court a motion for a judgment by 
compromise agreeing that the tenancy contracts were executed in accordance with 
law; that said contracts are all for a period of ten agricultural years from the 
date of their execution; that the sharing basis of 55-45 in favor of the 
respondents be maintained, except that for the agricultural year 1955-56, the 
sharing basis to be followed shall be that in accordance with the provision of 
Sections 32 of Republic Act 1199, 4»king into account the fact that the 
petitioner had shouldered all the expenses of final harrowing and transplanting 
for that year.</p>
<p>On November 28, 1959, two similar agreements were entered into between 
petitioner and several other respondents, bringing the total number of 
respondents who have compromised with the petitioner to 45, leaving only 30 
respondents who have not entered into any agreement with the petitioner, to 
wit:</p>

<p>As for these respondents who have not entered into any agreement with the 
petitioner, the following questions remain:</p>
<p>(1) Are the tenancy contracts valid or not?</p>
<p>(2) What shall be the sharing basis for the agricultural year 1955-56 taking 
into account the actual contributions of the parties in the cost of final 
harrowing and transplanting for that year? In other words, who shouldered the 
expenses of final harrowing and transplanting for the agricultural year 
1955-56?</p>
<p>The main thesis of appellant is that the decision of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations is not supported by substantial evidence. The trial court concluded 
that the contracts were fraudulently executed and, therefore, were null and 
void, taking into account the following circumstances and evidence:</p>
<p>(1) The contracts were printed in Tagalog, a dialect different from that of 
the tenants who only know Ilocano, to the extent that the Municipal Treasurer 
had the oontracts translated to the tenants by his clerk, which means that the 
contract is not in a language or dialect known to both parties thereto, contrary 
to section 12 of Republic Act 1199 and section 4 of Act 4054;</p>
<p>(2) That some contracts (Exhibits 1-4) were ratified by a Notary Public and 
not by the Municipal Treasurer or Mayor or Justice of the Peace, as required by 
section 12 of Republic Act 1199, and were so ratified four months after they 
were signed on May 20, 1955;</p>
<p>(3) That the contracts exhibits "5" to "79" were signed in May, June, and 
July of 1954, but sworn to before the Municipal Treasurer on July, August, 
September, and October of 1954, and registered without the presence of the 
tenants;</p>
<p>(4) That the tenants' copies were not delivered to them but to the landlord's 
overseer, who did not deliver the respective copies to the tenants (Dec, p. 
32);</p>
<p>(5) That the contract period was ambiguously worded "Isang Pung Taon", or 
"Isampung taon";</p>
<p>(6) The tenants, through their witnesses, De los Santos, Patricio, Galang and 
Santiago, showed that when the contracts were signed, they were given to 
understand that they were only for one (1) year and not for ten years, and that 
the contracts, were not signed or thumbprinted in the presence of the Municipal 
Treasurer or the Notary Public, nor were the contracts read to them.</p>
<p>It is apparent from the foregoing that the Court's finding that the contracts 
were contrary to law and fraudulent of not really assented to by the tenants, 
wherefore they should be annulled and set aside, is not a conclusion based on 
mere conjecture; it is supported by substantial evidence, derived from the 
testimony for the tenants, surrounding circumstances, and the provisions of the 
Tenancy Act. Whether or not the circumstantial evidence of fraud is or is not 
sufficient to overcome the testimony and evidence for the landowner is not a 
question for this court to decide; so long as the findings of fact of the 
Agrarian court attain the minimum evidentiary support demanded by the law, such 
findings can not be revised or altered by the appellate tribunals.</p>
<p>Proceeding now to examine the issues of law raised by the 
appellant-landholder, we find that there is no estoppel on the tenants to assail 
the binding effect of their written contracts simply because they asserted in 
their original petition that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Contracts covering their tenancy relationship have been duly executed by 
both parties for the agricultural year 1955-1956",</p></blockquote>
<p>since the contracts relied upon by the appellant landlord are ten-year 
contracts from 1955 to 1965, while the alleged judicial admission refers to 
one-year contracts.</p>
<p>We find no merit either in the appellant's contention that the tenants are 
precluded from contesting the written contracts because they failed to do so 
within 30 days from their registration, as provided by section 11 of Republic 
Act No. 1199:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 11. <i>Freedom to Contract in General</i>.—The landholder and the 
tenant shaft be free to enter into any or all kinds of tenancy contract, as long 
as they are not contrary to law, morals or public policy. Except in case of 
fraud, error, force, intimidation or undue influence, when such contract is 
reduced to writing and registered as hereinafter provided, the latter shall be 
conclusive evidence of what has been agreed upon between the contracting 
parties, if not denounced or impugned within thirty day after its 
registration."</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason is that, as pointed out for the respondent Court of Agrarian 
Relations, the section above-quoted does not apply to contracts tainted by fraud 
or other vice of consent, much less to contracts violative of the law itself, as 
the present ones were found to be. A second reason is that the tenants not 
having been furnished copies of the contract, and most if not all of them being 
illiterate, they can not be expected to contest a contract the exact terms of 
which were hidden from them.</p>
<p>It is true that the original complaint did not allege fraud, but the tenants, 
in the course of the trial, submitted "verbal motions seeking to amend the 
petition so as to include the allegation that respondent fraudulently secured 
the execution of the tenancy contracts invoked in this case, and praying that 
the said contracts be declared null and void and not binding on the parties." 
(Dec., p. 23; Petition for Review, p. 7). Over the defendants' objection, "the 
Court proceeded with the trial because it believed there was no necessity to 
make formal amendments to consider the issue raised in the verbal motion". (Dec, 
p. 24), "and allowed the parties to produce evidence on the circumstances 
surrounding the execution of the contracts of tenancy" (Dec, pp. 24-25).</p>
<p>This course is authorized by section 11 of Republic Act No. 1267 creating the 
Court of Agrarian Relations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 11. <i>Character of Order or Decision</i>.—In issuing an order or 
decision, the Court shall not be restricted to the specific relief claimed or 
demands made by the parties to the dispute, but may include in the order or 
decision any matter or determination which may be deemed necessary and expedient 
for the purpose of settling the dispute or of preventing further disputes, 
provided that said matter for determination has been established by competent 
evidence during the hearing."</p></blockquote>
<p>At any rate, even disregarding fraud, the written contracts were violative of 
the provisions of the Tenancy Act (R.A. 1199) in several respects previously 
pointed out. Wherefore, the Agrarian Court committed no reversible error in 
invaldating them and in applying the tenancy law as if no written contracts 
existed.</p>
<p>With regard to the contracts acknowledged before a Notary Public, section 12 
of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. No. 1199) expressly requires that (sec. 
12, par. 2)—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The contracting parties <i>shall acknowledge</i> the execution of the 
contract before the <i>municipal treasurer</i> or <i>justice of the peace</i> or 
<i>mayor</i> of the municipality where the land is situated." (Italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>Comparison with the corresponding provision of the preceding Rice Tenancy Act 
that it superseded (Act No. 4054), reciting—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oath or affirmation by the contracting parties before the <i>municipal 
treasurer</i> concerned <i>shall be sufficient</i> for the purpose of 
acknowledgment.,"</p></blockquote>
<p>leaves no room for doubt that the enumeration of the authorized acknowledging 
officers in section 12 of the prevailing statute, is a deliberate legislative 
reform, designed to exclude the intervention of Notaries Public in tenancy 
contracts, that should be made fully effective (cf. Butte vs. Uy &amp; Sons, 
Inc., <i>supra</i>, p. 437). No error was committed by, the trial court, 
therefore, in considering such notarial acknowledgments as violative of the 
law.</p>
<p>The Agrarian court pronounced that the tenants were entitled to 70% of the 
gross produce, having borne the cost of final harrowing and transplanting, as 
well as having furnished the labor, farm implements and work animals; and that 
the cost of the final harrowing and transplanting can not be regarded as equally 
shared between tenant and landlord when the latter pays his or her share after 
the said agricultural operations have already been completed. No reversible 
error was incurred in so holding, since under section 34 of Republic Act 1199, 
reimbursements for either party's contribution are not allowed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 34. <i>Reimbursement Not Allowed</i>.—Contributions or shares in the 
contribution to the production of the crop in the form of cash, grain or 
services, once shouldered or rendered alone by one party may not be reimbursed 
by the other party after the phase or phases of work required in the joint 
undertaking shall have been completed."</p></blockquote>
<p>The acceptance by the tenants of the landlord's belated contribution, 
therefore, was correctly considered by them and by the Court as loans repayable 
upon liquidation of the crop.</p>
<p>With regard to the crops subsequent to that of 1955-1956, the rejection by 
the tenants of the landlord's contribution to the cost of final harrowing and 
transplanting, if tendered in due time, can not be justified by the tenants' 
right to change the crop sharing arrangement unless the tenant has served notice 
of his intention to change upon the landholder at the advance end of the 
preceding agricultural year (Sec. 14, R.A. 1199). The giving of timely notice is 
an issue of fact that the Agrarian court is the one competent to decide.</p>
<p>Finding no reversible error in the judgment appealed from, we hereby affirm 
the same with respect to the tenants who have not entered into a compromise of 
their action against the landlord. The records are ordered remanded to the court 
of origin for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. Costs against 
appellant Tinio.</p>

Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.</i>, concur.</p></div>
