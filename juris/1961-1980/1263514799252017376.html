to arrive, he and his family had themselves inoculated against "El <span class="SpellE">Tor</span>"; that the following morning, December 8, 1961, he
and his family took the bus for the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Dancalan</span>,
and it was only when he arrived thereat that he learned of the death of Gerardo
<span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>, Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>

for his step-father; that on December 11, he slept in the house of his
mother-in-law in <span class="SpellE">Agrupacion</span>; that on December 12, he
was called to the municipal building (of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span>) where
he was investigated by PC investigator, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Yrigan</span>, in the presence of one <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>, a soldier-son of the deceased Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>, his answers to the questions asked being taken
down by ball-pen; that he was sent home, with instruction to return; when be

investigation, in the presence of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Yrigan</span> and
Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Valila</span>; that he was not able to read
the statement; that after he was asked to sign the pages of said statement, he
was allowed to go home; that having heard rumor that what he signed was a
confession, he went back to Judge <span class="SpellE">Valila</span> who told him
that there was nothing to what he signed; that on his way home, he was
arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">This accused disputed his extrajudicial admissions, charg­ing
that they were given involuntarily; that he signed them after he was maltreated
by <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span> in the
PC barracks on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1961</st1:date>;
that the pictures taken by witness Antonio Reyes during the reenactment were
under the direction of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Yrigan</span>, who instructed
him how to pose for them (the pictures).</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> (who did
not testify during the trial) tried to establish through <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mendador</span>, a <span class="GramE">neighbor, that</span>
he (Domingo) was in his house from <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of the 7th December until about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6
 o'clock</st1:time> of the following morning, preparing and drying his copra.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, accused Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>
testified that in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1961</st1:date>, he collected unpaid accounts from certain people; that at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, he

</span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Celespara</span>

Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> on <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1961</st1:date>; that he went to bed at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, Silvestre and his wife
were at the time in the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">On rebuttal, the prosecution presented, among others, Judge
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Valila</span>, the Justice of the Peace, who
testified that the statement, Exhibits K to K-3, were read and translated in
the dialect to accused Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>; that before <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> signed the statement, witness <span class="SpellE">Valila</span>
asked him if he (Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>) understood its
contents, to which the latter answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense likewise presented <span class="SpellE">sur</span>-rebuttal evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1964, the trial Court rendered judgment against
the three accused, finding them guilty as charged, of robbery with triple
homicide attended by five aggravating circumstances - evident premeditation,
treachery, dwelling, <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>, and the crime having
been committed by a band - without any mitigating circumstance and,
accordingly, sentenced all of them (Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>),
to death, and to pay, jointly and severally, the value of the taken goods in
the sum of P409.40, to indemnify the heirs of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>
in the sum of P6,000.00, the heirs of Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>
in the sum of P6,000.00, and the heirs of Daniel Rosita in the sum of
P6,000.00, and to pay 3/4 of the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now on automatic review by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The counsels <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> for Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>, and for Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>, contest the decision under
considera­tion, alleging that the trial Court committed error (1) in finding
that there was conspiracy among the three accused to commit the crime; (2) in
finding accused Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> guilty of robbery with triple homicide; (3) in
finding that the commission of the offense was attended by five aggravating circumstances;
and (4) in imposing on all of the three accused the maximum penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The role and participation of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
in the commission of this heinous crime - the slaying of three unarmed and
sleeping persons, one of them a 75-year old man and another a 15-year old boy,
to facilitate the taking of the victims’ odd personal belongings - has been
clearly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only did he
make two extrajudicial confessions of his guilt before the Mayor (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">D to D-3), and before Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Daling</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> N); he was
positively named by witness <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> as the one who disclosed the plan to rob Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span> on the night of December 7, 1961, and in fact he
was one of the three persons who went up the house where the bloody bodies of
the victims were found the following morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that during the trial, this accused repudiated his
previous extrajudicial admission, claiming that he signed the statements,
Exhibits D to D-3, without knowing its contents and in order to end the
maltreatment he was getting from the PC investigator and the soldier-son of the
deceased Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allega­tion that the confession was
extracted from him by force was not only uncorroborated, but was even denied by
the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> who witnessed the
signing and the Vice-Mayor before whom the statement was subscribed, and who
declared that it was read to and understood by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>,
and that it was signed freely and voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We also note that the statement contained details which were either
admitted by the accused as true during the trial, or corroborated by other
witnesses - such as the facts that Ricardo had a previous quarrel with
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>; that he took charge of two <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>;
that he knew that Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span> bad sold copra;
that Ricardo lost some money in a card game, and that the articles taken from
the house of <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span> were placed atop a "<span class="SpellE">patong</span>" or bamboo clump near Ricardo's house where
they were found, indicating that the information was furnished by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial Judge also made the observation that from the demeanor of this accused
while testifying, he (the Judge) was convinced that said accused was
unreliable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it may be pointed out that this accused stoutly
maintained during the trial that at the time when the robbery and killings were
supposed to be taking place, he was in the house of his mother-in-law in
another <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yet, in the statement he gave to the investigator on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1961</st1:date>, prior to his
arrest, and subscribed to before the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. K to K-2), <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> admitted being with the group of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>, Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> that same night,
committing the robbery and killing in the house of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>
in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pocdol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state, the Justice of the Peace
of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> testified in court that the statement,
Exhibits K to K-2, was given by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
voluntarily and under no compulsion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also admitted the homicide and robbery in his testimony before Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Daling</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. N).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is thus no doubt in our mind that
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> took part in the robbery and killing
of the three victims in this case, and the trial Court , therefore, correctly
ruled that his guilt and culpability were established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Question has been raised against the lower Court's finding that
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>
were co-conspirators of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>, it being
asserted that there was no adequate proof of the existence of the conspiracy,
as provided in Section 27 of the Revised Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">The testimony of discharged witness <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>, placing Domingo
<span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>
in the company of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> when the plan to
rob Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span> was revealed to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, indicating that they were in the plot, and were
with Ricardo in entering the house, is admissible evidence against Domingo and
Silvestre.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
where the same issue of the admissibility of the lone testimony of a
co-conspirator to prove conspiracy, was assigned, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The appellants contend further that in order that the
testimony of a conspirator may be admissible in evidence against his
co-conspirator, it must appear, and be shown by evidence other than the
admission itself that the conspiracy actually existed and that the person who
is to be bound by the admission was a privy to the conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as there is nothing but the lone
testimony of prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Reyes, a
co-conspirator, the trial court erred in finding that the conspiracy has been
established and in convicting the appellants based upon the lone testimony of
their co-conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention
does not merit serious consideration, because the rule that 'The act or
declaration of a relating to the conspiracy and during its existence, may be
given in evidence against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by
evidence other than such act or declaration,' applies only to extrajudicial
acts or declaration, but not to testimony given on the stand at the trial,
where the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>,
in this case, took the witness stand and testified on the participations of
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>
in the crime, he was not making an admission or declaration as a
co-conspirator; he was an eye-witness identifying them in connection with the
incident, and whose testimony could have been shaken by cross-examination or
disproved by other evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it
happened here, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio's</span> testimony pointing to the
existence of conspiracy among Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>,
remained and withstood cross-examinations by the separate counsel for the
accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense attacks the credibility of witness <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> on the basis of its coming from a polluted source,
and the improbability that this appellant should have been left behind by his
companions despite having expressed unwillingness to participate in the rob­bery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the latter circumstance, it must be
remembered that <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> had been threatened to keep
silent, and the effectiveness of the menace was such that he did not reveal
what he knew to the prosecution until after the information was filed (see
Record, p. 2; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Abata</span>,
pp. 4, 8, 54, 57).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His being a
co-conspirator demands, of course, that his testimony be regarded with
suspicion; yet, we can not close our eyes to the convincing detail that <span class="SpellE">Gremio's</span> version that appellants were together in
committing the crime is confirmed by the admissions of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> in his statement sworn to before Judge <span class="SpellE">Valila</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K) <span class="GramE">and</span> in his testimony at the investigation by Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Daling</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. N).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> is also
corroborated by the stolen articles belonging to the deceased (particularly the
belt and the violated piggy bank) found in Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio's</span>
farm, and the stolen T-shirt that accused Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
was wearing when arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">To bolster its case, the defense calls attention to erasures in
the caption of Exhibit D, the confession of December 15 (where Ricardo asserted
being the lone perpetrator), and theorizes that this was the first confession,
but that the inves­tigators forced <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> to
incriminate his companions in Exhibit K, dated December 13; to render the
latter more plausible, the date of the supposed first confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE">was</span> altered to December
15, so as to make it appear that it was made after December 13, when Exhibit K
was sworn to by said appellant before Judge <span class="SpellE">Valila</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ingenious and complicated theory is
discredited by the fact that examination under a magnifier reveals that the
date of Exhibit D (December 15) is unaltered, although typed twice because the
first "15" was only lightly imprinted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor do we find the <u>alibis</u> of herein accused-appellants
duly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendador</span>, a neighbor of
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dancalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,

 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1961</st1:date> until <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6 o'clock</st1:time>
of the following morning, does not appear credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unlikely that a disinterested person
would take note of what his neighbors are specifically doing at certain times
of the night of a particular day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guba</span> is
adjacent to <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pocdol</span>,
in the same barrio of <span class="SpellE">Dancalan</span>, does not also obviate
the possibility that in the intervening period, between 6 o'clock in the
afternoon of December 7, 1961, and 6 o'clock in the morning of December 8,
1961, accused Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> could have gone with
his brother and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> to the house of
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>, the testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Celespara</span> that
he saw Silvestre in the house before he (<span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>)
slept at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1961</st1:date> does not invalidate
the declarations of <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>
in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> is in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bantilen</span>, also in barrio <span class="SpellE">DancaIan</span>,
and the incident in the house of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span> in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pocdol</span> of the same barrio
was committed at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2 o'clock</st1:time> in
the morning of <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Casiano’s</span>
testimony may contradict <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio's</span> declaration that
Silvestre was with Ricardo and Domingo when the latter picked him up in their
house, still, that does not destroy the prosecution's evidence that Silvestre
was with the group when they reached the house of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>
and that he was one of the three armed men who ascended that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, we take note of <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Celespara's</span> testimony
that he learned of the death of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>,
Sebastian and Daniel Rosita at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1961</st1:date>,
when Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> informed him (<span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>), that he (Silvestre) would be implicated there.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span> It is
indeed strange that Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> should be able
to predict his involvement in the case that same morning when the bodies of the
victims were found, when even the investigator, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Yrigan</span>,
testified that their primary suspect was only Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
and it was only after the latter had given his statement on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1961</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">K to K-2) that the names of Domingo
<span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>, Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> came
into the picture.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The insinuation also that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio's</span>
testimony in court against the three accused was the reward for springing the
former out of incarceration does not appear convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as December 15, 1961, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> already owned sole responsibility for the crime,
there was actually no need for <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> to testify the way he did if his only purpose were
to save himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does the
contention of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> testified against him because his wife
reprimanded <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> when she caught the latter
getting their cassava and that she took <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio's</span>
empty trunk when he failed to pay a debt of P20.00, believable, in the absence
of proof that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>
is such a vindictive person who could charge another of so serious an offense
as the killing of three persons, just for the aforementioned reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the conspiracy, at least, to commit the robbery,
was shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record affords no other
cogent explana­tion why these appellants, armed with deadly bolos, should
repair to the house of the victims in the dead of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>, while they may not have
participated in the slaying of the victims, nevertheless, are liable for the
crime actually committed, for the rule is settled that when homicide takes
place as a consequence of or on the occasion of a robbery, all of those who
took part in the robbery shall be guilty as principals of the complex crime of
robbery with homicide, unless there is proof that they had endeavored to
prevent the killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;

could be added that when well-armed men proceed to a house with intent to rob,
it is because they are bent in using their lethal weapons to eliminate any
opposition that may develop.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the question of whether or not the crime was
really attended by the aggravating circumstances of band, evident
premeditation, nighttime, dwelling and treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of counsel for the accused, to which the Solicitor
General agrees, that the circumstance of band cannot be appreciated in this
case, must be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
circumstance of "<span class="SpellE">cuadrilIa</span>" to be
considered, it is necessary that there be more than three armed malefactors
acting together in the commission of the offense (Art. 14, <span class="SpellE">para</span>.
6, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears,
however, that while Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>
were equipped with bolos, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> was unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They, therefore, did not constitute a band within the contemplation of
the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the fact that the robbery was planned does not justify
the appreciation of the circumstance of evident pre­meditation, it being
inherent in robbery.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> Evident premeditation will only be
aggravating in a complex crime of robbery with homicide if it is proved that
the plan is not only to rob, but also to kill.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regard treachery, there is evidence that when the group
reached the place they had planned to rob, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>
first went around the house to listen and ascertain if the occupants therein
were all asleep; that perhaps so assured, they entered the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>, who was left downstairs, heard the voices of
two grown-ups and that of a child, and hacking or chopping sounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Capitalizing on this portion of the testimony of prosecu­tion witness
<span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>, the
accused argue that if the victims were not asleep when they met their death,
then the attack on them cannot be considered coupled with treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to this allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness stated that he heard the voices
and hacking sounds, presumably produced by the bolo used by the attacker or
attackers in inflicting injuries on the victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not say he heard conversations or
words denoting the victims' complete or full awareness of the presence of the
robbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sounds emitted by them
could have been groans or cries of pain when they received the injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, from the position of the body of the
old man, Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>, when it was found,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>
i.e., lying on the mat and still covered with his blanket, it can be deduced
that death came to him while he was asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, even assuming that the victims were suddenly roused by the
movements of the intruders in the house, their immediate slaying does not make
it less treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attack on a
person who has just awakened from sleep is considered attended by treachery,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a>
because the victim, who may still be dazed and unprepared for the attack, would
not be in a position to offer any risk or danger of retaliation to the
attacker.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the circumstance of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>,
contrary to the allegation of counsel for the accused, there is sufficient
proof that the <span class="SpellE">offernders</span> purposely sought nighttime
to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider the facts
that the trio of Ricardo, Domingo and Silvestre invited <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
to join them in a “good time" that evening;<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a> that they revealed that the plan
was to rob Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>; that they tried to
ascertain whether the occupants of the house were asleep, thereby indicating
the desire to carry out the plot with the least detection or to insure its
consummation with a minimum of resistance from the inmates of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This aggravating cir­cumstance was,
therefore, properly appreciated in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, there is no merit to the assertion that dwelling is
inherent in the crime committed in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim is untenable for while dwelling may
be appreciated as inherent in a case of simple robbery, it has been ruled that
the same cannot be said when the offense is robbery with violence or
intimidation against persons,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a> because in the latter instance,
the crime can be performed without need of violating the abode of the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, after due consideration of the evidence herein
presented, we declare the accused Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span>,
all guilty as principals of the complex crime of robbery with triple homicide, attended
by the aggravating circumstances of treachery, nighttime and dwelling, without
any mitigating circumstance to offset them, for which the appropriate penalty
is death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, while the members of the
Court agree that this penalty imposed upon appellant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> should be affirmed, there is divergence as to its
application in the case of the other appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of necessary votes, therefore, the penalty
meted out to <span class="GramE">accused</span> Domingo <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
and Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Colisao</span> is reduced to life imprisonment
(<u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three, however, shall pay jointly and
severally the value of the stolen goods amounting to P409.40, and indemnify the
heirs of Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span> in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; the heirs of Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Rapsing</span>,
in the like sum of P6,000.00; and the heirs of Daniel Rosita also in the sum of
P6,000.00; besides, they shall pay 3/4 of the costs.</p>
