				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These two petitions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for the review of a joint decision of respondent Court of Appeals, sustaining the right of respondent-landholder, Enrique Zobel&nbsp; to eject petitioner-tenants and thus reversing a judgment in their favor by the Court of Agrarian Relations, present the crucial issue of how far this Tribunal is bound by the cardinal policy set forth in a presidential decree<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> that ordains the emancipation of tenants and confers on them ownership of the lands they till, upheld as part of the law of the land under the Revised Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> This too, in the face of its avowed primordial objective:&nbsp; "The State shall formulate and implement an agrarian reform program aimed at emancipating the tenant from the bondage of the soil and achieving the goals enunciated in this Constitution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> As thus posed, its resolution is rather obvious.&nbsp; We cannot sustain respondent Court of Appeals.<br><br>Private respondent Zobel, as the registered owner of a parcel of land located at Calatagan, Batangas, known as Hacienda Bigaa, with an aggregate area of more than five hundred hectares, sought to eject petitioners, his tenants tilling lands in a portion thereof, relying on the provision of Republic Act No. 1199, which would justify such a move where the land is suited for mechanization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Petitioners, as tenants, vigorously objected to such petition not only on the ground that the small areas they are occupying were not suited for mechanization, but likewise on the allegation that the true intention of respondent as landholder was to utilize the same for pasture and for the raising of sorghum.&nbsp; The Court of Agrarian Relations dismissed the petition for ejectment, doubting such an intent to mechanize and at the same time holding that mechanization during the rainy season of the year was not practicable.&nbsp; The matter was elevated to respondent Court of Appeals, which reversed the Court of Agrarian Relations and granted such petition for ejectment.&nbsp; Hence this petition for review.<br><br>There is no question as to the tenancy relationship as well as to the areas occupied by petitioners as tenants.&nbsp; For the decision of the Court of Appeals now sought to be reviewed did clearly specify:&nbsp; "At the hearing of these cases on July 15, 1963, the litigants, through their counsels, entered into the following stipulation of facts:&nbsp; 1. That the relation of landholder and tenant between the petitioner and the respondents is admitted; 2.&nbsp; That the respective area cultivated by each of the respondents is as indicated * * * as follows:&nbsp; Bartolome Dimaala - 1 lot with an approximate area of 1.1440 hectare; Rufo Garcia - area of lot is more or less one (1) hectare; Paulino Esguerra - two (2) lots with an aggregate area of about two (2) hectares; Fernando Veroya - one (1) lot with an area of about 1/2 hectare; Wilson Zapatero - one (1) lot with an area of about less than 1-1/2 hectares; Rufino Zapatero - one (1) lot with an area of about one (1) hectare; Almario Alab - three (3) lots with an area of about 3 hectares; Roman Veroya - one (1) lot of about 1/2 hectare; Romana Vizconde - one (1) lot with an area of about 1/2 hectare; and Zoila de Chavez - four (4) lots with an aggregate area of about 6 hectares."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> That is why, as set forth at the outset, the applicability of Presidential Decree No. 27 decreeing the emancipation of tenants from the bondage of the soil and transferring to them the ownership of the land they till and providing the instruments and mechanism therefor is unavoidable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Hence, again, as was made mention of at the outset, the decision of the Court of Appeals cannot be sustained.<br><br>1. The tenancy problem in the Philippines is of ancient vintage. The opinion of Justice Tuason in the leading case of Guido vs. Rural Progress Administration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> made reference to the concern shown by our great patriot and hero, Jose Rizal, one arising from first-hand knowledge and the bitter personal experience of his family.&nbsp; As was so vividly expressed by Justice Labrador, speaking for this Court, in De Ramas vs. Court of Agrarian Relations:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> "The history of land tenancy, especially in Central Luzon, is a dark spot in the social life and history of the people.&nbsp; It was among the tenants of Central Luzon that the late Pedro Abad Santos, acting as a saviour of the tenant class, which for generations has been relegated to a life of bondage, without hope of salvation or improvement, enunciated a form of socialism as a remedy for the pitiful condition of the tenants of Central Luzon.&nbsp; It was in Central Luzon also that the tenants forming the PKM organization of tenants and, during the war, the Hukbalahap, rose in arms against the constituted authority as their only salvation from permanent thralldom.&nbsp; According to statistics, whereas at the beginning of the century we had only 19% of the people belonging to the tenant class, after 60 years, the prevailing percentage has reached 39%."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Such situation calls to mind this apt observation of Laski, "of the normal life of the poor, their perpetual fear of the morrow, their haunting sense of impending disaster, their fitful search for a beauty which perpetually eludes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The 1935 delegates to the Constitutional Convention were not unaware of the gravity of the problem. Under the Commonwealth and under the Republic therefore, the appropriate legislation was enacted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Progress in the solution of this serious social malady, while considerable, did not supply the necessary corrective.<br><br>On this vital policy question, one of the utmost concern, the need for what for some is a radical solution in its pristine sense, one that goes at the root, was apparent.&nbsp; Presidential Decree No. 27 was thus conceived.&nbsp; It was issued in October of 1972.&nbsp; The very next month, the 1971 Constitutional Convention voiced its overwhelming approval.&nbsp; There is no doubt then, as set forth expressly therein, that the goal is emancipation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> What is more, the decree is now part and parcel of the law of the land according to the revised Constitution itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Ejectment therefore of petitioners is simply out of the question.&nbsp; That would be to set at naught an express mandate of the Constitution.&nbsp; Once it has spoken, our duty is clear; obedience is unavoidable.&nbsp; This is not only so because of the cardinal postulate of constitutionalism, the supremacy of the fundamental law.&nbsp; It is also because any other approach would run the risk of setting at naught this basic aspiration to do away with all remnants of a feudalistic order at war with the promise and the hope associated with an open society.&nbsp; To deprive petitioners of the small landholdings in the face of a presidential decree considered ratified by the new Constitution and precisely in accordance with its avowed objective could indeed be contributory to perpetuating the misery that tenancy had spawned in the past as well as the grave social problems thereby created. There can be no justification for any other decision then whether predicated on a juridical norm or on the traditional role assigned to the judiciary of implementing and not thwarting fundamental policy goals.<br><br>2. With the disposition of these petitions for review thus so clearly indicated by the controlling constitutional provisions, a discussion of the errors assigned by petitioners would be fruitless.&nbsp; Nonetheless, insofar as they would stress the basic doctrine that the findings of fact of the Court of Agrarian Relations, supported by substantial evidence, is well-nigh conclusive on an appellate tribunal, it is undeniable that such a submission is supported and buttressed by a host of our decisions dating back to 1958.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the joint decision in these two petitions of respondent Court of Appeals of November 23, 1967 is reversed and set aside, and the joint decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations of October 1, 1964 dismissing the actions filed by respondent Enrique Zobel is reinstated and given full force and effect.&nbsp; Costs against respondent Enrique Zobel.<br><br><i>Zaldivar, (Chairman)</i> and <i>Aquino, JJ., </i>concur.<br><i>Barredo, J.,</i> concurs in a separate opinion.<br><i>Antonio</i> and <i>Fernandez, JJ.,</i> concur as qualified by the separate opinion of Justice Barredo.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> L-28609 is entitled Zoila de <i style="font-style: italic;">Chavez vs.</i><span style="font-style: italic;"> Enrique</span> Zobel, et al. and L-Â­28610 is entitled Bartolome Dimaala, et al. vs. Enrique Zobel, et al.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Presidential Decree No. 27, entitled "Decreeing the Emancipation of Tenants From the Bondage of the Soil Transferring to Them the Ownership of the Land They Till and Providing The Instruments and Mechanism Therefor" (October 21, 1972).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> According to Article XVII, Section 3, par.&nbsp; (2) of the Revised Constitution' "All proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent President shall be part of the law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding, and effective even after lifting of martial law or the ratification of this Constitution, unless modified, revoked, or superseded by subsequent proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, or other acts of the incumbent President, or unless expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National Assembly."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Article XIV, Section 12 of the Revised Constitution.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Section 50 of Republic Act No. 1199 (1954).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Decision, Annex A of Petition, 2-3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Presidential Decree No. 27 reads as follows:&nbsp; "Inasmuch as the old concept of land ownership by a few has spawned valid and legitimate grievances that gave rise to violent conflict and social tension, [t]he redress of such legitimate grievances being one of the fundamental objectives of the New Society, [s]ince Reformation must start with the emancipation of the tiller of the soil from his bondage, [n]ow, [t]herefore, I, Ferdinand E.

In other words, the replacement is integral, and, accordingly, the ratification and approval of the new one should be determined by its own effectivity clause, it being undeniable that the previous constitution, while it provides for an amending process, is completely silent as to how an integral replacement thereof may be effected.&nbsp; Which is how it ought to be, for it is to me but logical, if it cannot be deemed axiomatic, that as a new fundamental law is ordained precisely in disregard, if not in repudiation, of its predecessor, it is incongruous that the latter should in any way bind the hands of the people in enacting the former.&nbsp; I have said once before that a constitution is by its very nature always self-born or comes into effect by the force of its own authority, expressive of the people's sovereignty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and I have not yet been shown any reason why I should believe otherwise.&nbsp; Actually, if one must be accurate, the innovations introduced by the new constitution in its underlying principles as well as in the provisions regarding the form and theory of our government, the rights and obligations of the citizens, the conditions of citizenship, the voting age, the national economy and society in general, but more particularly, the eradication of social injustice, the judicial set up, the accountability of public officers, the autonomy of local governments, the preservation and protection of the national patrimony and the reorientation of the educational system, to mention only some of them, are so substantial and far reaching that only blind loyalty to the old order could make anyone insist that the former charter has merely suffered amendments of form and language and that the Philippine Constitution of 1973 is not a new one.&nbsp; Withal, having taken a sacred oath on October 29, 1973 that "aking itataguyod at ipagtatanggol and <i>bagong</i> Saligang-Batas", I am as solemnly bound not to ever consider the present charter as anything less than new.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See, my separate opinion in the Ratification Cases, Javellana vs. The Executive Secretary and the other cases decided with it, March 31, 1973, 50 SCRA 30, 197-198.<br></div>
