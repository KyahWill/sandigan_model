				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This &nbsp;is a petition &nbsp;for a &nbsp;writ &nbsp;of certiorari &nbsp;to &nbsp;review a judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming that rendered &nbsp;by the Court of &nbsp;First &nbsp;Instance of Manila in &nbsp;Civil Case &nbsp;No. 34025. In this Court the petitioner assigns the &nbsp;following errors claimed to have been committed by the &nbsp;Courts of Appeals: <blockquote> <p>(1) in not holding that, by their inadequate &nbsp;allegations &nbsp;in the complaint as &nbsp;well &nbsp;as their &nbsp;&nbsp;immaterial &nbsp;evidence &nbsp;adduced &nbsp;during the trial, the respondents failed to establish liability &nbsp;on the part of the petitioner to pay them P1 ,500.00;</p> <p>(2) in admitting in evidence check for PI,500 (Exhibit G) &nbsp;which was not &nbsp;alleged &nbsp;in &nbsp;the complaint;</p> <p>(3) in leaving unsolved the petitioner's motion for new trial;</p> <p>(4) in not holding that the respondent's claim for Pl,086.0O was already &nbsp; paid;</p> <p>(5) in not holding that plaintiff's claim for P14,500 &nbsp;was neither adequately &nbsp;alleged in the complaint nor &nbsp;proved during &nbsp;the &nbsp;trial;</p> <p>(6) in admitting in evidence the power of attorney (Exh. F) &nbsp;with which respondents &nbsp;intend &nbsp;to &nbsp; prove their above claim of PI4,500;</p> <p>(7) in holding that &nbsp;Exh. &nbsp;F &nbsp;(power of attorney) alone constitutes &nbsp;sufficient &nbsp;evidence &nbsp;that Mrs. &nbsp;Raquiza owed the &nbsp;Ofiladas P14,500; and</p> <p>(8) &nbsp;in admitting &nbsp;Exhs. &nbsp;G, &nbsp;G-l, G-2 and G-3 against the objection of the defendant for not being &nbsp;alleged in the complaint.</p> </blockquote> <p>The &nbsp;findings of &nbsp;the Court of &nbsp;Appeals &nbsp;are the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>"It appears that &nbsp;sometime &nbsp;in July 1950, plaintiff Raymunda G. Ofilada purchased from a certain Rufina Vinoya a pair &nbsp;of diamond earrings for Pl,500. &nbsp;But to accommodate defendant Natividad Castellvi Raquiza, the &nbsp;earring had previously been pledged &nbsp;by &nbsp;Mrs. Vinoya to one Mrs. &nbsp;Maria de Guzman. &nbsp;In &nbsp;&nbsp;order to &nbsp; redeem the jewelry, &nbsp;the buyer &nbsp;thereof &nbsp;issued &nbsp;a &nbsp;check &nbsp;&nbsp;(Exh. "C") &nbsp;in the amount of Pl,500.00 in favor of Mrs. Raquiza for the &nbsp;redemption of the articles pledged. &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;check &nbsp;was cashed at &nbsp;the Philippine National &nbsp;Bank &nbsp;by Mrs. &nbsp;Raquiza who &nbsp;did not utilize &nbsp;the money for the purchase intended. Thus, &nbsp;no &nbsp;earrings &nbsp;were delivered to Mrs. Ofilada.</p> <p>The &nbsp;paying teller &nbsp;of the Philippine National Bank by the name of Pedro &nbsp;Melendrez positively declared that the check was cashed by Mrs. &nbsp;Raquiza. &nbsp;&nbsp;He testified thus—</p> <p></p><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">Q.</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Would you &nbsp;tell the &nbsp;Court the &nbsp;procedure &nbsp;when &nbsp;a &nbsp;check is presented to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When a check is presented to &nbsp;me for payment I verify the signature of the drawer; after &nbsp;verifying the &nbsp;signature of the drawer &nbsp;I send the check to the &nbsp;bookkeeper for &nbsp;further verification of &nbsp; the &nbsp;drawer's signature and the balance'; then &nbsp;the check &nbsp;is given to me for &nbsp; payment. &nbsp;Before I pay the check, of &nbsp;course I will have to let the payee, &nbsp;the one who is cashing the &nbsp;check, to sign in my &nbsp;presence.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="LEFT">Q. </div></td> <td>I am showing to you now a PNB check bearing No. 2094321-K which has been marked as Exhibit C, do you know this check?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A.</div></td> <td>Yes. </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Do you know the &nbsp;person who &nbsp;cashed this check?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A. &nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Of &nbsp;course the signature &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;back will &nbsp;show &nbsp;that &nbsp;she was &nbsp;the one &nbsp;who cashed the check.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q.</div></td> <td>Who cashed &nbsp;the check? </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A. &nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Natividad Raquiza.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="LEFT">Q. </div></td> <td>Do I get &nbsp;you right that before you paid this check to Mrs. Natividad C.

C. &nbsp;Ofilada the amount &nbsp;of &nbsp;Pl,086.50 before December &nbsp;31, 1950. </p> <p align="RIGHT">(Sgd.) &nbsp;Natividad Raquiza<br> Horse Shoe Drive" </p> <blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">(Exhibit "A")</p> </blockquote> <p>On &nbsp;July &nbsp;23, 1956, &nbsp;Mrs. Raquiza &nbsp;executed a &nbsp;special power of attorney &nbsp;in favor of Mrs. 'Carmen &nbsp;Vda. &nbsp;de Castellvi authorizing her to pay &nbsp;the total &nbsp;amount of P14.500.00 to &nbsp;Mrs. Raymunda C. Ofilada &nbsp;and &nbsp;Mrs. &nbsp;Andrea &nbsp;Ofilada &nbsp;Veneracion.</p> <p>Defendant, however, &nbsp; insists that the amount of &nbsp;PI,086.50 &nbsp;which she had &nbsp;promised to &nbsp;pay &nbsp; before &nbsp;December &nbsp;31, &nbsp;1950, &nbsp;to plaintiff Raymunda C. &nbsp;Ofilada &nbsp;had &nbsp;already been paid &nbsp;in &nbsp;behalf &nbsp;of &nbsp;the former by a certain Mrs. Castellvi who was said to have paid the sum of &nbsp;P2,000.00 &nbsp;(t.s.n., p. &nbsp;55, &nbsp;April &nbsp; 10, &nbsp;&nbsp;1955). &nbsp;But, the promissory note evidencing the indebtedness &nbsp;(Exh. "A") &nbsp;has not been retrieved &nbsp;from &nbsp;the creditor, &nbsp;plaintiff &nbsp;Mrs. &nbsp;Ofilada, &nbsp;and there is is nothing on its bare &nbsp;face to &nbsp;show &nbsp;that &nbsp;it &nbsp;was ever paid &nbsp;by the promissor defendant Natividad &nbsp;Raquiza, who admitted &nbsp;having executed &nbsp;the &nbsp;same &nbsp;(t.s.n., p. 18, January 23, 1958) &nbsp;Under this circumstance, we could &nbsp;not &nbsp;believe that &nbsp;plaintiff Ofilada would have the temerity of going to the extent of suing herein &nbsp;defendant if the latter &nbsp;had already &nbsp;satisfied &nbsp;her indebtedness &nbsp;as &nbsp;embodied in &nbsp;Exhibit &nbsp;"A". &nbsp;If the creditor required &nbsp;the debtor &nbsp;to sign &nbsp;the corresponding promissory &nbsp;note &nbsp;(Exh. &nbsp;"A"), &nbsp;like, in &nbsp;the &nbsp;instant case, &nbsp;then the &nbsp;latter &nbsp;should &nbsp;have reasonably asked the &nbsp;former to hand &nbsp;in the note and to indicate thereon that the same has already been &nbsp;paid. &nbsp;That is the normal &nbsp;and ordinary way &nbsp;of dealing &nbsp;on this kind of &nbsp;transaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;And &nbsp;since this has not &nbsp;been &nbsp;done, &nbsp;we are not &nbsp;inclined, much less satisfied, &nbsp;to &nbsp;believe defendant's pretension that she had already paid her obligation under Exhibit "A".</p> <p>The complaint as well &nbsp;as &nbsp;the evidence satisfactorily establishes the fact &nbsp;that &nbsp;herein &nbsp;defendant is &nbsp;&nbsp;under &nbsp;obligation &nbsp;to &nbsp;plaintiff Ofilada in the sum &nbsp;of Pl,500.00 which was advanced to the former by the latter in the form &nbsp;of a check for the purpose of&nbsp;&nbsp; redeeming the pair &nbsp;of &nbsp;diamond &nbsp;earrings &nbsp;from &nbsp;a &nbsp;certain &nbsp;Mrs. &nbsp;Maria de Guzman. Defendant, however, did not redeem &nbsp;the &nbsp;precious articles and so nothing was delivered to &nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. &nbsp;Ofilada who lost &nbsp;money and earrings. &nbsp;This is &nbsp;what &nbsp;they &nbsp;say &nbsp;in ordinary parlance "por nada". Of course defendant in trying &nbsp;to shake off liability &nbsp;under the check denied having &nbsp; cashed &nbsp;the same, &nbsp;for, according to her, the signature appearing at &nbsp;the &nbsp;back thereof &nbsp;is not &nbsp;her &nbsp;genuine signature. &nbsp;In other words, she &nbsp;wants us to believe that somebody had forged her signature &nbsp;and thereafter &nbsp;the &nbsp;forger or somebody else &nbsp;cashed &nbsp;the check. &nbsp;But, the &nbsp;paying &nbsp;teller, who &nbsp;does &nbsp;not appear to have any ill-motive towards &nbsp;herein &nbsp;defendant, positively declared &nbsp;that she &nbsp;was the &nbsp;very one &nbsp;who signed &nbsp;the &nbsp;check &nbsp;&nbsp;on the back as payee. &nbsp;While &nbsp;there &nbsp;is &nbsp;&nbsp;an &nbsp;apparent &nbsp;dissimilarity between &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;admittedly genuine signature &nbsp;of the defendant &nbsp;and the signature appearing on the &nbsp;back of &nbsp;the check, yet &nbsp;we cannot rule out &nbsp;or &nbsp;do away with &nbsp;the &nbsp;testimony &nbsp;of the teller who, from all indications, &nbsp; simply testified on what &nbsp;he knew. &nbsp;It &nbsp;may be &nbsp;stated in this &nbsp;connection &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;signature appearing &nbsp;at the &nbsp;bottom of Exhibit "A" end those appearing &nbsp;on &nbsp;Exhibits &nbsp;"F" and "G" are not &nbsp;quite similar—an &nbsp; indication that defendant at times sign her name &nbsp;in different ways. &nbsp;For this reason, it &nbsp;would not &nbsp;be reasonable to say that she may have signed her name in a different way she cashed the &nbsp;check &nbsp;(Exh. "C".) &nbsp;For all these &nbsp;considerations, we hold and &nbsp; declare that &nbsp;plaintiff never &nbsp;put up a theory different from &nbsp;what she alleged in the complaint about &nbsp;Exhibit &nbsp;"B".</p> <p>The check &nbsp;(Exh. &nbsp;"C") is an evidence &nbsp;in support of what has been alleged in the &nbsp;complaint regarding &nbsp;the transaction relating to &nbsp;the pair of earrings that were &nbsp;previously &nbsp;pledged &nbsp;to Mrs. Maria de Guzman and later on sold by Mrs. Vinoya to herein plaintiff. &nbsp;It was &nbsp;established that &nbsp;the &nbsp;pledge was constituted &nbsp;for &nbsp;the benefit of the defendant. It &nbsp;is not &nbsp;true &nbsp;that &nbsp;plaintiffs failed &nbsp;to adequately &nbsp;alleged in the complaint &nbsp;the &nbsp;claim of &nbsp;P14,500.00. &nbsp;It &nbsp;is &nbsp;enough to &nbsp;reproduce in this connection the &nbsp;pertinent &nbsp;paragraph—</p> <p>"6. That on July 23, 1956, &nbsp; defendant herein executed &nbsp;a power of attorney in &nbsp;favor &nbsp;of Carmen &nbsp;Vda. de Castellvi for the &nbsp;purpose of &nbsp;paying the sum of P14,500.00 &nbsp;to &nbsp;the plaintiffs herein as shown in &nbsp;said special power of attorney &nbsp;a copy of which is hereto attached and marked as Annex &nbsp;"D" &nbsp;which forms &nbsp;a part of this complaint."</p> <p>It should also be &nbsp;stated that defendant &nbsp;admitted the genuiness of her signature appearing on the special power &nbsp;of attorney &nbsp;(Exh. "F", &nbsp;authorizing her &nbsp;attorney-in-fact, &nbsp;Mrs. Carmen Vda. &nbsp;de &nbsp;Castellvi, to pay &nbsp;Mrs. &nbsp;R. C. &nbsp;Ofilada and Mrs. Andrea Ofilada &nbsp;Veneracion the total sum of P14,500.00.</p> <p>The special power of &nbsp;attorney &nbsp;(Exh. "F") is written in &nbsp;English, a &nbsp;language which, we &nbsp;can reasonably say, &nbsp;is understood by the executor thereof, Mrs. Castellvi &nbsp;Raquiza, &nbsp;considering that she testified in said language (Pis. see &nbsp;t.s.n., p. 17, &nbsp;hearing, Jan. &nbsp;21, 1958). For this reason, &nbsp;we &nbsp;cannot &nbsp;reasonably say &nbsp;that she was duped &nbsp;to sign the same. &nbsp;We &nbsp;are, therefore, satisfied &nbsp;that &nbsp;Exhibit "F" was &nbsp;duly &nbsp; executed &nbsp;for &nbsp;some lawful &nbsp;obligation, &nbsp;and &nbsp;not &nbsp;for any undesirable purpose.</p> <p>Exhibits &nbsp;"G", "G-l" and G-3" were &nbsp;correctly admitted, for they may be considered for whatever they are worth in connection with the allegations in the complaint and &nbsp; other &nbsp;evidence &nbsp;duly presented. It may be &nbsp;stated that &nbsp;defendant's counsel interposed &nbsp;his objection as to the admission of Exhibit "G-2" &nbsp;only. &nbsp;All &nbsp;of these Exhibits ("G", "G-l" &amp; &nbsp;"G-2") reflect the sale of &nbsp;defendants &nbsp;share in the expropriated &nbsp;estate of her late father, &nbsp;Alfonso Catellvi. &nbsp;Plaintiff Raymunda &nbsp; G. Ofilada declared that &nbsp;"everytime &nbsp;she sold to me a portion of &nbsp;her &nbsp;land &nbsp;she &nbsp;executed a document, and these &nbsp;are the documents that &nbsp;she executed &nbsp; (t.s.n., &nbsp;pp. &nbsp;21-24, Jan. 10, 1958). &nbsp;&nbsp;A cursory reading of &nbsp;Exhibits "G", &nbsp;"G-l", "G-2" and "G-3" readily confirms the sale to Mrs. Ofilada and &nbsp;Mrs. Veneracion of defendants participation in &nbsp;the estate of her late father."</p> </blockquote> <p>Ultimate &nbsp;and not evidentiary &nbsp;facts &nbsp;are &nbsp;to be &nbsp;pleaded in a &nbsp;complaint. &nbsp;The &nbsp;test of &nbsp;sufficiency of a &nbsp;complaint is, could a competent court render a valid judgment upon the facts alleged in it if admitted or proved? &nbsp;If it could, then &nbsp;the &nbsp;allegations are sufficient. &nbsp;The indebtedness of the petitioner has been established as found by the Court of Appeals. &nbsp;This Court does &nbsp;not find any error of &nbsp;law claimed by &nbsp;the petitioner to have been committed by the Court of Appeals, except an error of fact upon which this Court is not allowed to pass. &nbsp;&nbsp;The error is to have taken into account Exhibit G &nbsp;executed by the &nbsp;petitioner on 17 February 1958 and Exhibit &nbsp;G-2 &nbsp;executed on 16 &nbsp;May 1957 &nbsp;to support &nbsp;in part the items &nbsp;of P12,000.00 &nbsp;and P900.00 appearing in the special power of &nbsp;attorney &nbsp;(Exhibit &nbsp;F, Annex D to the complaint) executed on &nbsp;23 &nbsp;July 1956. &nbsp;If, as testified to by respondent Ofilada, the special power of attorney executed &nbsp;by the petitioner on &nbsp;23 &nbsp;July 1956 &nbsp;in favor of Carmen Vda. &nbsp;de Castellvi, was a &nbsp;consolidation of all the receipts signed by the petitioner for money &nbsp;paid by the former and received &nbsp;by &nbsp;the latter, then &nbsp; Exhibits G and G-2, receipts signed by the petitioner on &nbsp;17 &nbsp;February &nbsp;1958 &nbsp;and &nbsp;16 &nbsp;May &nbsp;1957, respectively, long &nbsp;after the execution of the special power of attorney (Exhibit &nbsp;F) &nbsp;on &nbsp;23 July &nbsp;1956, &nbsp;could not &nbsp;have been included in the amounts appearing in Exhibit F. &nbsp;But the Court of Appeals found that &nbsp; counsel for the &nbsp;petitioner, contrary &nbsp;to his claim, objected &nbsp;to the &nbsp;admission of Exhibit &nbsp;G-2 only. &nbsp;Be that &nbsp;as it may, the fact &nbsp;is &nbsp;that in Exhibit F &nbsp;the petitioner acknowledged to be indebted to &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondents &nbsp;in the sums therein stated and authorized Carmen Vda. de Castellvi to pay the sums to the respondents.</p> <p>The third error assigned is untenable, because by finally deciding the case without even &nbsp; mention &nbsp;of the new &nbsp;trial prayed for, the &nbsp;Court in effect denied the motion. The &nbsp;judgment under review &nbsp;is &nbsp;affirmed, without &nbsp;pronouncement as to costs in this instance.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C.J., &nbsp;Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, &nbsp;Paredes, &nbsp;Dizon, &nbsp;Regala,</i> &nbsp;and &nbsp;<i>Makalintal, </i>&nbsp;JJ., concur </p> </div>
