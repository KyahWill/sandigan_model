29, 1973 by Mr. Jaime Bernal with the Department of Justice denouncing Mr. <span class="SpellE">Antoliano</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, then supply
officer of the Department of Justice, who was transferred to this Court, as the
intermediary of then Assistant City Fiscal Angel P. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>

in seeking allegedly to extort P25,000.00 from him (Mr. Bernal) in
consideration of a favorable decision in Civil Case No. 83352 entitled
"Jaime Bernal vs. NAWASA, et al."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it should be clearly understood that while in the
course of this decision the evidence of record is discussed with specific
reference to then Assistant City Fiscal Angel P. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
and his alleged scheme to extort P25,000.00 from Jaime Bernal with respondent
as his alleged collector and intermediary, such discussion should not be taken
to pass upon or make a finding (explicitly or implicitly) of former Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima's</span> guilt, since he is not a respondent and has not
been investigated in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1973</st1:date>,
the Department of Justice sent a letter to <span class="SpellE">Antoliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> requiring him to submit a written answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter is quoted in full:</p>

<blockquote>"This Office has found that a prima facie case exists against
you for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and/or
dishonesty in that around 10:00 a.m., on <u>January 30, 1973</u>, in the
Department of Justice Canteen, <u>you introduced and represented yourself to
Mr. Jesus Bernal, operator of said canteen, as the person sent by Fiscal Angel <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> to collect a sum of money being extorted from Mr.
Bernal in connection with his pending case in Branch VII, Court of First
Instance, Manila, and that you even urged Mr. Bernal to expedite the payment of
said money.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

counsel."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In an answer dated <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1973</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> denied the accusation and
averred that it has no basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an
affidavit dated <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1973</st1:date>
attached to his answer, <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> stated the following:</p>

came to my office to requisition some supplies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While waiting for the supplies, she sat on the chair beside me and
related to me that there is a case pending in the Court of First Instance of
Manila under Judge <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> and that Mrs. Bernal,
operator of the DJ canteen, requested her to talk to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
about the same;</p>

while I was in my office, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> came in and told me that somebody was waiting
outside and wanted to see me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
looked out of the door, I saw Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> in his
car so I approached him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invited me
for snack, but I declined because I had just taken coffee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He later told me that he was looking for
somebody whose name he did not mention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he was turning his car to the left in front of the Department
gasoline station, he saw a man coming down the stairs of the ground floor of
the Department, whom I later learned to be Mr. Bernal, at the sight of whom, he
said, '<span class="SpellE">Ayan</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">pala</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we
parted ways and I went back to the office;</p>

while I was having snack at the Department canteen and at the precise time that
I was paying the chit to Mrs. Bernal, I remember the visit to me of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> so I asked her in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>,
'I think Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> was looking for your husband
yesterday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were they able to see each
other?' She answered in the affirmative;</p>

<p class="BODY">The Secretary of Justice, under Administrative Order No. 32 dated
<st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1973</st1:date>, assigned
this case for investigation, report and recommendation to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> T. de Guzman of the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1973</st1:date>, he submitted his report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent portion of this report reads:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears from the testimony of the complainant Jaime Bernal
and his wife, Elvira Bernal, that on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1973</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Antoliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
went to the Department of Justice canteen and introduced himself to them as the
Supply Officer of the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent told them <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that he had been named by Ex-Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> to receive
the money he was demanding from complainants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"13.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
said that you had an understanding with Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
last Wednesday, what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'A
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following day, Tuesday, about
10:00 in the morning a certain Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> of the
Department of Justice, the property officer, introduced himself to my wife and
told her that he was sent by Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> to
inform her that Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> and Judge <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> were very disappointed with what happened during
the previous Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was approaching
my wife, I was introduced to him, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me that he was the man whom Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> assigned to collect the money the previous Friday
and he is also the same fellow who was seen by some of the people who helped me
to approach Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>, who came inside
the car of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> after we came to see
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> and later disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
also talked to him about our meeting at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Cultural</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I left the fellow while he was eating and I
went to my office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About an hour later I
returned to the canteen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife told me
that Judge <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span>, the Judicial Superintendent of the
Department of Justice would like to talk to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I went out to see Judge <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span> but as I
came out of the canteen, one of my friends told me that Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> is inside the office of Judge <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So instead of going inside the office of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span>, I went to the Office of Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> and told him about what is happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Undersecretary told me that it will be
better if I will not see Judge <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span> for it may
prejudice our plans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was coming out
of the office of Sec. <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> I saw <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> Francisco, Jr. coming out of the office of Judge <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me
that it was Judge <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span> who informed Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> that I had made a complaint against the
Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That afternoon I came here at
the NBI and informed Regional Director Nestor Gonzales of what had happened' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B, Q &amp; Ans. No. 13, Statement of J. Bernal).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In his explanation, respondent admitted having been present
at the D.J. Canteen on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="1">January 30,
 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, alleged
that the following was the only remark he made to Mrs. Bernal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
was looking for your husband yesterday, did they see each other?' He denied
ever talking to complainant Mr. J. Bernal.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">"'(c) The next
day, at about 10:00 in the morning, while I was having a snack at the
Department Canteen and at the precise time that I was paying the chit to Mrs.
Bernal, I remembered the visit to me of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
so I asked her in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'I think Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
was looking for your husband yesterday.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were they able to see each other?' She answered in the affirmative' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 14-A, Statement of A. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>).</p>

<blockquote>"The liability of the herein respondent rests principally on the
credibility of his testimony as against those of the complaining witnesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defense suggests that the claims of complainant in the
said civil case were grossly exaggerated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, it is alleged, supports the view that it was complainant who took
the initiative in offering the P25,000 bribe to obtain a favorable court
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, complainant
insists on the legitimacy of his claim for damages in the civil case and
maintains that it was ex-Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> who
solicited the bribe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above recitals of the parties, though conflicting,
establish the existence of an attempt to subvert justice in the civil case in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a determination as to
whether it was complainant or Ex-Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> who
suggested the giving of a bribe appears to be irrelevant, I find it necessary
to inquire into said question if only to place the statements of said parties
in their proper perspectives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, the undersigned believes that if complainant Jaime Bernal, who is
also the plaintiff in Civil Case No. 83352 of the CFI, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
is as smart and shrewd as pictured by the defense, his offering of such a large
bribe is improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
complainant would have realized that whatever advantage he can obtain in the
lower court can still be obliterated by an unfavorable appellate judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The version of respondent to my mind, would
have deserved credence if the advantage allegedly sought by complainant with
the bribe he allegedly <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> were a compromise
agreement that would be the object of the decision in the civil case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because elevating the case on
appeal in such an event would be precluded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another circumstance which suggests the veracity of the
allegations of the complaining witnesses is the absence of any motive on their
part to perjure themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
subscribe to the contention of the defense that respondent was implicated in
the extortion plot, which they describe as part of an 'illegitimate scheme for
revenge' simply because he works in the Department of Justice and is a <span class="SpellE">townmate</span> of Ex-Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I find it preposterous to assume
that complainant would impute derogatory remarks to one whom they did not know
or meet before the incident at bar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'Q.<span style=""> </span>According to you, there have been no incident between you and Mr.
Bernal and there was no occasion that you have seen Mrs. Bernal and Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> in conversation at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can you think of other reasons why these
people want to put you down and make false assertions against you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, there is one that I could think of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They know that we are <span class="SpellE">townmates</span>
with Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If I may be allowed to add this - on one occasion Sergeant Morales of
the Operation Warrant of Arrest, one Saturday, according to him, they were
together with Mr. Bernal the night before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then upon the prodding of Bernal, Sergeant Morales asked me if I could
testify against Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> and the Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I politely objected to it because I know
nothing about it' (TSN, pp. 346-347, Hearing of March 5, 1973, testimony of A. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> on Cross Examination).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the contrary, I find it more
logical to conclude that respondent became enmeshed in the unholy design
because of his personal relation with Ex-Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
who prodded him into action, as the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> growing
impatience in reaping the harvest of his nefarious scheme appear to have been
aggravated by the seeming reticence of the complainant in coming across with
the bribe money" (pp. 7-11, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The investigator's recommendation is that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> be found <u>guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best
interest of the service, and</u> that he be required to resign pursuant to
Letter of Instruction No. 14-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1973</st1:date>,
the Department of Justice forwarded the said report and recommendation to this
COURT.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no clear and convincing evidence that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> introduced and represented himself to complainant
Jesus Bernal, operator of the Department of Justice canteen, "as the
person sent by Fiscal Angel <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> to collect a sum
of money being extorted from Mr. Bernal in connection with his pending case in
Branch VII, Court of First Instance, Manila" or that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> "even urged Mr. Bernal to expedite the payment
of said money."</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Bernal on this point cannot be
accorded full faith and credit; because their testimony pictures respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, then Supply Officer of the Department of Justice and
now of this COURT, to be either stupid or lacking in caution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bernal spouses declared that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
approached Mrs. Bernal inside the Department of Justice canteen at about 10:00
o'clock in the morning and told her that he was sent by then Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> to collect from them P25,000.00; and that the
canteen then was crowded with officials and employees of the Department of
Justice who were having their usual <span class="SpellE">merienda</span> and some
were passing them while they (Bernal spouses and respondent) were conversing as
the aforesaid officials and employees were paying for their snacks or leaving
the cashier after paying their chits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. Bernal was then by the cash register.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is unthinkable that respondent, who is a responsible supply
officer and should therefore be credited with some degree of intelligence,
would be so imprudent or so stupid as to publicly advise the spouses that he
was the agent of former Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> to
collect the amount of P25,000.00, which the ex-Assistant Fiscal was extorting
from them in connection with a civil case in the Manila Court of First Instance
branch presided by the brother of said former Assistant Fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, from their own evidence (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
B and C), as well as from their testimony, their allegation is that the former
Assistant Fiscal appears to be his own collector and employed no intermediary
or agent to do the collection for him, except in the last instance when he
allegedly instructed respondent to show up and introduce himself to the <span class="SpellE">Bernals</span> as the "bag-man".</p>

<p class="BODY">Under oath, Mr. Bernal declared in Exhibits B and C, and upon
cross-examination on March 5, 1973 (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 39-40),
that the pick-up date by that "somebody from the Department of
Justice" was "Friday, 26 January 1973" and not on January
30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified also on
cross-examination that on the afternoon of January 29, 1973, "the final
instruction" of the then Assistant City Fiscal on the delivery of the
"extortion" money was that Mr. Bernal himself should deliver the
payola <u>to him</u> (fiscal) in his office at the Manila City Hall, on January
31, 1973, and not on January 30, 1973 (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p.
52).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, Mr. Bernal admitted that on
January 26, 1973 when that "somebody" would introduce himself to pick
up the money, the person who showed up was the then Assistant City Fiscal
himself at the Department of Justice canteen (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
pp. 50, 55, 56-57, 58, 117).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Mrs.
Bernal testified that it was the former Assistant City Fiscal who showed up on
that date at the department canteen looking for her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told him that her husband was out of town
which angered the fiscal (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 55).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Mr. Bernal admitted this, plus the fact
that the former Assistant City Fiscal "even told my wife, I think Friday,
'if your husband will not arrive on Wednesday, you can forget everything’"
(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 50).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibit C also confirmed the fact that it was the then Assistant City
Fiscal again who showed up at the department canteen on <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was also angry, he scolded the employees therein and even pointed his
finger at Mrs. Bernal's face.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the start, no such intermediary came into the picture
between Mr. Bernal and the then Assistant Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Bernal admitted that it was Assistant
City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>,
Jr. of Manila, who introduced him to the former Assistant Fiscal on January 3,
1973 (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 31, 35); that he saw the former
Assistant Fiscal sometime before January 26, 1973 when the latter went to the
Department of Justice canteen (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 37); that
prior to January 26, the former Assistant Fiscal went to the Department of
Justice canteen "every now and then"; and that "[t]here was one
time when he told me (Mr. Bernal) to go to the Swiss Inn Restaurant one lunch
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then the rest mostly in the
canteen and also in his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told
me 'you go to my office, I will talk to you.' And then one time he told me to
go to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Cultural</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>"
(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 38), and they did meet there on the
afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Bernal also declared that he used to
visit the then Assistant Fiscal in his office at the City Hall before <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
p. 38).</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Bernal's testimony is quite revealing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His contacts with the former Assistant Fiscal
from <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1973</st1:date>, were
close, direct and personal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
intermediary was spoken of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, more
significantly, nowhere did respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>' name or
shadow come into the scene.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Bernal declared that he and the former Assistant Fiscal
agreed that the money will be collected through an intermediary on <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this' is easier said than believed; it is
too loose for comfort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For there were
vital questions left unanswered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>who</u>
is the supposed collector or intermediary?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Where</u>, <u>how</u> and at <u>what</u> time should the unnamed
collector or intermediary collect the money?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, on that day of <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="1">January
 26, 1973</st1:date>, it was the former Assistant Fiscal who showed up at the
Department of Justice canteen looking for Mr. Bernal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, on January 28th, no
"intermediary" showed up at the canteen (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
p. 57).</p>

<p class="BODY">From all indications, if Bernal is to be believed, the then
Assistant Fiscal seemed to be his own collector and appeared to have all the
ways, means and opportunities to collect the P25,000.00 from the complainant
and his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1973</st1:date>, the former Fiscal appeared to be
in all places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw Mr. Bernal many
times at his (<span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>) office; "every now and
then" he showed up at the Department of Justice canteen, at the
"Swiss Inn Restaurant", at the "<st1:place><st1:placename>Cultural</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>", in "<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>",
and even in the "clinic" of the former <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
sister.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE have read and reread the report and WE found that the
investigator of the Department of Justice completely avoided discussing why Mr.
Bernal did not implicate respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> in his
first sworn statement before the National Bureau of Investigation on January
29, 1973, when on that date, as the complainant claimed, he had already seen
respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and the then Assistant Fiscal
together in the latter's Mercedes Benz car within the Department of Justice
compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even after Mr. Bernal executed
his second sworn statement on <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1973</st1:date>, the National Bureau of Investigation stood firm in its
report to the Department of Justice that it is "<u>not in a position to
recommend that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> likewise be charged
administratively</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The, department investigator pointed out that there was “absence
of any motive" on the part of the complaining witness and his wife
"to perjure themselves"; and that "it (is) preposterous to
assume that complainant would impute derogatory remarks to one whom they did
not know or meet before the incident at bar." Apart from the fact, which
cannot be discounted, that at heart, the husband and wife who teamed together
seek to establish their serious complaint of "extortion" at all costs
to obtain a favorable outcome, there is a good motive why they would implicate
the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record
is firm and <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> that, as respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> declared, Sgt. Morales of the Department Operation
Warrant of Arrest, requested respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, upon
complainant's own prodding, to testify against the former Assistant
Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he begged to be excused, for
he "knows nothing about it."</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigator found "it more logical that respondent
became enmeshed in the unholy design because of his personal relation with
Ex-Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> who prodded him into action x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." due to the ex-<span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> "growing impatience ….. aggravated by the
seeming reluctance of the complainant in coming across with the bribe
money." But the report miserably failed to exert and amplify as well as
cement with positive and unequivocal assurances and details what appeared to be
a casual and loose reference to respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>'
supposed complicity in the extortion scheme, or what special power and
influence respondent had over the complainant Bernal as would break down his
"seeming reticence" and make him come across with the supposed
pay-off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the report speaks of
"personal relation", the only link that was pointed out is that
respondent is a "<span class="SpellE">townmate</span>" of the former
Assistant City Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this alone is
too tenuous to prove closeness of personal relationship or association between
them when conspiracy implies con­cert of design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence proves nothing whatsoever of any
previous or even coetaneous understanding or common cause or negotiations to
weld respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> with then Assistant City Fiscal
<span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
any event, it would be dangerous to hold that "unholy design" was
proved simply because respondent <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> was seen with
the former Assistant City Fiscal in the latter's car on <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1973</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 p.m.</st1:time> at the Department of Justice compound.</p>

receipt of this complaint, Undersecretary of Justice <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>
called upon the Regional Director, HORO, NBI for a conference in his

Undersecretary, went to the NBI and executed a sworn statement dated <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A, pp. 54-56, rec.) narrating the following incidents:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometime in 1971, Jaime Bernal
filed a civil suit against the NAWASA, now the Metropolitan Waterworks and
Sewerage System, for collection of the sum of P223,000 representing the
latter's obligation for janitorial services rendered by Bernal's men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was assigned in the Court of First
Instance Branch of Manila presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
December 21 or 22, 1972, the case was submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometime in the first week of
January, 1973, while Jaime Bernal was waiting for Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> of Manila in connection with the hearing of a
certain <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case filed by said Jaime Bernal
against one of his employees, Assistant Fiscal Angel <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>,
brother of Judge <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>, arrived.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
introduced Bernal to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>, who commented
that he used to see him in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of his brother,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernal replied that he has a pending case
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
then inquired whether Bernal needed any help and the latter answered that he
needed all the help he could get.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Bernal, upon being asked by the Fiscal where they could see each other,
designated the canteen in the Department of Justice being operated by his wife.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Several days later, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> arrived at the canteen and informed Bernal that
his case "is not very good".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was surprised and told the Fiscal that the NAWASA failed to dispute
his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> proposed that he could help Bernal if the latter
could give him a sub­stantial amount from the amount to be awarded to
Bernal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernal replied that he would pay
if he could afford and after the decision shall have become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
promised to return as soon as the decision has been prepared.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Subsequently, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> returned to the canteen and on January 23 or 24,
1973 (Tuesday or Wednesday), instructed Bernal to be ready with the amount of
P25,000 by Friday (<st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernal said he has to go to the province to
raise the money and added that he must see the decision first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to the province but failed to raise
the necessary amount.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On Friday (January 26), Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> went to the canteen and talked to Mrs. Bernal,
instructing her to prepare the money by Sunday (January 28), otherwise she
should forget the whole thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Fiscal further instructed her to call him at <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00
 p.m.</st1:time> on Sunday at the house of Judge <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>;
and gave her the telephone number.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Bernal was not able to call up
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00
 p.m.</st1:time> that day because he "tried to raise the money".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called up at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 p.m.</st1:time> and a woman answered, saying that the Fiscal was not there any­more;
but left instruction to call him up at his office on Monday morning (January
29).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before Bernal could make the
call, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> went to the canteen and
instructed one of the employees to inform Mrs. Bernal to see him at his
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, before Mrs. Bernal
could leave, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> returned to the canteen
and told her to be ready with the money by Wednesday (January 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before lunch that day, the Fiscal went to the
canteen and told Mrs. Bernal that the decision will be withheld only until
Wednesday (January 31).</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Jaime Bernal consulted his friends
who accompanied him to the office of Undersecretary of Justice <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> in the
afternoon of that day, Monday (January 29).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Undersecretary advised him to go to the NBI.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">After giving his sworn statement to
the NBI, Bernal was advised to fulfill his engagement with Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Cultural</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Two NBI agents and a photographer
were immediately dispatched to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Cultural</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> and they saw Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> and Bernal talking to each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the Fiscal left, followed by Bernal in
his own car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NBI agents followed but
lost them at <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On February 1 (Thursday), Bernal
returned to the NBI and in his executed second sworn statement dated <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B, pp. 56-59, rec.), narrated that from the Cultural Center, they proceeded to
the clinic of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima's</span> sister somewhere in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, and in a doctor's room, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> let Bernal read a carbon copy of the decision
(bearing initials) in the civil case aforementioned, and instructed him
"to be on time the coming Wednesday when he will give the instructions on
how to deliver the money."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Bernal also stated in his sworn
statement that at around 10:00 a.m. on January 30 (Tuesday), the day following
his meeting with Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> at the Cultural
Center, respondent went to the canteen, and introduced himself to Mrs. Bernal
and told her that he was sent by Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> to
inform her that he and his brother Judge <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>, "were disappointed with what happened during
the previous Friday" as the pay-off did not materialize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Bernal approached his wife, she introduced
him to respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent told
Bernal that he was the man whom Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
assigned to collect the money the previous Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Bernal, respondent was also the
same fellow who was inside the car of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
and later disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This incident was
seen by Bernal's friends after they came from the office of Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> in the
afternoon of January 29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent also
told Bernal that Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> informed him
(respondent) about their meeting at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Cultural</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Bernal left respondent while he
was eating.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1973</st1:date>, Jaime Bernal executed a third sworn
statement before the <st1:place><st1:placename>Operation</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Dept. of Justice (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "C" pp. 60-63, rec.)
as supplement to his sworn statements dated January 29 and February 1 taken
before the NBI.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I wish only to stress that the sworn statements and testimony of
the complainant Jaime Bernal and such other evidence as he may have presented
at the investigation of his complaint against respondent <span class="SpellE">Antoliano</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> which cast aspersions against former Assistant
City Fiscal Angel P. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> of Manila and which are
extensively discussed in the decision can in no way be taken against the former
fiscal since they were all made ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elementary due process demands this
for the former fiscal has neither been heard nor charged nor given the
opportunity to confront his detractor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has disbelieved the <span class="SpellE">Bernals</span>'
grave charge and testimony against respondent's accusing him of being a party
to the alleged extortion scheme of the former fiscal as they would picture
respondent "to be either stupid or lacking in caution." (See page
11).</p>

<p class="BODY">It may only be noted that applying the same yardstick, the <span class="SpellE">Bernals</span>' ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> testimony
against the former fiscal would have to be disbelieved <u>per se</u> even
without hearing the latter's side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Bernal's sworn statement, the fiscal allegedly promised to help obtain a
favorable decision in Bernal's case against NWSA provided Bernal paid the
fiscal the sum of P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernal replied that "he would pay <u>if</u>
he could afford and <u>after</u> the decision shall have become final."
Yet Bernal forgetting his own condition of finality of the decision allegedly
"went to the province but failed to raise the necessary amount." <span class="GramE">(See p. 3, decision).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To use the investigator's own observation (although made in another
context) "Certainly, complainant (Bernal) would have realized that
whatever advantage he can obtain in the lower court can still be obliterated by
an unfavorable appellate judgment" and such claim of complainant as to the
alleged extortion and the demand for <u>immediate</u> payment thereof
notwithstanding that complainant had imposed as condition for payment <u>if</u>
he could afford and <u>after</u> the decision shall have become final “would
have deserved credence" if the advantage offered by the ex-fiscal
"were a compromise agreement that would be the object of the decision in
the civil case" which would preclude elevating the case on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See page 9, decision).</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the record discloses many more reasons for disbelieving
the <span class="SpellE">Bernals</span>' allegations as to the very existence of
the alleged extortion scheme, among which may be briefly mentioned the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">- The statement of February 14, 1973 (Exhibit 13) and testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span>, then
Judicial Superintendent of the Department of Justice that Bernal sought his
help with the Judge (the brother of former Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>)
in his collection case of P230,000.00 against the <span class="SpellE">Nawasa</span>
to which he replied that "I could not just talk to a Judge regarding a
case pending in his <span class="SpellE">Sala</span>" and that Bernal made the
same "improper, immoral, contemptuous" overture to Undersecretary of
Justice Macaraig, which the latter also rejected outright and that "All
that they (Bernal and his companion <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
Francisco, Jr.) wanted was the decision of P230,000.00 from the Judge;"</p>

<p class="BODY">This is supported by the affidavit of Assistant Fiscal of Manila <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>, Jr. (Exhibit
9) that he introduced Bernal to the former fiscal at Bernal's request if
"(he) knew somebody close to Judge <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>"
as Bernal wanted to "wind up his affairs including, among others, the
early termination of a pending civil case before Judge <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
of the Court of First Instance of Manila” and by the certificate of City Fiscal
of Manila Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span> that the former fiscal
informed him on January 31, 1973 that "he had made an agreement with the
police authorities to entrap in his office a person who was trying to bribe his
brother, Judge <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>,
through him and he asked my permission to use his office for the purpose which
I granted."</p>

<p class="BODY">- The patent lack of merit of complainant Bernal's case against
the <span class="SpellE">Nawasa</span> which appears to have been aptly described
as a "get-rich-quick scheme" where Bernal manifestly bloated his
claim against the <span class="SpellE">Nawasa</span> for 2 weeks unpaid
janitorial services (and 7-day job training) for 29 employees from the actual
amount of some P15,000.00 (which he was actually paid as per their stipulation
of facts P73,000.00 (which he falsely claimed to have actually paid/them) plus
some P157,000.00 for moral and exemplary damages and attorneys' fees; and</p>

<p class="BODY">- The very decision of February 12, 1973 handed down in the case,
where pursuant to the very stipulation of facts of the parties since Bernal's
actual claims had been previously paid and discharged, the only issue submitted
to the court for resolution was whether or not Bernal was entitled to collect
damages and attorney's fees, and such issue was convincingly resolved in the
negative against Bernal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Very grave imputations and charges against the integrity of
former Assistant Fiscal Angel P. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> and of his
brother incumbent Judge <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
of the Court of First Instance of Manila have been made ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
by complainant Bernal in the course of the investigation of his complaint
against respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let copies hereof
and of the decision be furnished them by the Clerk of Court for whatever action
they may deem appropriate in the premises in order to ferret out the truth.</p>
