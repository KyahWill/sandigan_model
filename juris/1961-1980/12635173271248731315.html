operators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order (No. 3), amongst

however, provincial buses and <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span>
"operating within a radius of 50 <span class="SpellE">kms</span>. from the
Manila City Hall and whose business is more on the Manila end than on the
provincial end are given fifteen percent to prevent a dislocation of their
business; provided that operators having less than five units are not permitted
to cross the boundary and shall operate exclusively on the provin­cial
end," This order also allocated the number of units each provincial bus
operator is allowed to operate within the City of Manila.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. On the main, nothing new there is in the present petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the validity of Ordinance 4986 and the
Com­missioner's Administrative Order No. 1, series of 1964, here challenged,
has separately passed judicial tests in two cases brought before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagman</u></span><u> vs. City of Manila</u>
(June 30, 1966), 17 SCRA 579, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lagman</span> was
an operator of PU auto trucks with fixed routes and regular terminals for the
transportation of passengers and freight on the <span class="SpellE">Bocaue</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>) <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) line via <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue,
Plaza <span class="SpellE">Goiti</span>, Sta. Cruz Bridge, Plaza Lawton, P.
Burgos, Taft Avenue, and Taft Avenue Exten­sion, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sought to prohibit the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
its officers and agents, from enforcing Ordinance 4986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His ground was that said ordinance was
unconstitutional, illegal, ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span> and null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged, amongst others, that
(1) "the power conferred upon respondent City of Manila, under said
Section 18(<span class="SpellE">hh</span>) of Republic Act No. 409, as amended,
does not include the right to enact an ordinance such as the one in question,
which has the effect of amending or modifying a certificate of public
convenience granted by the Public Service Commission, because any amendment or
modification of said certificate is solely vested by law in the latter
governmental agency, and only after notice and hearing (Sec. 16[m], Public
Service Act); but since this procedure was not adopted or followed by
respondents in enacting the disputed ordinance, the same is likewise illegal
and null and void"; (2) "the enforce­ment of said ordinance is
arbitrary, oppressive and unreason­able because the city streets from which he
had been prevented to operate his buses are the cream of his business";
and (3) "even assuming that Ordinance No. 4986 is valid, it is only the
Public Service Commission which can require compliance with its pro­visions
(Sec. 17(j), Public Service Act), but since its implemen­tation is without the
sanction or approval of the Commission, its enforcement is also unauthorized
and illegal." This Court, in a decision impressive because of its
unanimity, upheld the ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Speaking through Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"First, as correctly maintained by re­spondents, Republic Act
No. 409, as amended, otherwise known as the Revised Charter of the City of
Manila, is a special law and of later enactment than Commonwealth Act No. 548
and the Public Service Law (Commonwealth Act No. 146, as amended), so that even
if conflict exists between the provisions of the former act and the latter
acts, Republic Act No. 409 should prevail over both Commonwealth Acts Nos. 548
and 146.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Cassion</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Nacional</span>
Filipino, 89 Phil. 560, 561, this Court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'for with or without an express enactment it is a familiar rule of
statutory construction that to the extent of any necessary repugnancy bet­ween
a general and a special law or provision, the latter will control the former
without regard to the respective dates of passage.'</p>

<blockquote>It is to be noted that Commonwealth Act No.548 does not confer an <u>exclusive</u>
power or authority upon the Director of Public Works, subject to the approval
of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, to promulgate rules and
regulations relating to the use of and traffic on national roads or
streets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, section 18
(<span class="SpellE">hh</span>) of the Manila Charter is deemed enacted as an
exception to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 548.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second, the same situation holds true with respect to the provision
of the Public Service Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the
Public Service Commission is empowered, under its Sec­tion 16 (m), to amend,
modify or revoke certificates of public convenience after notice and hearing,
yet there is no provision, spe­cific or otherwise, which can be found in this
statute (Commonwealth Act No. 146) vesting power in the Public Service
Commission to superintend, regulate, or control the streets of respondent City or
suspend its power to license or prohibit the occupancy thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, this right or authority,
as hereinabove concluded, is conferred upon respondent City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power vested in the Public Service
Commission under Sec­tion 16 (m) is, therefore, subordinate to the authority
granted to respondent City, under said section 18 (<span class="SpellE">hh</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the powers conferred by law upon the Public Service Commission
were not designed to deny or supersede the regulatory power of local governments
over motor traffic, in the streets subject to their control, is made evident by
section 17 (j) of the Public Service Act (Com­monwealth Act No. 146) that
provides as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'SEC. 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Proceedings of
Commission with­out previous hearing</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- The Commission shall have power, without previous hearing, subject to
established limitations and exceptions, and saving provisions to the contrary:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">(j) To require any <u>public service to comply</u> with the laws of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and <u>with any</u> provincial resolution or <u>muni­cipal ordinance relating
thereto</u>, and <u>to con­form to the duties imposed upon it</u> thereby, or
by the provisions of its own charter, whether obtained under any general or
special law of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.'
(Italics supplied)</p>

<blockquote>The petitioner's contention that, under this section, the
respective ordinances of the City can only be enforced by the Commission alone
is obviously unsound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsection (j)
refers not only to ordinances but also to 'the laws of the Philippines', and it
is plainly absurd to assume that even laws relating to public ser­vices are to
remain a dead letter without the <span class="SpellE"><u>placet</u></span> of the
Commission; and the section makes no distinction whatever between enforcement
of laws and that of municipal ordinances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The very fact, furthermore, that the Com­mission is empowered, but
not required, to demand compliance with apposite laws and ordi­nances proves
that the Commission's powers are merely supplementary to those of state organs,
such as the police, upon which the enforcement of laws primarily rests.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Third, the implementation of the ordinance in question cannot be
validly assailed as arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the fact that there is no evidence
to substantiate this charge, it is not disputed that petitioner has not been
totally banned or prohibited from operating all his buses, he having been
allowed to operate two (2) 'shuttle' buses within the city limits."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second case for certiorari and prohibition, filed by the same
petitioner in the first case just mentioned, is entitled "<span class="SpellE">Lagman</span> vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>"
(December 24, 1968), 26 SCRA 442.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Put at

was there alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that
“the provisions of the bus ban had not been incorporated into his certificate
of public con­venience"; "to be applicable to a grantee of such
certificate subsequently to the issuance of the order establishing the ban,
there should be a decision, not merely by the Commissioner, but, also, by the
PSC, rendered after due notice and hearing, based upon material changes in the
facts and circumstances under which the certificate had been granted"; and
"the ban is unfair, unreasonable and oppressive." We dismissed this
peti­tion and upheld the validity of the questioned order of the Com­missioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>

draw our attention to points which are not specifically ruled upon in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagman</u></span> cases heretofore mentioned.</p>

destroys vested rights of petitioning public services to operate inside Manila

correctly expresses the view that when the "right to enjoyment, present or

we put forth the thought that a vested right is "some right or interest in
the prop­erty which has become fixed and established, and is no longer open to
doubt or controversy"; it is an "immediate fixed right of present and
future enjoyment"; it is to be contradistinguished from a right that is
"expectant or contingent." The <span class="SpellE"><u>Benguet</u></span>
case also quoted from 16 C.J.S., Sec. 215, pp. 642-643, as follows: "Rights
are vested when the right to enjoyment, present or prospective, has become the
property of some particular person or persons as a present interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right must be absolute, complete, and
unconditional, independent of a contingency, and a mere expec­tancy of future
benefit, or a contingent interest in property founded on anticipated
continuance of existing laws, does not constitute a vested right, So, inchoate
rights which have not been acted on are not vested."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, whether a right is vested or not, much depends upon

<p class="BODY">Contending that they possess valid and subsisting certi­ficates
of public convenience, the petitioning public services aver that they acquired
a vested right to operate their public utility vehicles to and from Manila as
appearing in their said respective certificates of public convenience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners’ argument pales on the face of the fact that the very
nature of a certificate of public convenience is at cross pur­poses with the
concept of vested rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day,
the accepted view, at least insofar as the State is concerned, is that "a
certi­ficate of public convenience constitutes neither a franchise nor a
contract, confers no property right, and is a mere license or pri­vilege."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The holder of such certificate does not acquire a property right in the route
covered thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does it confer upon
the holder any proprietary right or interest or franchise in the public
highways.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Revocation of this certificate deprives him of no vested right.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Little reflection is necessary to show that the certificate of public
convenience is granted with so many strings attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New and additional burdens, alteration of the
certificate, and even revocation or annulment thereof is reserved to the State.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need but add that the Public Service Commission, a government
agency vested by law with "jurisdiction, supervision, and control over all
public services and their franchises, equip­ment, and other properties"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
is empowered, upon proper notice and hearing, amongst others: (1) "[t]o
amend, modify or revoke at any time a certificate issued under the provisions
of this Act [Commonwealth Act 146, as amended], whenever the facts and
circumstances on the strength of which said certificate was issued have been
misrepresented or materially changed";<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) "[t]o suspend or revoke any certificate issued under the

order, rule or regulation of the Commission or any provision of this Act: Pro­vided,
That the Commission, for good cause, may prior to the hearing suspend for a
period not to exceed thirty days any certi­ficate or the exercise of any right
or authority issued or granted under this Act by order of the Commission,
whenever such step shall in the judgment of the Commission be necessary to
avoid serious and irreparable damage or inconvenience to the public or to
private interests."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Jurisprudence echoes the rule that the Commission is authorized to make
reasonable rules and regu­lations for the operation of public services and to
enforce them.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In reality, all certificates of public convenience issued are subject to the
condition that all public services "shall observe and comply [with] x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> all the rules and regulations
of the Commission relative to" the service.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
To further emphasize the control imposed on public services, before any public
service can "adopt, maintain, or apply practices or measures, rules, or
regulations to which the public shall be subject in its relation with the
public service", the Commission's approval must first be had.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public services
must also reckon with pro­vincial resolutions and municipal ordinances relating
to the operation of public utilities within the province or municipality
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission can require
compliance with these provincial resolutions or municipal ordinances.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Illustrative of the lack of "absolute, complete, and uncon­ditional"
right on the part of public services to operate because of the delimitations
and restrictions which circumscribe the pri­vilege afforded a certificate of
public convenience is the following from the early (March 31, 1915) decision of
this Court in <u>Fisher vs. <span class="SpellE">Yangco</span> Steamship <span class="SpellE">Comaany</span></u>, 31 Phil. 1, 18-19:</p>

well settled that the power of the state to exercise legislative control over
railroad companies and other carriers 'in all respects necessary to pro­tect

boards of commis­sioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(New York etc.

<p class="BODY">The foregoing, without more, rejects the vested rights theory
espoused by petitioning bus operators.</p>

<p class="BODY">Very little need be added to show that neither do bus passengers
have a vested right to be transported directly into the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would suffice if a statement be here made
that the alleged right of bus passengers, to a great extent, is dependent upon
the manner public services are allowed to operate within a given area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, regulations imposed upon public
services directly affect the bus passengers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is quite obvious that if buses were allowed to load or unload solely
at specific or designated places, a passenger cannot legally demand or insist
that the operator load or unload him at a place other than those specified or
designated.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is no argument to support the vested rights theory that petitioning
passengers have enjoyed the privilege of having been continuously transported
even before the outbreak of the war directly without transfer from the
provinces to places inside <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
up to the respective bus terminals in said City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Times have changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vehicles have increased in number.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Traffic congestion has moved from bad to

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is because of all of
these that it has become neces­sary for the police power of the State to step
in, not for the benefit of the few, but for the benefit of the many.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasonable restrictions have to be provided
for the use of the thorough­fares.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

So it is, that by the exercise of the police power, which is a continuing one,
"a business lawful today may in the future, because of the changed

As a corollary, measures calculated to promote the safety and convenience of

has grown to alarming and emergency proportions, and in the best interest of public
welfare and convenience, the following traffic rules and regulations are hereby
