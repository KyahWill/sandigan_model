				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">There is no difficulty attendant to the disposition of this automatic review of a death sentence imposed by the late Judge Manases G. Reyes on the accused Rodolfo Andaya.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> To state the decisive issue is to make plain what the outcome would be. The grievance, a legitimate one at that, alleged by Andaya was that his conviction was made to rest on a plea of guilty made to a court not sufficiently alert to the need for the utmost care to be taken before the life of the person on the dock could be declared forfeit. There is an exigent need that the accused in admitting the commission of the offense charged does so of his own free will. Moreover, to make a reality of the constitutional presumption of innocence, the reception of evidence to support the allegations of the information and the aggravating circumstances is indicated more often than not. So we have stressed, especially lately from People v. Apduhan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Such a duty is incumbent on every lower court. It is true such a decision was promulgated about seven months later than the sentence now under review. Nonetheless, the Apduhan doctrine is traceable to a 1907 decision by Justice Carson in United States v. Rota<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and followed subsequently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Deference to such a doctrine that has been so constantly reiterated, one such decision having been rendered only the other day<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> penned by Justice Castro, who was likewise the ponente in Apduhan leaves us no choice but to set aside the conviction of the accused and remand the case for a new trial.<br><br>How the proceedings were conducted in the lower court was set forth in the able brief of counsel <i>de oficio,</i> Jose W. Diokno. The offense for which the accused was indicted is murder, allegedly attended by the aggravating circumstances of recidivism and its commission at nighttime, as well as intoxication. After stating that there is no dispute as to the plea of guilty upon his being arraigned having been made, it continued: "But as to whether or not the accused Rodolfo Andaya was properly advised of the consequences of his plea, the records of the case do not thus show. Though, in the decision, the trial court has declared that, 'the Court propounded questions as to whether the accused fully understands the consequences of his plea', the transcript of stenographic notes do not bear this out. In such event, we believe, as to whether the accused Rodolfo Andaya was properly apprised of the consequences of his plea, the same should be resolved in his favor-that is, that he was not properly informed of the consequences."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On the above facts and relying on People v. Sabilul,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and People v. Bulalake,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> it asked that the conviction be set aside and the case remanded for a new trial. All that the eight-page brief for the prosecution could allege after five petitions for extension sought and granted, dating from June 13, 1969 to October 9, 1969, was that there was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the law, no reference at all being made to the trend quite noticeable as to the compelling force of Apduhan.<br><br>There is, to repeat, no predictable result to our automatic review except to grant the prayer that the case be remanded for a new trial. Apduhan and the twenty-one cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> thereafter decided in accordance with its categorical requirement that there be due observance of the fundamental requirements of due process before a plea of guilty is accorded acceptance speak too plainly for the message to be misread. We pay due heed to what they say.<br><br>There is moreover this excerpt from People v. Espiña<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> that possesses relevance: "This Court has never been remiss in its oversight of the mode and manner in which lower courts discharge their judicial function, especially so in cases of this character. * * * The recognition of the discretion possessed by the trial court to determine whether or not a plea of guilty has been improvidently made notwithstanding, it has been the constant concern of this Tribunal to require the most meticulous care on its part. This is to avoid a life being forfeited even if there be circumstances that would militate against such a conclusion. It is highly desirable that evidence be taken to erase any doubt as to the degree of culpability of the accused before a death sentence is imposed. Considering all the awesome consequences that is entailed, such degree of circumspection is a must. To such an approach, both defense and the prosecution remain, as they should be, committed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The Espiña decision likewise stressed why such an approach is demanded by the due process guarantee. Thus: "It is not to be lost sight of that insofar as an accused person is concerned, this all-embracing requirement of fairness found in the first paragraph of Section 1 of the Bill of Rights, is made even more categorical in paragraph 15 thereof, which unmistakable language precludes his being 'held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law.' This clause was explained by the then Delegate Laurel in his sponsorship address on the provision on the Bill of Rights as an embodiment of the doctrine in Ong Chang Wing v. United States. What is immediately apparent is that the procedural aspect of due process insofar as an accused is concerned by this specific constitutional guarantee is further emphasized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Further from the same opinion: "It only remains to be added that as of [the time when the 1935] Constitution was drafted, it was already a settled principle of law that where a plea of guilty is entered in a case that may result in the imposition of the death penalty, it must be 'made under the conditions indicated, that is to say on arraignment, freely and voluntarily, as an express admission of the guilt of the accused of the offense with which he is charged, and with full knowledge of the conse­quences and the meaning of his act.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the lower court of February 7, 1968 finding the accused guilty of murder and sentencing him to death is hereby set aside and the case remanded to such court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
