Gasendo to amend his complaint from Homicide to Murder."<br><br>Hence, the present recourse:&nbsp; a special civil action for certiorari and <i>mandamus </i>filed on June 14, 1973 by the petitioner, questioning the applicability in the case at bar of the rule laid down in Bandiala.<br><br>We hold that Bandiala is <i>inapropos</i> in the case before us.<br><br>In <i>Bandiala</i> the municipal judge, with whom the complaint for "robbery in band" against Bandiala was filed, upon determination of the existence of a probable cause after preliminary investigation, remanded the case to the court of first instance for trial on the merits.&nbsp; However, the fiscal filed instead, without a new preliminary investigation, an information for "robbery with kidnapping." The fiscal had denied Bandiala's request for a copy of an alleged written confession of Bandiala upon which the inclusion of the offense of "kidnapping" in the questioned information was apparently based.<br><br>This evidence was withheld by the fiscal at the preliminary investigation conducted by the municipal court, only to uncover and reveal it later for the purpose of raising the category of the offense to be charged by him in the information.&nbsp; In condemning this action of the fiscal, we pointedly expressed the reminder that "the role of a fiscal is not mainly to prosecute, but essentially to do justice to every man and to assist the courts in dispensing that justice." Trite to add, the facts in Bandiala are a world disparate from those obtaining in the case at bar.<br><br>In this case before us, when Sgt. Gasendo filed his complaint in the court a quo, no preliminary investigation had as yet been had thereon, and none was ever conducted by the respondent judge who, instead, directed the office of the provincial fiscal to conduct one.&nbsp; It is not disputed that the inquest fiscal faithfully complied with the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 77, supra, governing preliminary investigation of cases filed with the fiscal's office.<br><br>Moreover, a close scrutiny of all the exhibits adduced before the inquest fiscal completely satisfies this Court that the explicit allegations in the information of qualifying and aggravating circumstances, namely, treachery, cruelty, taking advantage of public position, employment of means to weaken the defense, and abuse of superior strength, find ample basis in the positive declarations contained in the affidavits of the witnesses listed in the complaint.&nbsp; Consequently, the fiscal cannot be faulted for arriving at the opinion that an information for murder, and not merely for homicide, should be filed against the private respondents.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order of the respondent judge dated May 2, 1973 in criminal case 652 is annulled and set aside.&nbsp; The respondent judge is hereby ordered to set the said criminal case forthwith for arraignment and trial in accordance with law.&nbsp; Costs de oficio.<br><br><i>Makalintal, C.J., Makasiar, Esguerra,</i> and <i>Muñoz Palma, JJ., </i>concur.<br><i>Teehankee, J.,</i> in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The said Circular reads,<i> inter alia</i>:<br><blockquote>"Quoted hereunder is Presidential Decree No. 77 dated December 6, 1972 amending Section 1 of Republic Act No. 5180 prescribing a uniform system of preliminary investigation:<br><br>‘1.
