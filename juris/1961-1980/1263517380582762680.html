				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from a resolution of the Court of First
Instance of Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> dismissing the
complaint <span style="">in its </span>Civil Case No.
139.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 5, 1962 the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the court
below against the defendants, alleging <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">alia</span></u></span><span style="">:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>that sometime <span style="">in </span>1954 and 1958 the plaintiffs discovered,
staked, located and registered several mining claims in barrio <span class="SpellE">Nagsabungan</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Ilog</span>, <span style="">province
</span>of Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>; that sometime in 1958
the defendant corporation, thru <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Feliciano, allegedly staked, located and registered
mining claims denominated as Hercules 1 to 24 and <span class="SpellE">Feli</span>
1 to 23 over the same plat of ground covered by the plaintiffs' claims; that
the defendant corporation was not yet legally <span style="">in existence </span>when its claims were
located by its supposed agents; that since the mining claims of the plaintiffs
were <span style="">discovered,
</span>staked, located and registered much ahead of the defendant corporation's
claims, the plaintiffs had the priority to lease the areas covered by their
mineral claims; that the lode claims known as <span class="SpellE">Rully</span> 1
and 2 of plaintiffs Pedro <span style="">C. </span><span class="SpellE">Tiangco</span> and Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Guese</span> had
already been surveyed for lease purposes, while other claims were covered by
correspond­ing lease applications and under the plaintiffs' possession; <span style="">that on September 23, 1959 the </span><span style="">defendant
corporation filed </span>with the Director of Mines a protest, docketed as M<span style="">ines </span>Ad­ministrative
Case No. V-272, against the lease survey of the lode claims <span class="SpellE">Rully</span>
1 and 2 of plaintiffs Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Tiangco</span> and Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Guese</span> on the ground that said claims <span style="">overlapped its </span>mining
claims Hercules 5 and 6 and <span class="SpellE">Feli</span> 2,3,5, and 6, while
on September 29, 1959 the plaintiffs intervened in Mines Ad­ministrative Case
No. V-273 (protest filed against the defendant corporation by Consolidated
Mines, Inc.) and pro­tested against the lease survey of the lode claims
Hercules 4, 5, 6, 22 and 24 and <span class="SpellE">Feli</span> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, and 18 of the defendant corporation on the ground that said claims over­lapped
the bigger portion of the area covered by the mining claims of the plaintiffs;
that the aforementioned cases were jointly heard by the Investigating Officer
of the Bureau of Mines and thereafter a decision was rendered declaring the
mining claims of the plaintiffs null and void; that the de­cision of the
Director of Mines was appealed to and affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources; that the aforementioned decision was rendered after a
half-hazard and biased trial; and that it was not supported by competent
evidence and not in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiffs, therefore, prayed that the mineral claims of the
defendant corporation be declared null and void; that the lease contract of the
defendant corporation, if any, be cancelled or its lease application denied;
and that the Director of Mines and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
be ordered to give due course to the lease application of the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="2"><span style="">February
 8, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the <span class="GramE">defendants</span> Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
and the Director of Mines moved jointly to dismiss the complaint on the ground
that it was filed outside the period of thirty (30) days provided in Section 61
of Commonwealth Act No. 137, as amended by </span>Republic Act No. 746.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant corporation filed its answer to
the complaint, invoking the same ground as a special defense and submitting it
for preliminary hearing and consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finding the ground relied upon by the defendants to be <span class="GramE">meritorious,</span> the lower court dismissed <span style="">the </span>complaint in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs moved to reconsider, and upon denial of their motion
interposed this appeal, alleging that the lower court committed the following
errors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in not conducting a hearing
on the merits of the case which <span style="">is </span>to quiet title on mining claims; (2) in
practically withdrawing controversies in mining from the general jurisdiction
of the courts; (3) in holding that the decision of the Director of Mines, as
affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, was already
final in accordance with the Mining Act; (4) <span style="">in </span>holding that Section 61 of Commonwealth
Act No. 137 as amended by Republic Act No. 746 <span style="">is </span>mandatory, not directory; and (5)
in dismissing the complaint, and denying the motion for reconsideration filed
in due time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants contend that since the action is one to quiet
title concerning mining claims, the lower court should have conducted a hearing
on the merits in order to settle the conflicts between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention <span style="">is </span>clearly without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegations in the complaint
unequivocally show that the action was by way of appeal from the decision of
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources under the provision of
Section 61 of Commonwealth Act No. 137, as amended by Republic Act No. 746,
which states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 61.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conflicts and disputes arising out of mining
locations shall be submitted to the Director of Mines for decision; Provided, <span class="GramE">That</span> the decision or order of the Director of Mines may be
appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources within thirty
days from the date of its receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
case any one of the parties should disagree from the decision or order of the
Director of Mines or of the Secretary of Agricul­ture and Natural Resources,
the matter may be taken to the court of competent jurisdiction within thirty
days from the receipt of such decision or order; other­wise the said decision
or order shall be final and binding upon the parties concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above-quoted
provision is clear and explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an
earlier case involving its application this Court said:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It would appear from the above that in case one of the
parties should disagree from the decision or order of the Director of Mines or
of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources over a conflict or
dispute which arises out of a mining location the matter may be taken to the court
of competent jurisdiction within 30 days from receipt of such order or
decision, otherwise the same shall become final and binding upon the parties
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here there is no dispute that
the required period of 30 days had already lapsed when appellant actually
instituted the present action, and such being the case it would appear that the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> was correct in ruling that the action of appellants
is already lost and the case should be dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the instant case the
lower court found that the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources was received by counsel for the appellants on September 1, 1961; that
on September </span>29, <span style="">1961, or after </span>the
lapse of 28 days, the appellants filed a motion for reconsideration, which was
denied on November 28, 1961; that on December <span style="">8, </span>1961 the appellants' counsel received the order denying the
motion for reconsideration; and that the complaint was filed in court on
January 5, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not counting the period
of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the motion for reconsideration,
fifty-six (56) days passed from the receipt <span style="">of the decision up to the filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision had indeed <span class="GramE">became</span>
final.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellants contend,
however, that the action </span>was within the original, not appellate,
jurisdiction of the court under Section 73 of the Mining Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This section provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 73.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any time during the period of application,
any adverse claim may be filed under oath with the Director of Mines, and shall
state in full detail the nature, boundaries, and extent of the adverse claim,
and shall be accompanied by all plans, documents, and agreements upon which
such adverse claim is based:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided,
however, </u><u><span style="">That no adverse claim from any person association, partnership or
corporation, whose protest </span></u><u><span style="">filed
under section sixty-one of this Act has already been finally decided by the
Director </span></u><u><span style="">of Mines <span style="">and</span>/or the Secretary </span>of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, shall be entertained</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of any adverse claim all
proceedings except the publication of notice of application for lease and the
making and filing of the affidavit in connection therewith, as herein
prescribed, shall be stayed until the controversy shall have been settled or
decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, or the adverse claim waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the duty of the adverse claimant,
<span style="">within thirty </span>days after filing
his claim, to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to
determine the controversy and to prosecute the same with reasonable diligence
to final judgment, and a failure to do so shall be considered as a waiver of
his adverse claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" </span>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
is obvious that the foregoing provision does not govern this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">contemplates a situation where no conflict or dispute concerning mining
locations has been submitted to and decided administratively under Section
61.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there <span style="">is </span>such a conflict and a decision <span style="">is rendered by </span>the Director of Mines and/or the Secretary of
Agriculture <span style="">and Natural Resources, </span>then
the only recourse of the <span style="">losing </span>party
<span style="">is </span>to appeal to the court, and
the appeal must <span style="">be taken </span>within
the peremptory period of thirty (30) <span style="">days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No </span></span><span style="">adverse </span><span style="">claim under Section 73 shall be entertained
once the adminis</span><span style="">trative decision
rendered under Section 61 has <span style="">become
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise there would, be <span class="SpellE">multiciplicity</span> of suits involving </span></span>the same
parties, subject matter and cause of action, wherein conceivably there may be
conflicting decisions, both of them final - one administrative and the other <span style="">judicial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the resolution appealed from <span style="">is </span>hereby
affirmed, with costs against the appellants.</p>
