				<H3>ESTANISLAO ABAGA, ALEJANDRO COSTA, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. HON. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, FIRST REGIONAL DISTRICT, LINGAYEN, PANGASINAN, RENE LICHAUCO, AMANDA VDA. DE LA CRUZ, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In six cases filed in the Court of Agrarian Relations, herein respondent 
Lichaucos, owners of the hacienda El Porvenir in Pangasinan, sued their tenants 
for ejectment and collection of unpaid rentals (CAR Nos. 115, 116, 117, 118, 120 
and 165). Among those tenants are the present petitioners. The Land Tenure 
Administration intervened on the ground that the hacienda El Porvenir was the 
subject of a complaint for expropriation it had instituted and which was then 
pending in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan (Sp. Civil Action No. 
T-434), and that consequently respondent Court of Agrarian Relations had no 
jurisdiction to entertain the ejectment cases against the tenants in view of 
section 20 of Republic Act No. 1400<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 20.—<i>Prohibition Against Alienation</i>.—Upon the filing of the 
petition referred to in sections 12 and 16, the landowner cannot alienate any 
portion of the land covered by such petition except in irarsuance of the 
provisions of this Act; or enter into any form of contract to defeat the 
purposes of this Act, and no ejectment proceedings against any tenant or 
occupant of the land covered by the petition shall be instituted; or prosecuted 
until it becomes certain that the land shall not be acquired by the 
Administration."</p></blockquote>
<p>The expropriation proceeding, however, was partially settled when the parties 
therein filed a joint motion in which they presented an agreement for the sale, 
at prices to be fixed by this Court, of certain portions the hacienda, excluding 
other portions which were to be retained by the Lichaucos. As to the portions 
thus excluded the expropriation proceeding was accordingly dismissed.</p>
<p>On March 29, 1962 respondent Judge Pastor L. de Guzman of the Court of 
Agrarian Relations rendered his decision, ordering that the respondents there 
(among them petitioners herein) who "have not shown to the satisfaction of the 
court that their failure to pay their rentals as found in the part of the 
decision (sic) was caused by the fortuitous events and circumstances beyond 
their control justifying their failure to complete the payment of their 
respective rentals are all hereby ordered ejected from their respective 
landholdings described in the petition except the respondents-tenants whose 
landholdings are within the area of the portion of the hacienda purchased by the 
government, through the Land Tenure Administration, which landholdings were 
segregated on account of the agreement of the landholders and the government, 
the case of ejectment against them is dismissed, but they are all ordered to pay 
their landholders (this should be landowners) their full rentals as found by the 
court."</p>
<p>A copy of the decisioix was. received by petitioners on April 12, 1962. They 
filed a notice of appeal on April 24, but moved to withdraw the same on April 
26, stating that they wished to file a motion for reconsideration, for which 
they asked for an extension of 10 days. The withdrawal was granted and on May 4, 
1962, within the extended period, they filed the motion for reconsideration, 
which was denied for lack of merit on the following June 25. Petitioner received 
a copy of the order of denial on July 5, 1962, two days before the expiration of 
the period within which to appeal.</p>
<p>Instead of appealing, however, petitioners, filed before os this special 
civil action for certiorari. The petition contains only bare and summary 
references, in chronological order, to the different pleadings and other 
incidents in the court below in the six cases aforementioned, including the 
decision and the order denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration. The 
texts of said proceedings are annexed to the petition, but there is no 
allegation that respondent Judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or 
with grave abuse of discretion. Much less does the petition allege any errors 
committed by respondent Judge which would constitute such lack or express of 
jurisdiction, or grave abuse of discretion. All it alleges, after the summary 
statement of the proceedings in the lower court, is that there is no appeal, nor 
any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law except the 
petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>The procedure to obtain a review of a decision of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations is that provided in Rule 44, which 4&amp; made available for that 
purpose by our resolution of January 5, 1956. This Rule says in section 1: "An 
appeal by certiorari from an award, order or decision (of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations) shall be perfected by filing with said Court a notice of appeal and 
with the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari against the adverse party 
within ten (10) days from notice of the award, order or decision appealed from 
"; and in section 2: "the petition shall contain a summary statement of the 
issues involved and the reasons relied on for the allowance of the writ . . . 
Only questions of law, which must be <i>distinctly set forth</i>, may be raised 
in the petition."</p>
<p>The instant petition is not in accord with the Rule above quoted. It is not 
an appeal but an original action under Rule 67. Under this Rule, however, the 
petition is insufficient for want of necessary allegations, as already pointed 
out. But even if, despite petitioners' mistake in the choice of remedy, the 
petition be considered as an appeal by certiorari, it was still incumbent upon 
them to file their brief or memorandum within 10 days from receipt of the 
answers of respondents (Sec. 4, Rule 58). This petitioners have failed to do, 
and hence dismissal of the petition is in order, as prayed for by said 
respondents. Under whichever concept the petition is regarded petitioners have 
not raised any definite issues for this Court to resolve—whether errors of law 
corrective by appeal under Rule 44, or lack or excess of jurisdiction, or grave 
abuse of discretion, under Rule 67.</p>
<p>The record before us, in the form of annexes to the petition, is uncommonly 
voluminous. The decision alone runs to 304 typewritten pages. The formulation of 
issues devolves upon petitioners. Without them respondents would be at a loss to 
frame their answers, except to point out, as they did, the procedural lapse of 
petitioners. This Court, on its part, cannot wade through the mass of materials 
laid before it in search of points on which respondents Judge may have erred and 
which petitioners have failed to specify.</p>
<p>For failure of petitioners to file a brief or memorandum within the period 
prescribed by the Rules, the petition is dismissed, with costs.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>Regala, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>
