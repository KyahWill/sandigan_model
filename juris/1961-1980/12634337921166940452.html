				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a review <u>en <span class="SpellE">consulta</span></u> of
the decision of the Circuit Criminal Court at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
convicting <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> Dumdum, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Peralta of murder, sentencing each of them to death
and ordering them to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> a total indemnity
of P32<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span> (Criminal
Case No. 961).</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon of <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1971</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span>, 38, was stabbed in the national
penitentiary at <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sustained three <u>incised wounds</u>
located on the neck, right arm and left hand and eight <u>stab wounds</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>four on the chest, one on the abdomen, one on
the right shoulder and two in the lumbar region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wounds on the chest, which affected his
heart, lung, liver and stomach, were fatal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The victim died at the prison hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dumdum, 24, a native of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, a
prisoner serving sentence for theft, and Peralta, 21, a native of Iloilo City,
a prisoner serving sentence for robbery, both members of the Happy Go Lucky
gang, were investigated in the afternoon of the same day, September 7, 1971, in
connection with the <span style="">killing </span>of <span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">They declared in their confessions that they waited for the
victim and assaulted him when he passed in front of the Four Square Chapel of
the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim came from the hospital and was
going to the vocational school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fell
into the gutter with a bladed weapon sticking on his back.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dumdum stabbed <span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span> with an
improvised bladed weapon three times on the chest and abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peralta stabbed him five times also with an
improvised double-bladed weapon which he left in the victim's back when he
(Peralta) ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weapons were
presented in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing was planned an hour before it was perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motive was revenge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dumdum and Peralta purposed to avenge the
stabbing of <span class="SpellE">Lolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabella</span>,
the "mayor'' of their gang, by the <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> group
<span style="">belonging to the <span class="SpellE">Komando</span>
a</span>nd <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> gangs.</p>

<p class="BODY">A special prosecutor filed on <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1972</st1:date> <span class="GramE">an information</span>
for murder against Dumdum and Peralta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was alleged therein that the two accused while confined in prison and
as confederates armed <span style="">with improvised
weapons treacherously </span>assaulted <span class="SpellE">Macadangdang</span>
who was unarmed and who died as a result of the assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Premeditation was alleged as an aggravating
circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">At their arraignment, the accused were assisted by a counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The information was read to them in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, a
dialect which they know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they had
pleaded guilty, the trial judge asked them separately whether they knew when
they pleaded guilty that they would be punished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">They told the court that it was already a long time that they
thought of pleading guilty, that they were not forced to make that plea and
that due to remorse they had to admit the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge reminded the two accused that under article 160
of the Revised Penal Code he had no alternative but to impose upon them the
death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dumdum said that he knew
he would die in the electric chair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Peralta made the same admission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime after the arraignment, the trial court held a hearing
for the presentation of the prosecution's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two investigators who took the
confessions of the accused and the doctor who performed the autopsy
testified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were cross-examined by
the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecutor offered in evidence the two confessions, the
necropsy report, the photographs of the wounds and the two improvised bladed
weapons.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the trial court sentenced the two accused to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
in his brief argues that the trial court erred in convicting the accused on the
basis of their plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
contends that there was no showing that the accused had been properly arraigned
and that they were aware of the gravity of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court complied with its duty to see to it that the accused did
not make any improvident plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judicial confessions were confirmed by the evidence of the
prosecution which was sufficient for the conviction of the accused even if they
did not plead guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The guilt of the accused was established beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime committed by them is <span class="SpellE"><u>asesinato</u></span> qualified by treachery absorbing abuse of
superiority. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They deliberately
perpetrated a surprise assault on the unarmed victim without giving him a
chance to defend himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their confessions seem to indicate that the killing was
aggravated by evident premeditation because they conceived of the assault at
least one hour before its perpetration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if that circumstance is not taken into account, the penalty would
still be death in view of the special aggravating circumstance of
quasi-recidivism which justifies the imposition, in the maximum period, of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> maximum to death, the penalty for murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">For that same reason, the mitigating circumstances of plea of
guilty and voluntary surrender to the authorities would not preclude the
imposition of the death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case is similar to People vs. Santos and Vicente, 105
Phil. 40, People vs. Ala, 109 Phil. 390, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span>
and Romero, 109 Phil. 793, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span>, 111
Phil. 406, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Perete</span>, 111 Phil. 943, People
vs. Peralta, 113 Phil. 201, and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Layson</span>,
L-25177, October 31, 1969, 30 SCRA 92, where the accused prisoners killed their
fellow prisoners and were sentenced to death on the basis of their plea of
guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The stringent requirements of section 20, Article IV of the
Constitution as to extrajudicial confessions taken during custodial
interrogation are not applicable to this case because the confessions were
taken before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Constitution (See
Magtoto vs. Manguera, L-37201-02, Simeon vs. Villaluz, L-37424 and People vs.
Isnani, L-38929, all decided on March 3, 1975, 63 SCRA 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused herein did not impugn the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of their confessions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court committed an irregularity in pronouncing judgment
on the two accused in open court immediately after they had pleaded guilty and
then later on requiring the prosecution to present evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, that irregularity does not justify the setting aside of
the judgment of conviction which is supported by the judicial and extrajudicial
confessions of the accused and by other evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial judges are advised not to follow the erroneous, reverse
procedure adopted by the trial judge in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not correct to sentence the accused to
death immediately after he had pleaded guilty and then to require the
prosecutor to present his evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution should be presented after the
arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment should be
rendered and promulgated <u>after</u> the fiscal has presented his evidence and
after the trial court has ascertained that the defense is not presenting any evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the imposition of the death penalty, since as stated
in the main opinion of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, the two
accused with the assistance of counsel had pleaded guilty and their judicial
confessions were confirmed by the evidence nevertheless presented by the
prosecution, which was sufficient <u>per se</u> for their conviction even if
they had not pleaded guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">I write this brief opinion to maintain my dissenting view in the
cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Magtoto</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span></u>
(63 SCRA 4, 27) as against the <u>obiter dictum</u> in the main opinion that
extrajudicial confessions taken during custodial interrogation before the
effectivity of the 1973 Constitution from detained persons who are not assisted
by counsel nor informed of their right to counsel and to remain silent are
admissible in evidence thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 20 of the Bill of Rights (Article IV) of the 1973
Constitution explicitly provides (as against its one-sentence counterpart
provision in the 1935 Constitution) that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 20.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No person shall be compelled to be a witness
against himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person under
investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain
silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No force, violence, threat, intimidation, or
any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any confession obtained in violation of this
section shall be inadmissible in evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated in my dissent in <span class="SpellE"><u>Magtoto</u></span>,
joining dissents of the late Chief Justice Castro and the now Chief Justice,
"(T)here is <u>no room</u> for <u>interpretation</u> and the plain mandate
of the Cons­titution expressly adopting the <u>exclusionary rule</u> as the
only practical means of enforcing the constitutional injunction against such
confessions obtained in violation of one's constitutional rights by outlawing
their admission and thereby removing the incentive on the part of state and
police officers to disregard such rights (in the same manner that the
exclusionary rule bars admission of illegally seized evidence) should be
strictly enforced," and "(T)he outlawing of all such confessions is
plain, unqualified and <u>without distinction</u> whether the invalid
confession be obtained <u>before</u> or <u>after</u> the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the Constitution."</p>
