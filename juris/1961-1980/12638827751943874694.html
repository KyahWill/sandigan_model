Roberta <span class="SpellE">Verra</span>, the common-law wife of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Cordova, was subjected on the evening of <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1970</st1:date> in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mimamara</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mahaplag</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the other members of the family having retired for the night, she
was still up as there was a sick child under her care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, she noticed a bolo being thrust
through the floor made of bamboo slits. She peeped through an opening near the
kitchen and she saw appellant <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> Arias under
the <span class="SpellE"><u>banguera</u></span> holding a firearm, aiming it in
the direction of the kitchen door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately thereafter, there was a loud explosion caused by a shot
being fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she saw her husband prostrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was bathed in his own blood and was
groaning in pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His death, as
testified to by the Municipal Health Officer of the town who conducted an
autopsy three days thereafter, must have been instantaneous, with four bullet
wounds entering the left lung and heart and other bullets piercing the left
arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>
Arias, along with Javier <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasaylo</span>-on, were
prosecuted for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the first
two were convicted in view of the insufficiency of evidence against <span class="SpellE">Pasaylo</span>-on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of
them appealed with appellant <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> having died in
the meanwhile.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The remaining appellant is <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> Arias.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the lower court, as with us, his plea for
acquittal is based on an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
elsewhere when the fatal occurrence took place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge was not convinced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither are we.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was positive-identification
from Roberta <span class="SpellE">Verra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was bolstered by the circumstance testified to by another witness,
who saw him, along with the other accused, coming from the direction of the
fatal occurrence that same night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
a gun with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deference to the
well-settled doctrine as to the inherent weakness of such a defense when proof
of such a character is available calls for the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's guilt had
been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was shown by the evidence for the prosecution that on the
night of May 22, 1970, while the members of her family had already retired,
Roberta <span class="SpellE">Verra</span> was still up and awake because she was
attending to her sick child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then
that she saw somebody from underneath the house thrust a bolo through the floor
which was made of bamboo slits.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
She stood up and peeped through an opening near the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, she saw <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>
Arias under the <span class="SpellE"><u>banguera</u></span>, holding a firearm
and aiming it towards the door of the kitchen.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Immediately thereafter a shot was fired; her ears were deafened by the loud
blast of the gun report.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
She then heard her husband groaning and saw him bathed in his own blood.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Although she was terribly frightened, she rushed to her husband.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She likewise saw Javier <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasaylo</span>-on near the
ladder of their kitchen, the former with a short firearm.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Then she noticed the accused running towards the direction of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Balinsasayao</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It was not difficult for her to identify the accused as she had known appellant
Arias<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
for ten years and had recognized appellant <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>
who was a former landlord.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The moon was out, and there was a light coming from the lamp of the altar of
the Blessed Virgin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
premises of the house was clear of vegetation as the lot was tilled and was
newly planted with corn.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> She also testified that Javier <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> instituted a case for assault against her husband,
resulting in his imprisonment in <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> in 1970.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> He was released that same year.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a>
When her husband was shot, they were no longer tenants of Javier <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, as they were ejected from the land by him in 1969,
and her common-law husband intended to file a case against Javier <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> in the Court of Agrarian Relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>
She further testified that accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>
Arias was a tenant of Javier <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and even had a
house within the coconut plantation.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> There were no personal differences
between her and the appellant but it was only her common-law husband who was
nurturing one against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a> Another witness, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Verra</span>, residing in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Canmarating</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, testified
that on May 22, 1970, at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening, after fishing in
the <span class="SpellE">Layug</span> river, he went to the house of his tenant <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Cerbo</span>, where the corn
harvested was stored.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a> It was not till after midnight
that he arrived there.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a> On the way to <span class="SpellE">Cerbo's</span>
house, he met the three accused, namely, Javier <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> Arias and <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pasaylo</span>-on, all of whom were known to him and thus
immediately recognizable.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a> They were armed, <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> with a short firearm, Arias with a long one, and <span class="SpellE">Pasaylo</span>-on with a bolo tucked in his waist.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
There was no difficulty knowing who they were because it was a moonlit night,
the sky was clear, and the area where they met without any vegetation except
corn newly planted, just four (4) inches tall.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a> While they were armed, he was not
afraid, because they just crossed ways and they were walking rather briskly.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court relying on such evidence found the two accused
appellants <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> Arias and the now-deceased Javier
<span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> guilty of the crime of murder beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of alibi
interposed by them was rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> Arias as the sole appellant did continue to press
such a claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deference to a long list
of our decisions especially so where the culpability of an accused is shown not
only by identification but by other circumstantial evidence demonstrates the
futility of such effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v.
Berame,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
decided less than a year ago, is the latest case in point.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easily
understandable why the identification of an accused as a participant in the
commission of an offense by evidence that is worthy of credence and belief
negates the claim of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The falsity
of an assertion that he was elsewhere and therefore could not have been guilty
of the crime imputed to him becomes apparent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the proof of his presence then is clear and positive, such a
defense is unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language
of Justice Laurel in People v. Caroz:<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a> "Alibis cannot stand and prevail
over clear and convincing affirmation of credible witnesses."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a>
Such a doctrine is of respectable lineage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was first announced by Justice Torres in United States v. Roque,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a> a
1908 decision, where the accused "was recognized with rare unanimity by
five eyewitnesses to the sequestration as being one of the four armed
individuals who in the early morning of the 23rd of June, 1904, abducted the
deceased, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a> Since then, as pointed out by
Justice Trent in United States v. Lasada,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a> promulgated two years later, alibi
cannot avail as against "the positive and direct testimony"<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a>
of the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
host of cases indicates how authoritative is such a doctrine.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony that came
from Roberta <span class="SpellE">Verra</span>, the common-law wife, was clear
and positive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was an eyewitness to
the tragic occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a dolorous
event must have left an indelible impression in her mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was seen by her, through an opening
near the kitchen holding a long firearm aimed at that direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the shot fatal in its
consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It hit her husband in
vital spots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was groaning, bathed in
his own blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant with the two
other accused were seen by her running away from the scene of the crime. She
could not possibly have been mistaken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a moonlit night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
nothing to obstruct the view, with the premises around the house devoid of
vegetation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was no stranger to
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had known him for ten years at
least.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32 </span></span></a>Parenthetically,
it may be noted that the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> evidence coming
from a bereaved widow identifying the malefactor has usually elicited
acceptance from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
case of record is United States v. Lumanlan,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a> a 1915 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An excerpt from the opinion of Justice Laurel
in People v. De Guzman<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">34</span></span></a> fits the situation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Appellants claim that their identity
has not been sufficiently established, much less their participation in the
crime of which they were convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have carefully examined the record and are convinced that the appellants were
among those who perpetrated the robbery against <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dungca</span> and Julia <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span>
and who mercilessly raped Julia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants were well known to Julia and the latter identified them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Julia, also, had sufficient time to recognize
their features while they were successively abusing her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the appellants sought the darkness of
the night, detection on the part of the offended woman was facilitated by the
moonlight then piercing the house."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a> There are several other decisions
of a similar nature since then.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36</span></span></a> Nor is this all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a circumstantial evidence equally
persuasive as to the guilt of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Along with the other two accused, he was seen leaving the vicinity of
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such testimony came from
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Verra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was entitled to credence, and the lower court believed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It admits of no doubt therefore that
appellant was positively identified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, his presence at the place where the criminal act occurred
was likewise established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His defense of
alibi was thus completely discredited.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision is
quite exhaustive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court
discussed in detail the evidence submitted by both the prosecution and the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took pains to arrive at the
truth of the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not just
ignore the claim of appellant that he could not have committed the offense as
he was nowhere near the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather it was guided by the authoritative doctrine, succinctly stated by
Justice Laurel, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The defense
of alibi is always received with caution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be proved by probable evidence which reasonably satisfies the
court of the truth of such defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alibis cannot stand and prevail over clear and convincing testimonies of
credible witnesses".<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a> It was on that basis that it
rendered the judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a thorough appraisal of the evidence, hearing and observing the
witnesses and weighing what was said by them, it reached that conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So do we, and not solely on the equally
well-settled principle that the finding of facts by the trial judge is to
remain undisturbed, absent a showing of a fact or circumstance which has been
overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of September 21, 1971 is
affirmed insofar as it found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
