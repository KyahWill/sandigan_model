				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Direct appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan 
dated February 29, 1960, finding appellants guilty of murder, and sentencing 
them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusión perpetua</i>; to indemnify, jointly 
and severally, the heirs of the deceased Felix Jugo in the sum of P6,000.00; and 
to pay the costs.
<p>The prosecution's version of the incident runs as follows: That around 5:00 
o'clock p.m. of December 26, 1959, while the late Felix Jugo was walking along a 
trail in barrio Bolo, San Jacinto, Pangasinan, on his way to sell eggs, he was 
suddenly attacked by the three (3) Villegas brothers, Marciano, Emigdio, and 
Alfredo. Marciano struck Felix at the back of the head with an iron pipe, while 
the two other brothers hurled stones at him. When Felix fell to the ground, 
Marciano continued to hit him with the iron pipe. The son of Felix, Gabriel 
Jugo, who was then walking behind at a distance of about 50 meters, upon seeing 
his father fall, tried to succor him, but Emigdio and Alfredo stoned and chased 
him away from the scene. Gabriel informed an elder brother of what happened to 
their father, after which the barrio lieutenant was also notified. While the 
barrio lieutenant went to the scene of the killing, Gabriel's elder brother 
reported the incident to the police authorities at the San Jacinto poblacion, 
but only the following day did the Chief of Police, with the Provincial Sanitary 
Inspector, arrive on the scene and inspect the corpse of the deceased. He was 
found lying face downward, with an iron pipe (Exh. "B") and a stone stained with 
red (Exhibit "C") beside him. Upon examination conducted by the Provincial 
Sanitary Inspector, the deceased was found to have sustained fifteen 
incised-like wounds, bruises, swellings, and scratches as contained in Exhibit 
"A".</p>
<p>The defense does not dispute that at around 5:00 p.m. of December 26, 1959, 
Felix Jugo was killed by Marciano Villegas; but it contends that Marciano did so 
in self-defense. The evidence for the defense tends to establish that on the day 
and hour already mentioned, appellants Marciano, Emigdio, and Alfredo, along 
with Antonio Baguio, were resting and conversing in front of the latter's house 
in barrio Bolo, San Jacinto, Pangasinan. Shortly thereafter, Gabriel Jugo passed 
by, accompanied by a boy brother-in-law and Juan Narvasa. Gabriel saw Emigdio 
and accused him of being a chicken thief, Gabriel assumed a belligerent attitude 
but was pacified by Antonio Baguio and Federico Ronquillo. Then Gabriel sent his 
boy companion to fetch his father (Felix) "as the chicken thieves were there". 
When Felix Jugo arrived, he immediately rushed at Marciano, who was then near 
his own house, and hit the latter with an iron pipe (Exhibit "3" for defense; 
Exhibit "B" for Prosecution). Supporting his father, Gabriel Jugo boloed 
Marciano Villegas on the right buttock. Emigdio joined the affray, casting 
stones at Gabriel, while Alfredo rushed at him with a stick or cane. Thereupon, 
Gabriel ran away, pursued by Emigdio and Alfredo. Meanwhile, Marciano and Felix 
grappled with each other; the former was able to wrest away the iron pipe from 
Felix Jugo after parrying two blows with his left arm. Getting a piece of bamboo 
to rearm himself, (Exhibit 4), Felix was about to strike again at Marciano when 
the latter hit him several times with the iron pipe he had grabbed from Felix. 
All this time, Emigdio and Alfredo were chasing Gabriel, and when they came 
back, Felix was already on the ground, dead.</p>
<p>In convicting all the appellants of murder, the lower court gave full credit 
to the prosecution's version, culled almost exclusively from the testimony of 
two alleged eyewitnesses—Gabriel Jugo and Lorenzo Abuan. Certain circumstances, 
however, fail to inspire confidence in the complete veracity of their 
narrative.</p>
<p>We find the account of the killing by these prosecution witnesses so sketchy 
and nebulous as to engender the suspicion that material points have been 
concealed to compose a predetermined pattern of the incident. In describing the 
alleged details of the killing, and only after much prodding, all Gabriel Jugo 
could say was that, from behind, Marciano hit his father on the head with an 
iron pipe, while Emigdio and Alfredo Villegas threw stones, also hitting his 
father on the back of the head; that when his father fell, Marciano still hit 
him several times, and killed him. Note that except for the allegedly 
treacherous assault and the participation of Emigdio and Alfredo in throwing 
stones at the deceased, this account of the killing is perfectly consistent with 
that of the defense, which admits that Marciano killed Felix with an iron pipe. 
To better emphasize treachery, this witness averred that the place of ambush was 
along a trail with tall, overgrown bushes and talahib; but the assertion is 
disproved by the Provincial Sanitary Inspector who testified that there were no 
tall grasses at the place of the killing, and that in fact, it was in an open 
field. The Chief of Police likewise estimated the height of the grass in the 
vicinity to be no more than about one foot.</p>
<p>The prosecution would have it believed that appellants purposely waited along 
the trail for their victim, who was then carrying eggs, and from the bushes, 
treacherously pounced on their quarry from behind. If the deceased was carrying 
eggs—about 40 in number, Gabriel said—it is unexplained why no trace of these 
eggs, of their remains, or even just of their container, was ever found by 
anybody at or near the spot of the killing. Also Emigdio and Alfredo had not 
armed themselves and used weapons no more effective than stones. This fact tends 
to negative a premeditated waylaying.</p>
<p>Gabriel Jugo charged that the two Villegas brothers chased him with bolos and 
stones; and Lorenzo Abuan (who turns out to be a tenant of the private 
prosecutor) also said in passing that Alfredo carried a bolo. This claim is 
belied by the fact that among the injuries inflicted on the deceased, not one 
was caused by a bolo; while Gabriel, professedly confronted by two armed 
adversaries, not only managed to wound one of them, but escaped unscathed from 
the unequal encounter.</p>
<p>It may also be observed that if the three Villegas brothers had deliberately 
ambushed Felix Jugo, they would not have done so at a spot close to their 
dwellings, for they would have sensed that by so doing, suspicion would 
immediately fall upon them. All in all, the evidence for the prosecution fails 
to establish the guilt of appellants beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that the deceased was the aggressor in the affray is 
sufficiently established by the record. Not only Marciano and Alfredo Villegas, 
but Antonio Baguio and Juan Narvasa as well, bystanders during the incident, 
clearly and convincingly described the events leading to the attack unleashed by 
the deceased Felix Jugo on appellant Marciano Villegas. Juan Narvasa was, in 
fact, with Gabriel Jugo as the latter passed by and upbraided Emigdio Villegas, 
and then sent for his father. Federico Ronquillo, another bystander and 
originally listed as a prosecution witness in the complaint before the trial 
court, would have corroborated the aggression by the deceased against appellant 
Marciano, but his presentation was dispensed with upon admission by the 
prosecution of the corroborative nature of his testimony. These witnesses do not 
appear related to appellants or impelled by any improper motive that would 
discredit their account of the unlawful aggression committed by the deceased. 
Moreover, there is evidence that the late Felix Jugo was notoriously a bully, a 
trouble-seeker given to violent acts, who had tangled even with some members of 
the local police force. It is not surprising, therefore, that he should respond 
violently to a summons from his son, Gabriel, for him to come as the chicken 
thieves had been found; and armed with an iron pipe, to give vent to his anger 
upon arriving at the scene and finding the appellants herein, whom he believed 
to have stolen his chickens. This was not the first time that the deceased had 
taken an aggressive attitude toward Marciano, because just three days prior to 
the fatal incident, the deceased admittedly had challenged Marciano Villegas to 
a fight over some wood which allegedly came from the land leased by Felix.</p>
<p>The nature of the killing as an offshoot of a spontaneous turn of events—not 
a previously conceived ambush - is seen by the use of stones by Emigdio and 
Alfredo, weapons unlikely to be chosen in the cool calculation of a treacherous 
ambuscade. No eggs, or traces thereof, were found in the vicinity of the 
killing, because in fact, the deceased was not on his way to sell eggs, but to 
accost appellants and have it out with them, as the defense witnesses 
asserted.</p>
<p>The number of wounds appearing in the medical certificate Exhibit "A" does 
not necessarily indicate murder, because many of these wounds were only bruises, 
swellings and scratches. Besides, the use of blunt instruments in combat should 
be expected to ordinarily produce more wounds than other more deadly weapons, 
since the struggle usually would last longer. Of course, the number of wounds 
would indicate that contrary to what has been asserted by the defense, the 
deceased was not hit by Marciano only three times.</p>
<p>We are convinced that there was unlawful aggression on the part of Felix Jugo 
without sufficient provocation from Marciano Villegas; but it has not been 
satisfactorily shown that there was reasonable necessity for the killing of the 
former. The test of reasonableness depends not only on the character of the 
weapon employed, but also on the physical condition, age, size and other 
circumstances pertaining to the combatants. Compared to Felix, who was about 60 
years old, Marciano, who was about 36, was relatively still at the peak of 
manhood. With his relative youth, taller stature, and bigger build, no impelling 
danger is shown to have threatened Marciano's life, after he had wrested the 
iron pipe from Felix, as to necessitate his dealing mortal blows on the latter 
until he died. Also, the presence at the scene of Marciano's two brothers, whose 
cooperation could certainly be counted upon, precluded a reasonable chance of 
Felix being able to turn the tables on Villegas. We cannot believe that the 
deceased was yet able to pick up a bamboo cane (Exh. "4") with which, allegedly, 
he tried again to strike Marciano. This cane was not found by the authorities at 
the scene of the crime. It follows that Marciano, while the victim of an 
unprovoked aggression, is still liable for homicide.</p>
<p>As to appellants Emigdio and Alfredo, the evidence as a whole would show that 
they were not entirely free from participation in the killing of the deceased. 
The numerous contusions inflicted on the deceased support the assertion that 
they threw stones at the deceased, but during the struggle between Marciano and 
the deceased, after the latter had attacked the former with the iron pipe. 
Absolutely no evidence exists to prove that any stone thrown by either Emigdio 
or Alfredo inflicted any mortal injury on Felix Jugo, nor does it appear that 
they joined Marciano in hitting the deceased after the latter crashed to the 
ground from Marciano's blows. Thus, the form and manner of assistance by Emigdio 
and Alfredo does not safely disclose that unity of purpose and design and 
compulsion by a common motive that would make them co- principals with the 
actual slayer, Marciano. At most, they could only be held liable as accomplices, 
in that they cooperated in the execution of the offense by simultaneous acts 
which were not indispensable (People <i>vs</i>. Tumayao, 56 Phil., 587; People 
<i>vs</i>. Tamayo, 44 Phil., 38; People <i>vs</i>. Cortez, 55 Phil., 143).</p>
<p>We, therefore, hold appellant Marciano guilty of homicide, punishable with 
<i>reclusión temporal</i> under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. Having 
acted in incomplete self-defense, with the majority of the requisites for 
justification concurring, the penalty should be reduced one degree lower, i.e., 
to <i>prisión mayor</i>, pursuant to Article 69, in connection with paragraph 2, 
Article 61, and Article 71, of the Code, to be imposed in its minimum period, 
since this accused voluntarily surrendered to the authorities, and no 
aggravating circumstance is present that would offset this mitigating 
circumstance. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, appellant Marciano should 
be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 4 years and 2 months of 
<i>prisión correccional</i> to 6 years and 1 day of <i>prisión mayor</i>, with 
the accessories provided by law.</p>
<p>As accomplices to the homicide, the acts of Emigdio and Alfredo are 
punishable by <i>prisión mayor</i>, under Article 52 in connection with Article 
71, of the Penal Code. Since Emigdio and Alfredo acted in defense of their 
brother, Marciano, in the face of an unlawful aggression without provocation, 
the penalty should be reduced by at least one degree, pursuant to Article 69 of 
the Code, or to <i>prisión correccional</i>, to be imposed in its medium period, 
no other modifying circumstances being present.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision subject of review is set aside, and 
another is entered finding appellants guilty only of homicide; sentencing 
appellant Marciano Villegas to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 4 years and 
2 months of <i>prisión correccional</i> to 6 years and 1 day of <i>prisión 
mayor</i>, with the accessories provided by law; and to indemnify the heirs of 
the deceased in the sum of P3,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency. Appellants Emigdio and Alfredo Villegas, as accomplices, are 
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty not less than 6 months of <i>arresto 
mayor</i>, and not more than 2 years, 4 months and 1 day of <i>prisión 
correccional</i> with the accessories provided by law; and, jointly and 
severally to pay the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P3,000.00 by way of 
indemnity with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.</p>
<p>In case of the insolvency of Marciano Villegas as principal, then, Emigdio 
and Alfredo Villegas, as accomplices, shall be subsidiarily liable, jointly and 
severally, for the indemnity due from said principal; and should Emigdio and 
Alfredo Villegas be insolvent, Marciano Villegas, as principal, shall be 
subsidiarily liable for their share of the indemnity (Article 110, Revised Penal 
Code; People <i>vs</i>. Cortez, <i>supra</i>.).</p>
<p>Costs against appellants in both instances.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, 
Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and 
<i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
