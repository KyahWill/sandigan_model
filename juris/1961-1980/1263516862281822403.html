				<H3>IN RE:  FLORENCIO
MALLARE
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By our original decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1968</st1:date>, we declared that, according to the evidence
submitted at his investigation, respondent <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span> admitted to the practice of law in <span class="GramE">1962,</span> was not really a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of our decision was of the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span> is hereby
declared excluded from the practice of law; his admission to the Philippine bar
is revoked and he is hereby ordered to return immediately to this Court the
lawyer's diploma pre­viously issued <span class="GramE">to</span> him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let a copy of this decision be furnished, when it becomes
final, to the Secretary of Justice, for such action as may be deemed warranted;
and let an­other copy be sent to the Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Macalelon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, for purposes
of record in the corresponding civil registry of births."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After several motions for reconsideration had been denied,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span> filed a petition for reopening,
and new trial, predicated upon the discovery of an entry in the Register of
Baptisms of the Parish of the Immaculate Conception of <span class="SpellE">Macalelon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> (now <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>),
bearing No. 5 at rage 147, attesting to the fact that respondent's late father,
Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>, was baptized as the natural son of
Ana <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>, "<span class="SpellE">india</span> <span class="SpellE">soltera</span> de <span class="SpellE">este</span> pueblo" and
an unknown father.</p>

<p class="BODY">This document, if authentic, would greatly tend to support, in
con­junction with other evidences on record, the claim of respondent that his
father was a citizen of the Philippines, which citizenship was acquired by
herein respondent upon his birth in the Philippines, his Chinese mother Te Na
having followed Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mallare's</span> nationality upon
her marriage to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent further submits the affidavit of one <span class="SpellE">Damiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabañgon</span>, who allegedly
was the "<span class="SpellE">hilot</span>" who attended Ana <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span> and that the latter had no husband when she gave
birth to Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>; and that of respon­dent's
mother Te Na, that she had erroneously registered her son, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>,
as an alien in 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Immigration has opposed the reopening on the
ground that the evidence proposed to be introduced by herein respondent is not
newly discovered, but forgotten evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the respondent, as a duly admitted member of the
bar, should be given ample opportunity to establish the true facts about his
citizenship and that no effort should be spared to ascertain the truth before
stripping him of the privilege granted to him by this Court since 1962, and
denying him the practice of his chosen profession which he has honorably
discharged as far as the records show:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court <u>Resolved</u> to set aside the decision of April 29,
1968 and to grant the reopening and new trial prayed for, which shall take
place before the Court's Investigating Officer on the days specified by him
upon notice to respondent <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>, the Commissioner
of Immigration and the Solicitor General, wherein said parties may adduce all
proper additional evidence that they may desire to present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proofs taken at the original
investigation shall not he retaken, but considered as part of the evidence in
the new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the Court
Investigator shall submit his report to this Tribunal.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span><span style=""> </span></p>
