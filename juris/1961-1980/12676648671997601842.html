<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 26, 1958, former 
President Carlos P. Garcia appointed petitioner <i>ad interim</i> Chairman of 
the Board of Examiners for Chemists, for a term expiring July 15, 1961. This 
appointment was submitted to, and was confirmed by the Commission on 
Appointments and petitioner duly qualified and discharged the duties of the 
office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 16, 1961, petitioner was 
reappointed as Acting Chairman of the same Board. On November 6 of the same 
year, President Garcia signed petitioner's <i>ad interim</i> appointment to the 
office for another term expiring on July 15, 1964. This <i>ad interim</i> <span class="GramE">appointment,</span> however was not released and delivered to 
petitioner, as conclusively indicated by the fact that the original thereof 
remained in the Office of the President. Respondent, however, admits that a copy 
thereof was transmitted to the Commission on Appointments on December 26, 1961, 
on the basis of which said Commission took cognizance of the appointment and 
confirmed it on May 17, 1962. Then on July 31; 1962, the Commissioner of Civil 
Service informed petitioner that his last <i>ad interim </i>appointment had been 
recalled, withdrawn, and declared without effect by virtue of Administrative 
Order No. 2, dated December 31, 1961, and on November 5, 1962, President <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> appointed 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Yenko</span> as Acting Chairman of the Board of 
Examiners for Chemists, who thereafter assumed the functions and duties of said 
office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 14, 1962, petitioner 
filed the petition now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> praying that 
we:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"1. Declare null and void the 
designation of respondent as Acting Chairman of the Board of Examiners for 
Chemists;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. Declare as valid, legal and 
subsisting petitioner's appointment as Chairman of the Board of Examiners for 
Chemists for a term <span class="GramE">expiring</span> on July 16, 1964, which 
appointment has been duly confirmed by the Commission on 
Appointment;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3. By way of provisional remedy, 
issue a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining and restraining respondent from 
performing any act pursuant to his appointment 
aforementioned;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">4. Permanently prohibit 
respondent from assuming said office and from performing any of the duties and 
obligations thereof during the term of office of 
petitioner;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">5. Sentence respondent to pay for 
the costs of this suit; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">6. Grant such other relief as may 
be deemed just and equitable under the 
premises."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It will be noticed that the 
petition under consideration does not allege that the original of the last ad 
interim appointment was transmitted to, and was received by petitioner—obviously 
because said original was never released by the Office of the President. Neither 
does it allege that, upon receipt thereof, petitioner had accepted the 
appointment and duly qualified for the position by taking the corresponding oath 
of office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In relation to the above matters, 
petitioner merely alleges that by virtue of his designation as Acting Chairman 
and later by virtue of the last ad interim appointment, "petitioner performed 
the duties and obligations of Chairman" of the Board of Examiners for Chemists 
and enjoyed all the rights and privileges appurtenant thereto. Further on this 
matter, in an affidavit attached to his memorandum as Annex A, petitioner could 
go no further than to state that on November 9, 1961, the then Acting Executive 
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallares</span> 
notified him by telephone that his last ad interim appointment had already been 
signed by President Garcia and was ready for submission to the Commission on 
Appointments, and that on a subsequent social occasion in <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span>, President Garcia himself told him that his ad 
interim appointment had already been signed by him. These allegations are not 
sufficient to take the place of a clear allegation and <i>proof</i> that the ad 
interim appointment aforesaid was not only signed but was <i>released </i>to 
petitioner, and that by virtue thereof, he had accepted it and duly qualified 
for the position. We are of the opinion, therefore, that, on the basis of 
petitioner's own allegations, his last ad interim appointment was incomplete and 
that, as a result, there was in fact and in law no ad interim appointment that 
could be validly transmitted to, and acted upon by the Commission on 
Appointments on May 17, 1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, petitioner having failed to 
allege and prove that he is rightfully entitled to the Office of Chairman of the 
Board of Examiners for Chemists, the petition under consideration is hereby 
dismissed, without costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
