was suspended from office as acting second assistant general manager of the Phi­lippine
Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration (PRATRA), pending the outcome of
criminal charges filed against him and one Faustino Gomez by the city fiscal of
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> (<span class="SpellE">crim</span>.

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1950" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1950</st1:date>
the PRATRA was abolished, and the Price Stabilization Corporation (PRISCO) was
created (Ex. Order 350, Oct. <span style="">3,
1950).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In a decision rendered by
the CFI of Manila in said criminal case on <st1:date year="1952" day="9" month="6">June <span style="">9, </span>1952</st1:date>,
Nico­las was acquitted of all the charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PRIS­CO thereafter paid him his salary

well as the money value of all his earned and unused vacation and sick leaves
up to and including the last date <span style="">mentioned,
</span>and, upon his application, a gratuity corresponding to his entire
service in the Government from July 29, 1946 up to October 2, 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he demanded from the PRISCO, and
later from the NAMARCO,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
payment of his accrued salary and the money value of his earned and unused
vacation and sick leaves corresponding to the period of his suspension from <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1950</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1952" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1952</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both entities denied the claim on the ground
that he was not entitled to any salary after <st1:date year="1950" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1950</st1:date> because the PRATRA <span style="">was </span>abolished on the following day.</p>

Maria L. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Misa</span> and a
legally adopted child Milagros <span class="SpellE">Misa</span> Gutierrez, for
the recovery of the salary claimed by the deceased, less a sum equivalent to
4-2/12 month's salary, at the rate of P10,800 per annum, the money value
corresponding to the earned and unused vacation and sick leaves, plus legal
interest on the total sum from June 9, 1952, until fully paid, and P5,000
attorney's fees, aside from costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
alleged that the defendant is liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> as the
universal successor-in-interest of the PRISCO which, in turn, was also the
universal successor-in-interest of the PRATRA, and which entities (PRISCO and
NAMARCO) suc­ceeded to all the rights and assumed all the obligations of the
PRATRA; and that the deceased <span style="">is </span>entitled
to his sala­ries and the money value of his earned and unused vacation and sick
leaves corresponding to the entire period of his suspension, because he had not
been dismissed or separated from the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Liability is disclaimed by the NAMARCO, which avers that it is
not the universal successor-in-interest of the PRISCO, pursuant to R.A. 1345;
that it was justified in refusing to satisfy the claim of the deceased,
invoking section 12 of Exec. Order 350 which provides that the personnel of the
PRATRA, transferred to the PRISCO, "shall be reappointed in the PRISCO and
those not reappointed within sixty days from the effective date of this Order
(Oct. 3, 1950) shall be considered separated from the service" and that
since the deceased was not extended a reappointment by the PRISCO, he is considered
as having been separated from the service as of October 3, 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing Lopez vs. Board of Directors and
General Manager of the NAMARCO (101 Phil. 349), the defendant further asserted
that the deceased, and the plaintiffs as his heirs, are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from questioning the validity of his separation from the service, <span style="">for </span>he applied for and was paid his
gratuity pay of 4-2/12 months corresponding to the entire period of his service
with the Government, aside from his salary up to <span style="">and including October 2, 1950, and the money value of all his earned
and unused vacation and sick leaves up to the said date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the issues were
joined, the plaintiffs filed a </span><span style="">"Mo­tion
</span><span style="">for Summary Judgment",
alleging that there is no substan­tial controversy </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to the facts of the case, and "whatever <u>seeming</u> or apparent

other direct and unavailable documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
