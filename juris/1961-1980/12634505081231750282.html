Mariano <span class="SpellE">Sumilang</span> filed in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> a petition for the probate of a document
alleged to be the last will and testament of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ramagosa</span>, who died on <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said document, written in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> and dated <st1:date year="1949" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1949</st1:date>, institutes
petitioner as sole heir of the testator.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for probate was opposed by two (2) sets of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> - appellants herein - who questioned the due
execution of the document, claiming that it was made under duress and was not
really intended by the deceased to be his last will and testament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from merely opposing the petition for
probate, the first set of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> - <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Ramagosa</span> -
also claimed that they, instead of petitioner, were entitled to inherit the
estate of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, representing themselves simply as next of kin,
appropriately prayed only for the disallowance of the will.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearings of the petition petitioner adduced his evidence,
and then rested his case on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Reception of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>'
evidence was set for <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1961</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> moved
for the dismissal of the petition for probate mainly on the ground that
"the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject-matter because the last
will and testament of the decedent, if ever it was really executed by him, was
revoked by implication of law six years before his death."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span> alleged
that after making the will <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramagosa</span> sold to petitioner Mariano <span class="SpellE">Sumilang</span>
and his brother Mario the parcels of land described therein, so that at the
time of the testator's <span class="GramE">death</span> the titles to said lands
were no longer in his name.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed his opposition to the motion for dismissal on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1961</st1:date>, supplemented it by
another opposition on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1961</st1:date>,
and by a rejoinder on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1962</st1:date> petitioner moved to strike out the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>' pleadings on two grounds, namely:</p>

<blockquote>“1. That <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> have no legal
standing in court and they are bereft of personality to oppose the probate of
the last will and testament of the testator; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. <span style="">That <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> have no valid claim and interest in the
distribution of (the) estate of the aforesaid testator and no existing valid
right whatsoever."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1963</st1:date>
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> issued the order now subject of this appeal,
which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting on the motion to dismiss filed by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> dated July 31, 1961, the same is hereby denied
for the allegations contained therein goes (sic) to the very intrinsic value of
the will and other grounds stated on said motion <span style="">to dismiss are without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the motion to strike out opposition and all other
pleadings of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> filed by the petitioner, it
appears that <span class="SpellE">opposi­tors</span> have no relationship
whatsoever with­in the fifth degree </span>as <span style="">provided by law and therefore the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
are totally strangers to the deceased whose will is under probate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, the motion to strike out
opposition and all other pleadings pertinent thereto is hereby ordered stricken
out of the record."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition below being for the probate of a will, the court's
area of inquiry is limited to the <u>extrinsic</u> <span style="">validity thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testator's
testamentary </span><span style="">capacity </span>and
the compliance with the formal requisites or solemnities prescribed by law are
the only questions presented for the resolution of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any inquiry into the <u><span style="">intrinsic</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">validity or efficacy of
the provisions of the will or the legality of any devise or legacy is
premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Nu­guid</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span>, G. R. No.</span>

<blockquote>"To establish conclusively as against everyone and once for
all, the facts that a will was executed with the formalities required by law
and that the testator was in a con­dition to make a will, is the only purpose
of the proceedings . . . for the probate of a will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment in such proceedings determines
and can determine nothing more."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Alemany</span>, et al., vs. CFI of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
3 Phil. 424)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span> would want the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> to dismiss the petition for probate on the ground that the testator
had impliedly revoked his will by selling, prior to his death, the lands
disposed of therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">True or not, the alleged sale is no ground for the dismissal of
the petition for probate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Probate is one
thing; the validity of the testamentary provisions is another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first decides the execution of the
document and the testamentary capacity of the testator; the second relates to
descent and distribution.</p>

<blockquote>"The alleged revocation implied from the execution of the deeds
of conveyance in favor of the testamentary heir is plainly irrelevant to and
separate from the question of whether the testament was duly executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, if the will is not entitled to
probate, or its probate is denied, all questions of revocation become
superfluous:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in law, there is no such
will and hence there would be nothing to revoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, again, the revocation invoked by the <span class="SpellE">opposi­tors</span>-appellants is not an express one, but merely
implied from subsequent acts of the testatrix allegedly evidencing an
abandonment of the original intention to bequeath or devise the properties
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the revocation would
not affect the will itself, but merely the particular devise or legacy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Fer­nandez, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimagiba</span>,
L-23638 and <span class="SpellE">and</span> Reyes et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimagiba</span>,
L-23662, October 12, 1967)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their brief, <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> do not take issue with the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo's</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">finding that they
"have no relationship what­soever within the fifth degree as provided by
law and there­fore . . . are totally (sic) strangers to the deceased whose will
is under probate."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not
attempt to </span>show <span style="">that they have
some interest in the estate which must be protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
evidence, consisting of certified true copies of the parties' baptism and
marriage certificates, </span>support the said court's finding in this respect.</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"It is a well-settled
rule that in order that a person may be allowed to </span>intervene in a
probate proceeding he must have an interest in the estate, or in the will, or
in the property to be affected by it either as executor or as a claimant of the
estate (Ngo The <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> vs. Chung <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hua</span>, et al., L-17091, September 30, 1963); and an
interested party has been defined as one who would be benefited by the estate
such as an heir or one who has a claim against the estate like a
creditor."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Teo­tico</span>
vs. <span class="GramE">del</span> Val, etc., G. R. No. L-18753, <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1965</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The reason for the rule excluding strangers from contesting
the will, is not that thereby the court maybe prevented from learning facts
which would justify or necessitate a denial of probate but rather that the
courts and the litigants should not be molested by the intervention in the
proceedings of persons with no interest in the estate which would entitle them
to be heard with relation thereto." (<span class="SpellE">Paras</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, 35 Phil. 244)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Sometime
after this case was elevated to this Court <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order appealed from is
interlocutory.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We deferred action on the motion until after
the brief of both parties had been filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion, although now practically academic in </span>view <span style="">of our resolution of the main issues
involved, must be denied, since the order of the lower court striking out
appellants' opposition to the probate of the will on the ground that they have
no personality to intervene in the case, was final and therefore <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> order in so far as they were concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
