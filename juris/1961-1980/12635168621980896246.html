				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On December 29, 1955, petitioner Champion Paper Products <span style="">Manufacturing Corporation, a domestic </span>corporation
with business address at Room 319, <span style="">Equitable
Bank Building, Juan Luna, Manila, </span>filed with the Philippines Patent
Office petition for the registration of the trademark CHAMPION - with <span style="">a design shown on the drawing </span>attached
thereto - alleging that it had been exclusively and continuously using said
trademark since January 31, 1955 on the goods (Class 38) specified in the
Statement of its President &amp; General Manager attached to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the publication required by law and upon the favorable
recommendation of the Supervising Trademark Examiner, <span style="">the Director of Patents, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="6"><span style="">June 22, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, issued a certificate of registration (No.
7410) of said trademark in favor of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 31, 1959, private respondent Champion Papers, Inc.
(formerly Champion Paper and <span class="SpellE">Fibre</span> Company), a
foreign corporation, filed with the same office en application (No. 7228) for
the registration of the trademark CHAMPION (word only).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This trademark was registered in its name on <st1:date year="1952" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1952</st1:date> (Certificate No. 3434)
but said registra­tion was cancelled on <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1958</st1:date> for failure of the registrant to file
the affidavit of use required by Section 12 of the Trademark Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Believing that private respondent's application No. 7228 might
adversely affect petitioner's registration of trademark No. 7410, the Trademark
Examiner, on August 11, 1960, declared an interference between the two, in
accordance with Section 10-A of Republic Act No. 166, <span style="">as </span>amended (Inter <span class="SpellE">Partes</span> Case No.
194).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 30, 1960, petitioner <span style="">filed motion to dissolve </span>the interference on the ground that,
although the trademarks were identical and the goods end products of the
interested parties belonged to the same classification (Class 38), the danger
of confusion or deception to the buying public was remote because the products
involved were not bought by the same class of purchasers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent formally opposed the
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1961</st1:date>,
the Chief Trademark Examiner of the Philippines Patent Office issued <span style="">a </span>resolution
dissolving the interference, holding that the likelihood of confusion was
remote as the average purchasers and the essential characteristics of the goods
on which the trademarks were used were not the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 20 of the same year, private
respondent appealed from said resolution to the Director of Patents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, the
interference case (Inter <span class="SpellE">Partes</span> Case No. 194) was set
for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="1"><span style="">January 25, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, apparently for the purpose of receiving
evidence for the determination of the question of "confusing
similarity" of the trademarks mentioned heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this, on January 10 of the same
year, private respondent filed </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">motion praying that it be
allowed to file its appeal brief within 30 days from the date </span><span style="">the interference case would </span><span style="">have been tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="1"><span style="">January 19, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner filed an opposition to the
motion praying, in turn, that private respondents appeal be dismissed for its
failure to file its brief within 60 days from the date of the appeal, pursuant
to </span>Rule 203 of the Revised Rules <span style="">of
Practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the date set for the
hearing of the interference case, petitioner questioned the authority of the Hearing
Officer to hold it, alleging that the interference had already been dissolved
and that </span>the <span style="">case was already on
appeal to the Director of Patents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Af</span><span style="">te</span><span style="">r
the parties had submitted memoranda on the matter, the Director of Patents, on
April 3, 1962, issued </span>a <span style="">resolution
(No. 4, Series of 1962; Annex T attached to Petition) setting aside the action
of the Chief Trademark Examiner dissolving the interference and setting the
case for hearing on April 30, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of the same and, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="2"><span style="">February
 13, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Director of Patents issued an order of this tenor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is hereby ordered as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Resolution No. 4 (Series of 1962),
dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1962</st1:date>
is hereby set aside;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The appeal of the Junior-Party-
Applicant should be accordingly docketed as an <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">This interference case is hereby
suspended pending determination of the appeal; and</span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(4)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The Junior Party-Applicant is re­quired
to file its Brief in the appealed case within thirty (30) days from the date it
was docketed." (Annex Z attached to the Petition).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above-quoted order of
the respondent Director of Patents was based on the following considerations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"…<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>…<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>… that when the interference was
dissolved by the Chief Trade­mark Examiner, the Junior Party-Applicant
seasonably appealed.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal
however, was not properly docketed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Therefore, Rules 200 and 205 of the Rules of Practice in Tr<span style="">a</span>demark Cases should govern the
proceedings, wherein the Senior Party-Applicant <span style="">is </span><span style="">not a party, it being an <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> case
- a contest between the Chief Trademark Examiner end the Junior
Party-Applicant.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, the interference case should be suspended, pending
determination of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last
sentence, first paragraph, of Rule 183 <span style="">of
the Revised Rules of Practice provides that transmitting the motion to dissolve
for determination will act </span>as a stay of the interference proceedings
pending the determination of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issue of whether or not the interference was properly declared and
whether or not the Resolution of the Chief Trademark Examiner dissolving the
interference was proper <span style="">remains to be
finally resolved upon </span>the institution of the appeal." (Annex Z,
supra).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, petitioner filed the present petition for
certiorari, prohibition and mandamus, with <span style="">a prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, (1) to </span>set
aside the resolution of the Director of Patents of February 13, 1963; <span style="">(2) to order the dismissal of private
respondent's appeal; </span>(3) to declare the resolution of the Chief
Trademark Examiner <span class="GramE">dismissing</span> the interference, final
and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>, and finally, (4) <span style="">to restrain said officer from taking
cognizance of said appeal pending determination of the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's main
argument is </span>that, under Rule 203 of the Revised Rules of Practice in
Trademark Cases speci<span style="">fically providing
that appellant shall file his brief within sixty </span>days from date of
appeal (notice of appeal) and that upon its failure to do so, the appeal shall
stand dismissed, <span style="">the Director </span>of
Patents has no power to give due course to private respondent's appeal
mentioned heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present action for certiorari etc. arose because of wrong
procedural steps taken in the interference proceed<span style="">ing - </span><span style="">(INTER PARTES CASE
No. 194).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to the record,
on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="8"><span style="">August 11, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">,
the Chief Trademark Examiner declared <span class="GramE">an <u>interference</u></span>
between the trademarks of the petitioner and of the private respondent
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="8"><span style="">August 15, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, upon motion of </span>petitioner, said
Examiner dissolved the <u>interference</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this resolution, private respondent appealed to the Director of
Patents.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that notwithstanding the appeal, the
interference case was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1962</st1:date> apparently for the purpose of receiving
evidence bear­ing upon the alleged "confusing similarity" of the
trade­marks used by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
hearing, in our opinion, was uncalled for and unjustified, <span style="">in </span>view of
the fact that the interference had been dissolved and the order of dis­solution
was already the subject of an <span style="">appeal
timely taken to </span>the Director of Patents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the hearing set for January 25, 1962, the private
respondent filed a motion praying that it be allowed to file its appeal brief
within 30 days from the date the interference case would have been tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is far as the record discloses, this trial <span style="">has </span>not
been held to <span style="">this </span>date, nor has
private respondent's motion aforesaid been resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As a </span>matter of fact, the resolution attached
to the petition as Annex Z (Record p. 124) issued by the respondent Director of
Patents on February <span style="">13, 1963 orders the
suspension of </span>the proceedings in the interference case pending
determination of the appeal, declaring, at the same time, that, as the appeal
"was not properly docketed" the same should be "docketed as an
ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> case".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The </span>same resolution gives
the private respondent 30 days from the date his appeal <span style="">is </span>properly docketed within which to file its brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In as much as <span style="">the validity of said resolution is necessarily involved in this
proceedings, and private respondent's motion for an additional period for the
filing of its brief </span>has not been resolved to this date, We can not
escape the conclusion that, as a matter of fact, the period within which said
respondent was under obligation to file its brief has not yet started to run.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>also notice <span style="">that the </span>resolution
issued on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1962</st1:date> by
the respondent Director of Patents (attached to <span style="">the petition as Annex T) </span><span style="">sets
aside the action of the Chief Trademark Examiner granting the motion to
dissolve the interference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, We
believe, is not only contrary to the orderly procedure provided by law in cases
of this nature, </span><span style="">but it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">also extremely doubtful, to say the least, whether said respondent </span><span style="">had authority to do so under the
"general supervision" granted to him in the third paragraph of Rule
198 of the Revised Rules of Practice before his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being </span><span style="">a fact </span><span style="">that the
correctness of said order of </span>dissolution of the interference was
precisely the issue involved in the appeal pending before him, it seems clear
that the same could not be resolved except in the aforesaid appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing from the foregoing that (1) the Chief Trademark
Examiner of the Patent Office had jurisdiction to issue the order dissolving
the interference; (2) that his resolution in that connection had been
seasonably appealed to the respondent Director of Patents; and (3) that, as a
consequence, said respondent Director of Patents' resolution suspending
proceedings in the interference case, ordering the proper docketing of the
appeal interposed by herein private respondent and giving the latter a period
of thirty days from the date the appeal is docketed within which to file its
brief, <span style="">is </span>in accordance with law
and the procedure followed by his office in similar cases, the writs of
certiorari, prohibition and mandamus prayed for in the petition under
consideration are hereby denied, with costs, but without prejudice to the
appeal mentioned heretofore taking its due course.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</b> heretofore issued in
this case <span style="">is </span>hereby set aside.</p>
