the decision herein, filed by counsel for petitioners-</p>

<blockquote>&quot;One pitfall into which this Honorable Court has re­peatedly
fallen whenever the question as to whether or not a particular subject matter
is within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations is the tendency
of this Honorable Court to rely upon its own pronouncement without due regard
to the statutes which delineate the ju­risdiction of the industrial court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quite often, it is over­looked that no court,
not even this Honorable Court, is empowered to expand or contract through its
decision the scope of its jurisdictional authority as conferred by law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This error is manifested by the decisions of
this Honorable Court citing earlier rulings but without making any reference to
and analysis of the pertinent statute governing the jurisdiction of the Court
of Industrial Re­lations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
manifestation appears in this Honorable Court's decision in the instant
case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a result, the errors committed
in earlier cases dealing with the ju­risdiction of the industrial court are
perpetuated in subsequent cases involving the same issue.<span

contravened Rule 2, Section 5 of the Rules of Court when it applied the
so-called 'rule against split­ting of jurisdiction' in its Decision in the
present case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As applied by this
Honorable Court, the rule means that when an employee files with the Court of
Industrial Relations numerous claims relative to his employment but only one
[of] which <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is
</span>cognizable by said court under the law, while the others pertain to
other tribunals, that court has authority to entertain all the claims to avoid

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'><span class=GramE>drew</span> from the
Court an order directing counsel to show cause why they should not be dealt
with for contempt of court.</p>

<p class=BODY>In respondent attorneys' verified return, they offered
&quot;their most sincere apologies for the language used&quot; and stated that
&quot;[<span class=SpellE>i</span>]t was not and it has never been their
intention to be disrespectful.&quot; They manifested that the language
&quot;was the result of <span class=SpellE>overenthusiasm</span> on the part of
Atty. [Jose S.] <span class=SpellE>Armonio</span>, who thought best to focus
the attention of this Honorable Court to the issue in the case, and was not in
any <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>way meant </span>to slight or
offend this Honorable Court.&quot; They also said that the &quot;unfortunate
Motion for Reconsideration was prepared and filed by Atty. <span class=SpellE>Armonio</span>
who had been personally handling the case since its inception at the Court of
Industrial Relations, and who had, perhaps, become too emotionally involved in
the case.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent members of the law firm, namely, Attys. Alfonso Ponce <span
class=SpellE>Enrile</span>, Leonardo <span class=SpellE>Siguion</span> Reyna,
Manuel G. <span class=SpellE>Montecillo</span>, Enrique M. Belo and Oscar R. <span
class=SpellE>Ongsiako</span> assumed &quot;full responsibility&quot; for what
appears in the motion for reconsideration.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They submitted, not as an excuse, but as a fact, that not one of the
partners was able to pass upon the draft or final form of the said motion, and
that Atty. <span class=SpellE>Armonio</span>, an associate, pre­pared, signed
and filed the motion &quot;without clearing it with any of the part­ners of the
firm.&quot; The return winds up with an expression of deep regret about the
incident, coupled with an earnest pledge that it &quot;shall never hap­pen
again.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Subsequent to the return, respondent attorneys appeared in
court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Attys. Ponce <span class=SpellE>Enrile</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Armonio</span> were orally heard.</p>

<p class=NUM>1.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we look back at the
language (heretofore quoted) employed in the motion for reconsideration,
implications there are which inescapa­bly arrest attention.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It speaks of one pitfall into which this
Court has <u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>repeatedly fallen</span></u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> </span>whenever the jurisdiction of the
Court of Industrial Relations comes into question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That pitfall is the tendency of this Court to
rely on its own pronouncements <u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>in
disregard</span></u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> </span>of the law
on jurisdiction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It makes a sweeping
charge that the decisions of this Court <u>blindly adhere</u> to earlier
rulings without as much <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>as </span>making &quot;any reference to and analysis of&quot; the
pertinent statute governing the jurisdiction of the indus­trial court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plain import of all these <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span>that
this Court is so patent­ly inept that in determining the jurisdiction of the
industrial court; it has committed error and continuously repeated that error
to the point of perpetuation, It pictures this Court <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>as </span>one which refuses to hew to the
line drawn by the law on jurisdictional boundaries.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Implicit in the quoted statements is that the
pronouncements of this Court on the jurisdiction of the industrial court are
not entitled to respect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those
statements de­tract much from the dignity of and respect due this Court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They bring into question the capability of
the members - and some former members -of this Court to render justice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second paragraph quoted yields a tone of
sarcasm when counsel <span class=SpellE>labelled</span> <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>as </span>&quot;so-called&quot; the
&quot;rule against splitting of jurisdiction''.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'

<p class=BODY>By now, a lawyer's duties to the Court have become
commonplace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Really, there could hardly
be any valid excuse for lapses in the observance thereof.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of
Court, in categori­cal terms, spells out one such duty: &quot;To observe and
maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.&quot;
As explicit is the first canon of legal ethics which pronounces that [<span
class=SpellE>i</span>]t is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the
Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of
the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance.&quot;
That same canon, as a corollary, makes it peculiarly incumbent upon lawyers to
support the courts against &quot;unjust criticism and clamor.&quot; <span
class=GramE>And more.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
attorney's oath solemnly binds him to a conduct that should be &quot;with all
good fidelity <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>x <span class=SpellE>x</span>
<span class=SpellE>x</span> </span>to the courts.&quot; Worth remembering is
that the duty of an attorney to the courts &quot;can only be maintained by
rendering no service involving any disrespect to the ju­dicial office which he
is bound to uphold.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>We concede that a lawyer may think highly of his intellectual
endow­ment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is his privilege.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, he may suffer frustration at what he
feels is others' lack of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is his
misfortune.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some such frame of mind,
however, should not be allowed to harden into a belief that he may attack a
court's decision in words calculated to jettison the time-honored aphorism that
courts are the temples of right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
should give due allow­ance to the fact that judges are but men; and men are
encompassed by error, fettered by <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>fallibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=NUM>2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What we have before us
is not without precedent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Time and
again, this Court has admonished and punished, in varying degrees, members of
the Bar for statements, disrespectful or irreverent, acrimonious or defamatory,
of this Court or the lower courts.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Resort by an attorney - in a motion for reconsideration - to words which may
drag this Court down into disrepute, is frowned upon as &quot;neither justified
nor in the least necessary, because in order to call the attention of the court
in a special way to the essential points relied upon in his argument and to
emphasize the force thereof, the many reasons stated in the mo­tion&quot; are
&quot;sufficient&quot;, and such words &quot;superfluous.&quot;<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'> </span>It is in
this context that we must say that just because Atty. <span class=SpellE>Armonio</span>
&quot;thought best to focus the attention&quot; of this Court &quot;to the
issue in the case&quot; does not give him unbridled license in language.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To be sure, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>lawyers may </span>come up with various
methods, perhaps much more effective, in calling the Court's attention to the
issues involved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The language vehicle
does not run short of expressions, emphatic but respectful, convincing but not
derogatory, illuminating but not offensive.</p>

<p class=BODY>To be proscribed then is the use of unnecessary language which
jeopardizes high esteem in courts, creates or promotes distrust in judicial
administration, or which could have the effect of &quot;harboring and
encouraging discontent which, in many cases, is the source of disorder, thus
undermining the foundation upon which rests that bulwark called judi­cial power
to which those who are aggrieved turn for protection and relief.&quot;<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Stability of judicial institutions suggests that the Bar stand firm on this <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>precept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The language here in question, respondents aver, &quot;was the
result of <span class=SpellE>overenthusiasm</span>.&quot; It is but to repeat
an old idea when we say that enthusiasm, or even excess of it, is not really
bad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, the one or the other is no
less a virtue, if channeled in the right direction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, it must be circumscribed within the
bounds of propriety and with due regard for the proper place of courts in our
system of government.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>We are not unmindful of counsel's statement that the language
used &quot;was not in any <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>way </span>meant
to slight or offend&quot; this Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Want of intention, we feel constrained to say, is no excuse for the
language employed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For, counsel cannot escape
responsibility &quot;by claiming that his words did not mean what any reader
must have understood them as meaning.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7'
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
At best, it extenuates liability.</p>

<p class=NUM>3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We now turn to the
partners of the law firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They explained
that not one of them cleared the motion in which the questionable por­tion
appears.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their reason is that they were
not in the office at the time said motion was filed - which was the last
day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They added that <span class=GramE>&quot;
it</span> is the policy of the firm known to all its members and associates
that only the partners can sign court pleadings except in rare cases where, for
want of time or due to unexpected circumstances, an asso­ciate has to sign the
same&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We understood Atty. Alfonso
Ponce <span class=SpellE>Enrile</span> to have said in open court that in his
long years of practice, he knows that it serves no useful purpose to downgrade
the dignity of the Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We may
overlook the short comings of the members of the law firm; except that, as we
see it, partners are duty bound to provide for efficacious control of court
pleadings and other court papers that carry their names or the name of their
law firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seemingly, such control was
absent here.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the end, we admonish Atty. Jose S. <span class=SpellE>Armonio</span>,
with the warn­ing that repetition of this incident will be dealt with
accordingly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let a copy of this
resolution be attached to his record.</p>

<p class=BODY>Attention of Attys. Alfonso Ponce <span class=SpellE>Enrile</span>,
Leonardo <span class=SpellE>Siguion</span> Rey­na, Manuel G. <span
