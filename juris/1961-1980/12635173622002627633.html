				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Republic Act.</span> No. 5777, creating the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oppus</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, and approved on <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1969</st1:date>, provides in Section 3
that "the first mayor, vice-mayor and councilors of the municipality shall
be elected in the next general elections."</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 11, 1969 the Commission on Elections promulgated a
resolution, number RR-651, authorizing the holding of special elections,
simultaneously with the national elections on November 11, 1969, to fill the
posi­tions of local elective officials in nine (9) newly-created municipalities
in different provinces pursuant <span style="">to
Section </span>9 of the Decentralization Act of 1967 (R. A. No. 5185), which
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 9.</span> Filling of Elective Offices
in Newly Created Provinces, Cities, Municipalities or Municipal Districts<span class="GramE">.-</span> Elective offices in any new province, city, municipality
or municipal district shall be filled by regular or special election to
coincide with the next regular presidential or local election:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That if it is created within thirty
days before a regular presidential or local election, the said vacancies shall
be filled as hereinafter pro­vided in the next succeeding section."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The municipality of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oppus</span> was not
one of those enumerated in the aforesaid resolution, However, the Law Division
of the Commission on Elections, purportedly in conformity with the tenor
thereof, took steps for the election of the local officials of the said
municipality also on November 11, 1969, by ordering the printing of the
required ballots and election forms and sending the corresponding notices to
the provincial officials of Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> and the
other officials concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The steps
thus taken by the Law Division were confirmed by the Commission itself on <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime Hon. <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Yñiguez</span>, Congressman from Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
and sponsor of the bill which became Republic Act No. 5777, sent a letter to
the Commission on October 6, 1969, advising the latter that the intention of
said law was "for the municipal officials (of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oppus</span>)
to be elected during the regular local elections in 1971," and asking that
the election scheduled by the Commission be deferred accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was denied by the Commission in
the same session it held to confirm the action of its Law Division on <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1969</st1:date>, and a subsequent
motion for reconsideration by Congressman <span class="SpellE">Yñiguez</span> was
like­wise denied by resolution dated <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition for review, with an implied prayer that it
be considered as a special civil action for certiorari, prohibition and
mandamus, was filed by Congress­man <span class="SpellE">Yñiguez</span> on
October 28, 1969, alleging lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the
Commission on Elections and asking that its resolutions of October 14 and 21 be
declared null and void and that it be prohibited from call­ing or holding a
special election on November 11, 1969, for the positions of mayor, vice-mayor
and councilors <span style="">in </span>the newly-created municipality of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Oppus</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission filed its answer to the petition and the
case was heard by this Court on oral argument on <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1969</st1:date>, after which it was submitted for
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The focal point of our inquiry is the meaning and intent of
Section 3 of Republic Act No. 5777, which says that "the first mayor,
vice-mayor and councilors shall be elected in the <u><span style="">next general elections</span></u><span style="">."
</span>The stand of respondent Commission is that since the presidential elec­tion
on November 11, 1969, wherein the President, the Vice-President, eight of the
twenty-four Senators and all the Congressmen are to be chosen by the
electorate, is a general election, this is the one referred to in Republic Act
No. 5777, being "next" to its approval on June 21, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­liance is also placed by the Commission on
Section 9 of the Decentralization Act of 1967, which as already pointed out
provides that "elective offices in any new...municipality ...shall be
filled by regular or special elections to coin­cide with the next regular
presidential or local election."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our opinion that the foregoing interpretation is not
justified.</p>

the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

conclusion that <span style="">the term "next </span>general elections" used in the Act
necessarily means the very first general election <span style="">following the </span>enactment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The more reasonable interpretation is that the reference is to the
general election for local officials, since the offices to be filled are local
and not national in nature.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Respondent Commission itself has adopted the same
interpretation in another case of similar nature, concerning the election of
the provincial officials of <st1:place>Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
after its creation as a separate province (Case No. 369, Resolution promulgated
May 30, 1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission there
said:</p>

<blockquote>"'Regular election next following the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Act' used in Sec. 4 of Rep. Act No. 2227 refers to the regular election
for provincial and local officials.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Case: By virtue of Republic Act No. 2227, approved on <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1959</st1:date>, the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
was created; began its corporate existence as such on <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1960</st1:date>, with the appointment and
qualification of its provincial officials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 4 of Republic Act No. 2227 pro­vides that said officials 'shall
hold office until their successors shall have been elec­ted in the regular
election next following the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Act.'
The question now is whether or not election for <span style="">the </span>offices of provincial governor, vice-governor and members of
the provincial board of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
will be held on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1961</st1:date>,
simultaneously with the election for President, Vice-President, Senators, and
Congressmen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ruling: It is plain that the phrase 'regular election next
following the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Act' used in Sec. 4
of Republic Act No. 2227 refers to the regular election for provin­cial and
local officials which will be held in November, 1963, and not to the coming
regular election for national officials on November 14, 1961.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The phrase in question is also explained by the context of the law
taken as a whole wherein it is used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
Section 4 treats of provincial offices, and, therefore, when it speaks of
regular election to fill said offices, it can only refer to the regular
election for provincial offices, considering that the Re­vised Election Code,
in Section 7 thereof, entitled 'Regular elections for provincial, city,
municipal and municipal district offices,-‘ specifically provides for a
separate regular election for provincial offices distinct from that set in
Section 6 entitled 'Regular elections for national offices.’</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">4. In the course of the hearing of this petition counsel for
respondent Commission argued that <span style="">its ruling </span><span style="">in </span>the <st1:place>Southern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
case has no application <span style="">herein in view </span>of
the supervening enactment of the <span style="">Decentralization
</span>Act, particularly Section 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
do not <span style="">see that this Act </span>should
compel a different ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be
noted that Section <span style="">9 provides </span>for
two ways to fill <span style="">elective offices in </span>a
newly created municipality: by regular <span style="">or
special </span>election to coincide with the next regular <span style="">presidential </span><span style="">or </span>local election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously if the next regular <span style="">election is </span>a local one, there need be
no special election <span style="">to fill </span>such
offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election for that purpose <span style="">is considered </span>also
"regular." However, if the next regular <span style="">election is </span>presidential, then the election "to coincide"
with <span style="">it in </span>order to fill such
local offices necessarily has <span style="">to be </span><span style="">a </span>special
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Act No. 5777 does not provide
for, <span style="">and </span>evidently does not
contemplate, the holding of a special election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What it does say is that the first mayor, vice-mayor and councilors
shall be elected in the next <u>general</u> elections.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As may be observed, in
the above instances the Congress, while employing different phraseologies, has

proviso "to hold office until their successors shall have been elected in
the next general election for local officials." In the absence of similar
restrictive terms or provisions in Republic Act No. 5777 the logic of the
situation must prevail, that is, when it merely says "the next general
elections" it means the next general elections for the offices which are
to be filled, which will be held in 1971.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The spirit of the
