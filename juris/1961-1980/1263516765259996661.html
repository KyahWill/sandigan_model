PERFECTO R. PALACIO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAMARINES SUR AND DAMASO

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for a writ of certiorari to review and set aside an
order of respondent judge approving the appeal bond of respondent Damaso
Ferrer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 May 1966, Judge Palacio of the Court of First Instance of
Camarines Sur rendered his decision in Civil Case No. 5151, wherein petitioners
were plaintiffs and Damaso Ferrer the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties announced in due time their
intention to appeal from the decision to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While respondent Ferrer had filed his record
of appeal within the period prescribed by the rules, he admittedly failed to
file his appeal bond within the reglementary term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, the plaintiffs, now petitioners,
moved that Ferrer's appeal be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter objected on the ground that the appeal bond had been
notarized and readied, and the bond premium duly paid to the bonding company,
even prior to the expiration of the appeal period, but that said bond was not
timely filed in court due to oversight on the part of Luis Valencia, secre­tary
to the attorneys for Ferrer, Messrs. General &amp; General of Naga City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the objection was the secretary's
affidavit that while he received the bond on 30 June 1966, with instructions to
file it, it was not filed because -</p>

<blockquote>"I forgot to make the simple copy of
the bond in Civil Case No. 5151 and to serve and file it, specially when on
that weekend, I returned for a short visit to my hometown (Caramoan) to take
advantage of the holiday on 4 July (a Monday).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I only remembered the said appeal bond when Atty. General
found its two copies, in­cluding the original, in the files of the record of
said case on 21 July 1966.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In my more than two years of service in the law office of
Atty. General, this was the first instance where I overlook to file any
pleading." (Annex "A", Answer, Rec., page 11)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that the belated filing of the appeal bond
was due to excusable negligence, and denied the motion to dismiss defendant's
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs then recoursed to
this Court, claiming that the refusal to dismiss Ferrer's appeal was in grave
abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indisputable and elementary that to perfect an appeal the
notice and record of appeal, as well as the appeal bond, must be filed within
the period prescribed by the Rules; and that the failure to do so renders the
decision final and unappealable because the period for appeal is fatal (See, <u>inter
alia</u>, Alvero vs. De la Rosa, 76 Phil. 433; Salva vs. Palacio (1952), 90
Phil. 731; Reyes vs. Court of Appeals (1943), 74 Phil. 235; Mallare vs. Panahon
(1955), 98 Phil. 154).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the would be
appellant is not thereby precluded from seeking relief under Revised Rule 38,
section 2, whenever the entering of a judgment or order against said party was
made through fraud, accident, mistake or excusable neglect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court so indicated in Salve vs. Palacio
and Reyes vs. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Medran vs. Court of Appeals (1949), 83 Phil. 167, we said:</p>

<blockquote>"The order of the Court of First
Instance of Feb­ruary 19, 1946, dismissing the appeal was undoubtedly valid,
because the defeated parties had failed to submit an appeal bond in due
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The would be appellant could
obtain a revocation of that order, upon a motion for relief from acci­dent,
mistake or excusable negligence, pursuant to Rule 38</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if their petition for relief is
denied, they should appeal." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And, conformably to the foregoing ruling,
in Salva vs. Palacio (1952), 90 Phil. 732, this Court, after holding that a
dismissal of the appeal was proper because the appeal bond had been filed two
days after the expiry of the extension granted for the purpose, added however:</p>

<blockquote>"What the herein petitioner or his
counsel should have done in the Court below <u>was to file a motion for relief
under Rule 38,</u> and not to appeal from the judgment of the Court below . . .
. " (Cas. cit., page 734; emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now, if a party may seek relief under Rule 38, and within the
period prescribed therein, after an order for dismissal of the appeal has been
entered, <u>there is no reason for denying him that right before the order of
dismissal is entered</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Ferrer's objection to the motion to dismiss his appeal in this case was
virtually a motion for relief under Rule 38; it was predicated on accident or
excusable neglect, and was accompanied by an apposite affidavit of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was proper for the trial court to
grant him relief, provided of course the ground for doing so appeared
indubitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues are thus narrowed down to the question whether in the
granting of relief to the appellant Ferrer there was such "grave abuse of
discretion" to warrant intervention of this Court under section 1 of
Revised Rule 65.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Abad Santos vs. Province of Tarlac, 67 Phil. 480, it was ruled
that “grave abuse of discretion" implies such capricious and whimsical
exercise of judgment as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction; and again, in
Luna vs. Nable, 67 Phil. 340 and Alafriz vs. Nable, 72 Phil. 278, this Court
posited that to warrant certiorari the abuse of discretion must be so patent
and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty, or to a virtual refusal
to perform a duty enjoined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Concomitantly, Villa Rey Transit vs. Bello (1963) 7 SCRA, 735 (citing
Government vs. Judge of First Instance, 34 Phil. 157), reiterated that not
every erroneous con­clusion of law or of fact is abuse of discretion, for
certiorari can not take the place of an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court below in the case at bar predicated its grant of relief on the
diligence displayed by appellant Ferrer in procuring an appeal bond, paying the
requisite premium to the bonding company and readying the documents well ahead
of the expiration of the appeal period, so that the non-filing thereof in time
was due to accidental and unforeseeable, oversight of an employee who had
hitherto proved exact in the discharge of his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The undisputed existence of the basic facts
readily distinguishes the present case from that of Philippine Air Lines vs.
Arca, 19 SCRA 300, relied upon by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we are not prepared to say that the
action complained of in granting relief to appel­lant and denying the motion to
dismiss his appeal was totally devoid of foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court below undoubtedly maintained a
liberal attitude; but its action did not intrude into the realm of arbitrary or
capricious action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for is denied, with costs
against herein petitioners De Luna.</p>
