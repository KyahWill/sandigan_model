				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the Municipal Court (now City Court) of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the New Zealand Insurance Co., Ltd. sued the Manila Port Service and the Manila
Railroad Company for the recovery of a sum of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants were adjudged liable to the
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon elevation of the case to
the Court of First Instance, the said defendants were also held liable to the
plaintiff for the amount of P500, with interest thereon at the legal rate from <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1962</st1:date>, until fully paid, and
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied, the defendants
have brought the case to Us on questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts that gave rise to the suit appear in the Stipulation of
Facts entered into by the parties before the Court of First Instance,
substantial portions of which are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on or about June 4,
1961, the vessel S/S 'TENSEI MARU' took on board at Osaka, Japan, for shipment
to Manila consignment cargoes including eight (8) cases of plain irons Stanley <span class="SpellE">Patt</span> and slim taper in the name of J. R. De Santos and
Company, Inc. of Manila, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the consignee, J.
R. De Santos and Company, Inc. took from Plaintiff an insurance policy for ONE
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY ($1,530.00) DOLLARS, covering the said shipment
against all risks;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That vessel S/S 'TENSEI
MARU' arrived at the Port of Manila on June 16, 1961 and subsequently
discharged its cargoes including the eight (8) cases of plain irons Stanley <span class="SpellE">Patt</span> and slim taper into the custody of the Defendant,
Manila Port Service, the last package of which was discharged on June 16, 1961;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the shipping
documents covering said shipment were endorsed and transmitted to J. R. De
Santos &amp; Company, Inc. thru its custom's broker, F. N. <span class="SpellE">Sagmaquen</span>,
paid for the same, and being the owner thereof, cleared the documents through
the Defendant, Manila Port Service and Bureau of Customs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That of the aforementioned
shipment of eight (8) cases due for delivery to J. R. De Santos &amp; Company,
Inc. only seven (7) cases were actually and in fact delivered to J. R. De Santos
&amp; Company, Inc. thru its customs broker on July 7, 1961 under Gate Pass No.
5508, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“11. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>That the shipment of
eight (8) cases was discharged complete and in good order and condition by
Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. into the custody of the Defendant, Manila Port
Serv­ice, and that loss of one (1) case occasioned while the same was in the
possession and custody of defendant, Manila Port Service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> fees of the ship­ment in question were paid on the
basis of weight or measurement and not on the value thereof since its value was
not manifested nor indicated in the Bill of Lading (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A) or otherwise specified;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That by reason of said
loss, Plain­tiff as insurer, paid to the consignee J. R. De Santos &amp;
Company, Inc., the amount of ONE THOUSAND AND EIGHT-TWO PESOS &amp; 44/100
(P1,082.44), representing its liability under the insurance contract, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Plaintiff and/or
J. R. De Santos &amp; Company, Inc. the former having been subrogated to the
rights of the latter by virtue of the pay­ment mentioned in the preceding
paragraph im­mediately filed a formal claim in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED
FORTY-FOUR &amp; 86/100 (P544.86) Pesos, representing the value of the lost
shipment, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the broker F. N. <span class="SpellE">Sagmaquen</span>, for and in behalf of consignee J. R. De Santos,
filed a provisional written claim with the Ma­nila Port Service on July 12,
1961, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the parties agree
that the only issues to be resolved by this Honorable Court are:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a) Whether Section 15 of the Management Con­tract before-mentioned
is applicable to the in­stant case and if so, whether consignees or its
representative filed the claim as required under Sec. 15 of the
before-mentioned Management Con­tract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"3");</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) In the event defendants are liable, what is the extent of their
liability excluding attor­ney's fees, if any, that may be granted by this
Honorable Court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) Whether or not attorney's fees as claimed by plaintiff in the
complaint should be granted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the defendants claim that it was a mistake for
the lower court not to have declared them relieved and released of any responsibility
for the loss of the goods in question due to the failure of the plain­tiffs to
file their claim <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> within fifteen (15) days
from June 16, 1961, the date of the discharge of the last package from the
carrying vessel, pursuant to Section 15 of the Management Contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule, really, is that the claim of the consignee or
its <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> for loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span>
and/or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> of goods, must be presented to the
contractor within fifteen days from the date of dis­charge of the last package
from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This applies
where, ordinarily, the consignee or claimant has knowledge of the loss, damage,
<span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> and/or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span>
before the expiration of said fifteen-day period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule, however, is different in instances where the claimant
comes to learn of the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span>
and/or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> only after the fifteen-day
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, the rule to
follow, as stated in <u>Insurance Company of North America v. Maritime Company
of the Philippines, et al., etc</u>., G. R. No. L-22534, <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1966</st1:date>, is that applied in <u>Yu <span class="SpellE">Kimteng</span> Construction Corp. v. Manila Port Service</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
G. R. No. L-17027, <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1965</st1:date>,
that is, the period of fifteen days within which a claim should be filed should
commence, not from the date of discharge of the goods from the carrying vessel,
but from the date the consignee or claimant learns of the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> and/or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span>
for which the claim is made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
because the consignee is in no position to allege such loss, etc. before he
comes to know about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before delivery,
the goods are in the care and custody of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contractor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, while the last package was discharged from
the carrying vessel on June 16, 1960, the consignee took delivery of the cargo
on July 7, 1960 and it was only then that it learned that one case of its goods
was missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It filed its claim only
five (5) days there­after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A literal
application of the provision of paragraph 15 of the Management Contract,
therefore, would not serve its purpose in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thus agree with the trial judge that the
claim was not filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in Yu <span class="SpellE">Kimteng</span> Construction
Corporation v. Manila Port Service, <u>supra</u>, with a strict adherence to
the provision of Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract, all the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contractor would have to do in order to escape
liability is to withhold knowledge of the loss from the consignee until after the
expiration of fifteen days - a situation unfair to the consignee.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not reviewing the finding of the lower court as to the
amount to be recovered as this has not been questioned before Us.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed
in <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Costs against the defendants-appellants.</p>
