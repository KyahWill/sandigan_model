				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal on questions of <span style="">law </span>from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila in its <span style="">Civil </span>Case
No. 21808 entitled "United Insurance Company, Inc., Plaintiff, versus
Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines and/or Manila Port Service
and/or Manila Railroad Company, Defendants."</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff is the insurer of a shipment of 3,768 cases of
corned <span style="">beef </span>consigned to the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Commercial of Manila, loaded on the S/S "<span class="SpellE">Straat</span> Van <span class="SpellE">Diemen</span>," a vessel
owned and operated by defendant Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said vessel arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="10">October <span style="">4, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>and the said cargo was discharged
unto the cus<span style="">tody of the Manila Port
Service which also delivered the same to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon delivery, however, the cargo was found
short of sixty-six (66) cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claims
were filed by the broker with the <span style="">Manila
</span>Port <span style="">Service, </span>the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, followed by formal claims with the
carrying vessel and the plaintiff insurance company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The value of the loss was paid by the
plaintiff to the consignee and the former was thereby subrogated to the rights
of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the <span style="">plaintiff filed </span>with the Court of
First Instance a complaint against the Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, the Manila Port Service and the Manila Railroad Company as alternative
defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, the defendant carrier <span style="">denied </span>liability by claiming that the cargo in question was
completely discharged to the custody of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator, and interposed a counterclaim for damages representing attorney's <span style="">fees </span><span style="">against the plaintiff which, according to said
de­</span><span style="">fendant, acted with gross and
<span style="">evident bad </span>faith, thereby
compelling it to hire the <span style="">services </span>of
<span style="">counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, on the
other hand, disclaimed having received the missing cases from the carrying
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As special defense, it averred
that since no claim for value was filed by the consignee or its representative
within fifteen days from the date of discharge of the last package from the
carrying vessel, the claim had become time-barred and/or had prescribed
pursuant to the Management Contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court found from the evidence that the en­tire cargo of
3,768 <span style="">cases </span>of corned beef were
delivered to the Manila Port Service but, <span style="">as </span>already stated, the latter failed to deliver 66 cases to the
consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, together with its mother com­pany, was
held <span style="">liable </span>for $1,118.32, or
P3,371.43, the value of the missing <span style="">cases
</span>and the actual amount paid by plaintiff to the consignee under the
insurance policy covering the shipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having been adjudged liable, the Manila Port Service and the
Manila Railroad Company have appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the first time in this appeal, they dispute the jurisdiction of the
trial court over the subject matter of the action <span style="">as </span>to them considering that, while plaintiff's cause of action
against their co-defendant, Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, <span style="">is for breach of contract of carriage or <span class="SpellE">affreightment</span> (therefore, involving maritime admiralty
matters), the cause against them </span><span style="">as </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">arrastre</span></span><span style=""> operator is for the short delivery of the cargo valued at only
P3,371.43, which is less than the minimum amount falling under the jurisdiction
of that court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Among other things, the complaint alleges that -</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> the loss occurred while defendant carrier
had custody of the cargo and failed to discharge the same or, after discharge
of the cargo, while defendant port service had custody of the goods, in either
of which case, there was violation of the duty properly to safely carry and
discharge the goods on the port of <span style="">the
carrier or, in the alternative, to make de­</span>livery of the goods on the
part of defendant port service after discharge." (Paragraph 9)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This allegation simply shows that during
the filing of the complaint, the <span style="">plaintiff
</span>was yet uncertain <span style="">as </span>to whose custody the goods were under when the <span style="">loss </span>took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it had to join both the shipping
company and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator <span style="">as </span>alternative
defendants, pursuant to Section 13 of Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, to <span style="">wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Alternative defendants</u>. - Where the plaintiff is
uncertain against which of several per­sons he <span style="">is entitled to relief, </span>he may join any or all of them <span style="">as </span>defendants
in the <span style="">alternative, </span>although a
right to relief against one may be inconsistent with a right to relief against
the other."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Such a <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of parties is also sanctioned by the first paragraph of Section 5, Rule 2 of
the same <span style="">Rules, </span>which says:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE"><u>Joinder</u></span><u> of causes of
action</u>. - Subject to rules regarding jurisdiction, venue and <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties, a party may in one pleading state, in
the alternative or otherwise, as many causes of action <span style="">as </span>he may have against an opposing
party <span style="">(a) </span>if
the <span style="">said
causes </span>of action arise out of the same contract, transaction or relation
between the parties, or (b) if the cause of ac<span style="">tion for demands for money, or are of the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">nature and character."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the second paragraph of the same section, "in
the cases falling under clause (a) the action shall be filed in the inferior
court unless <span style="">any </span>of the causes
joined falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance in which <span style="">case </span>it shall be filed in the latter <span style="">court."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that one of the causes of action <span style="">as </span>found in the complaint - that of
admiralty against the Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines - is
cognizable by the Court of First Instance.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Notwithstanding, therefore, that the
other <span style="">cause </span>of action would
fall within the jurisdiction of the municipal and/or city court by reason of
the amount involved,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">the </span><span style="">case was </span><span style="">correctly filed
with the Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the first time that this issue is brought before us
for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="">Switzerland</span></u></st1:place></st1:country-region><u><span style=""> General Insurance </span></u><st1:place><u><span style="">Co.</span></u></st1:place><u><span style="">, Ltd. v. </span></u><u><span style="">Java Pacific </span></u><u><span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Hoegh</span> Lines and
the </span></u><st1:place><u><span style="">Manila</span></u></st1:place><u><span style=""> Railroad Company</span></u><span style="">, G. </span><span style="">R. No. L-</span><span style="">21760, promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April </span><span style="">30,
 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, this court,
citing same section 5 of Rule 2, stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As may be seen, the instant case comes within the purview of
the rule <span class="SpellE"><span style="">abovequoted</span></span><span style=""> </span>for therein it is postulated that <span style="">a </span>party may
in one pleading state in the alternative as many causes of action as he may
have against an opposing party if they arise from the same transaction with the
<span style="">particular</span>ity
that the case may be filed in the court of first instance <span style="">if any </span>of said
causes of action falls within its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is precisely what <span style="">was </span>done in this particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the uncertainty of the place where
the disappearance of the shipment occurred, plaintiff brought the case in the
alternative before the court of first instance upon the theory that it may have
occurred while the shipment was in transit or while in the custody of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the other contention of the appellants that the action is
time-barred since no <span style="">claim </span>for
value was filed within fifteen days from the date of discharge of the goods,
pursuant to section 15 of the Management Contract, the record shows that
provisional claim for said goods was filed with the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator on October 8, 1961, barely three days after the discharge of the last
cargo from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
been settled that filing of a mere provisional claim within the prescribed 15-day
period <span style="">is </span>sufficient
compliance with the requirement.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finding no reversible error in the decision under appeal, the
same is hereby affirmed, without pronouncement <span style="">as </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
