				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental in Sp. Proc. No. 337, denying the
petition of <span class="SpellE">Sinforosa</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Millen­dez</span> for the
adoption of her grandchildren, by reason of her disqualification under Article
335 of the new Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="2"><span class="GramE">15 February 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, <span class="SpellE">Sinforosa</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span> petitioned the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental for
adoption of minors Francis <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>, Alex <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>, Maria Teresa <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>,
Joseph <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>, Greg <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>
and German <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was alleged in the petition that the minors were the children of her
only son, Bobby <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>, who had abandoned them for
over three years; that petitioner's <span style="">said
son had been with bad company and did not have the welfare and future of the
children at heart; that her said son in fact was disinherited by his father
(petitioner's deceased husband) in his will,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which will was duly probated by the court on
1 February </span>1965; that petitioner cherished and loved the minors as her
own children and the adoption was prompted by her sincere desire to protect
their welfare; that the minors' natural mother, Hannah A. <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>,
had consented to the petition; and that petitioner was financially capable of
making the adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was
published, and heard by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="7">10 July
 1967</st1:date>, the court denied the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was ruled that while the adoption would
benefit the minors, the same can not be granted on account of the express
prohibition of Article 335 of the new Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner having a child - Bobby <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>, the father of the minors - she is disqualified
under the law to adopt anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, the court pointed out, the purpose of the minors' mother and grandmother
can still be achieved by the latter's executing a will, or having Bobby <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span> declared a spendthrift.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner thus appealed to this Court, contending that the
circums­tances of this case warrant a liberal interpretation of Article 335 of
the new Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Civil Code expressly
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ART. 335.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following cannot adopt:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) Those <span class="GramE">who</span> have legitimate, legiti­mated, acknowledged natural
children, or na­tural children by legal fiction;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question, in view of the explicit provision of
the law, that petitioner-appellant having already a legitimate child, Bobby <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>, is disqualified to adopt anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In urging the removal of this case from the
legal prohibition, however, appellant points to the facts that her son has been
prodigal and has not provided her with filial love and respect; that he was
even disinherited by her husband, his own father, for having attempted on the
latter's life; that her said son, Bobby <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span>,
had allegedly consented to the proposed adoption of his own children by herein
appellant; that it is appellant's love for her grandchildren and her fear that
Bobby <span class="SpellE">Millendez</span> would just dis­sipate whatever
properties he might inherit from her, leaving nothing to the said children,
that prompted this petition for adoption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, maintained that with the foregoing facts, it would be
pre­cisely in pursuance of the purpose of adoption statutes - which is the
promotion of the welfare of the children - that the present petition for
adoption should be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Adoption, as a privilege granted by law, can be exercised by any
person of age and in full possession of his civil rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, however, withdrawn from certain persons enumerated in Article 335 of the
Civil Code, among <span class="GramE">whom</span> are those who have children of
their own, whether the children are legitimate, legitimated or
illegitimate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the provision, being
clear and explicit, had to be enforced although its suspension or waiver would
have worked to the benefit or well-being of the child proposed to be
adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in one case, where after
the child was taken from his natural parents the adopting couple begot children
of their own, a petition subsequently filed to make formal the adoption of the
child was denied, on the ground that the adopters were already disqualified
because of the presence of their own children.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It is for the same reason that the petition of a step-father to adopt his
wife's child had by a previous marriage was refused, because there were already
children of that second marriage.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
For, while it is true that the intendment of adoption statutes is the promotion
of the welfare of the children, such that the modern trend is to encourage
adoption<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
by persons who can provide them with proper care and education,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
adoption may be allowed only where it is possible without doing violence to the
terms of the statute.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is of no significance in this case that appellant's child has
consented to the adoption, or that such child has become wayward and led a
dishonorable life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 335 of the
Civil Code creates a disqualification on the adopter himself, not on the child,
that there is nothing about the <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of the
latter short of his losing the status of a child (if there is any such means in
the law) that would remove the disqualification prescribed in the article.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the prohibition to adopt under Article 335 <span style="">(1) of </span>the Civil Code is not difficult
to find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only would the adoption
introduce a foreign conflicting element into the family unit, but it would, in
the present case, result in the reduction of the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
of the son to the benefit of the prospective <span class="SpellE">adoptees</span>,
who are not forced heirs of the would-be adopter, thereby producing an indirect
disinheritance in a manner not authorized by law,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
i.e., by a testament expressly stating the legal cause for the
disinheritance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only this, but the
adoption would make the disinheritance of the son permanent and irrevocable,
contrary to the policy of the law that "a subsequent reconciliation between
the offender and the offended person deprives the latter of the right to
disinherit and renders in­effectual any disinheritance that may have been
made".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
This same policy inspires Article <span class="GramE">1033, that</span> permits
an unworthy heir to succeed if the <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>cujus</u></span>
should condone the unworthiness in writing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The consent of the son to the adoption of his own children by his mother
is likewise ineffective to circumvent the statutory bar, as by Article 905, of
the Civil Code, every renunciation of a future <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
<span style="">is </span>void, and of no effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's claim that no disqualification attaches to her having
one legitimate child because Article 335 speaks of "children", is
equally devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of the
word "children" in the law does not mean that an adopter must have
more than one legitimate, legitimated or illegitimate child before the
disqualification to adopt shall attach.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No such intention can be discerned from the provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of the word "children", instead
of "child", appears more to have been called for by grammatical
correctness than anything else, to complement the plural subject
"those".</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no error in the <span style="">order appealed </span>from, the dismissal of the petition is affirmed,
with costs against the appellant.</p>
