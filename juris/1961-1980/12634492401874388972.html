				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila,
dismissing the complaint in Civil Case No. 57118 of said court as against the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1964</st1:date>,
the American Insurance Company filed a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>
&amp; Co., Inc. and the Bureau of Customs, <span style="">as alternative </span>defendants, for the <span style="">recovery of a sum
of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its answer, the Bureau of
Customs prayed for the dismissal of the case, one of its defenses being that
"it is not a juridical entity endowed with capacity to sue or be <span class="GramE">sued,</span> in any case, it cannot be sued without its
consent."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1964</st1:date>,
the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, this time including the Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action <span style="">is </span>for the collection of a sum of
money representing an unsatisfied claim for loss and non-delivery of goods
consigned to an importer who was subrogated by the plaintiff <span style="">as </span>insurer, upon payment by the
latter of the loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged that
the goods were loaded on board certain vessels at New York, U.S.A., of which
vessels <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., Inc. was the agent in
the Philippines, and upon arrival of the goods in Manila, the defendants
"either failed to discharge all the cargoes completely or having
discharged the same completely thereafter failed to take the <span class="SpellE">tran­shipment</span> of the cargoes, resulting in their loss and
non-­delivery" to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The participation of the Bureau of Customs in the transaction, as
alleged in para­graph 4 of the complaint, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"4<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That</span> since November 21, 1962, defendant Bureau has been operating
the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the port of Manila through
its division known as Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service
created for the purpose, charged with the duty of receiving imported cargoes
discharged from ocean carriers and safe­keeping and in due course delivering
the same to the owners thereof or to such other parties as are entitled to
delivery thereof, upon such deli­very being duly approved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The claim for the loss was duly filed against the defendants, <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., Inc. and the Bureau of Customs which,
according to plaintiff, refused and failed to pay the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 24, 1964, the Republic of the Philippines and the
Bureau of Customs, through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, on
the ground that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
action as to them, as operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service, the amount <span style="">involved being less than P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, falling
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the City Court of Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the consideration of the motion and the opposition thereto,
the lower court dismissed the <span style="">case </span>with
respect to the Government and the Bureau of Customs upon the ground set forth
in their motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">As above stated, the plaintiff appealed from this order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question raised in appellant’s brief is whether a money claim
of less than <span style="">P</span>10,000.00, which
allegedly arose from the failure of the Bureau of Customs in its <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, may be joined with a subject matter involving
admiralty in one suit, filed in the Court of First Instance against alternative
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not <span style="">a </span>novel question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a string of cases, this Court has ruled in
the affirmative where the money claim and the admiralty aspect of the suit arose,
as in the present case, out of one and the same transaction.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 10 of the complaint discloses that at the time the case
was instituted, plaintiff was not cer­tain as to when and in whose custody the
goods were lost, hence, the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of alternative
parties and causes of action, which <span style="">is
</span>sanctioned by the following provisions of the Rules of Court</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<span class="SpellE"><u>Joinder</u></span><u>
of causes of action</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Subject to rules regarding jurisdiction, venue and <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of parties, a party may in one pleading state, in the alternative or otherwise,
as many causes of action as he may have against an opposing <span style="font-size: 12pt;">party
(a) </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">if </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the said causes of action
arise out of the same contract, trans­action or relation between the parties,
or (b) if the cause of action are for demands for money, or are of the same
nature and character.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the cases falling under clause (a) of the preceding para­graph,
the action shall be filed in the interior court unless any of the causes joined
falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, in which case it
shall be filed in the latter court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 5, Rule 2, Rules of Court.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Alternative Defendants</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Where the plaintiff is uncertain against
which of several persons he is en­titled to relief, he may join any or all of
them as defendants in the alternative, although a right to re­lief against one
may be inconsistent with a right to relief against the other."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 13, Rule 3, Rules of Court.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Applying these rules, this Court in the case of
Switzerland General Insurance Co., Ltd. v. Java Pacific and <span class="SpellE">Hoegh</span>
Lines and the Manila Railroad, G.R. No.</span> L-21760, <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1966</st1:date>, stated:</p>

<blockquote>"As may be seen, the instant case comes within the purview of
the rule above quoted for therein it is postu­lated that a party may in one
plead­ing state in the alternative as many causes of action as he may have
against an opposing party <span style="">if </span>they arise from the same transaction with the particularity
that the case may be filed in the Court of First In­stance if any of said cause
of action falls within its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <span style="">is
</span>precisely what was done in this particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the uncertainty of the place where
the dis­appearance of the shipment occurred, plaintiff brought the case in the
al­ternative before the Court of First Instance upon the theory that it may
have occurred while the shipment was in transit or while in the custody of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the allegations in the complaint, it appears that the causes
of action against the alternative de­fendants arose out of the same
transactions and/or con­tracts, and one of the causes of action - that of admi­ralty
against the <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., Inc. - falls within
the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance <span style="">[Sec. </span>44 (d), Republic Act 296, as amended].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the said court has jurisdiction
to try the case in its en­tirety.</p>

<p class="BODY">But a matter of transcendental importance remains to be
considered in view of the lack of any allegation in the complaint that the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has given its consent to be sued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
it <span style="">is </span>true
that the absence of such an allegation is not one of the in­stances in which
the court <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">proprio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>may dismiss the complaint, and
although it was not relied upon by the Republic in its motion to dismiss, since
it inherently vitiates the complaint and <span style="">as </span>it may be passed upon at any stage of the
proceedings, we believe it is within out power to determine at this instance,
the effect of the absence of such an allegation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Non-suability of the State without its consent <span style="">is </span>one of
the basic principles which underlie our repub­lican form of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It derives its force from the will of the
people in freely creating a representa­tive government through which they have
agreed to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the sover­eignty for
the common good and general welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Metran</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, L-1232,
January 12, 1948) Justice Holmes has aptly stated the basis for the principle
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A sovereign is exempt from
suit, not because of any for­mal conception or obsolete theory, but on the
legal and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the
authority that makes the law on which the right depends." (<span class="SpellE">Kawananakao</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Poyblank</span>, 206 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
349) A contrary principle would dissipate the time and energy of the State in
endless suits against it, which would be subversive of the public interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the duty of a party attempting to show liability on the
part of the Government to allege in the complaint, as basis of the cause of
action, that the Republic of the Philippines has consented to be sued, either
by special law covering special subject matter or by general law expressing the
terms on which such consent <span style="">is </span>given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
allegation <span style="">is
</span>essential to create a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> cause of
action against the Government, without which the complaint suffers from a <span style="">fatal defect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, no such allegation was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case against the Republic may therefore
be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the Bureau of
Customs is but a finger of the Department of Finance, with no person­ality of
its own apart from that of the national Government (Mobil Philippines
Exploration, Inc. vs. Bureau of Customs and <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, L-23139, December 17, 1966), the complaint as against it may also be
dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Upon the foregoing considerations</b>, the complaint as
against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Bureau of Customs is hereby dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>
