petitioner Maria <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, who admittedly was a

execution having been issued because of their refusal to vacate as a result of
which they were given two (2) months within which <span style="">petitioner <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>
was required "to remove her house </span><span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,"
such order having been received as far back as May 30, 1964, and such "two

revoking the permit of the aforesaid Ramona Reyes "to possess a foreshore

and that she thereafter filed an application with the Bureau of Lands in her
own name, the matter having thereafter been elevated to the Department of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, which on March 29, 1961, ordered that such
"foreshore area in dispute be opened to public bidding in accordance with
the provisions of Lands Administrative Order No. 7-I, dated April 3,

Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Cesar M. <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It revealed that petitioner could not allege any

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since
the inherent defect of the petition was rather obvious and self-evident, it is
understandable why this Court issued this Resolution of October 27, 1964:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After a study of the allegations of the
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>, with a
prayer for preliminary injunction in L-23702 (Maria <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A
motion for reconsideration was filed however, alleging that there could not be

 18, 1960</st1:date>, and respondent Arturo Reyes, presumably her heir, did not
seek execution of such judgment until after almost four years from the time it
was affirmed by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a recon<span style="">sideration by </span>this Court of the
dismissal in <span style="">a
</span><span style="">Resolution </span>of <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1964</st1:date>, requiring
respondents to answer the petition and issuing the preliminary injunction
prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of respondent Arturo Reyes was filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the petition, according to
him, "is to question the legality of the order of respondent Judge dated

in favor of Ramona Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had been
paying to <span style="">the aforementioned Bureau the
permit fees in connection with </span>RPA Permit No. 5260.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Cooperative
Store (SACOS) and Maria <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, petitioners
herein, <span style="">were able </span>to obtain
their original possession of the said premises by virtue of a verbal contract
with Ramona Reyes to occupy <span style="">the same on
</span><span style="">a </span><span style="">lease
</span>of month to <span style="">month basis </span>at
the rate of P50.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner had been
paying rentals up to 2 or 3 months before the fire which <span style="">razed </span><span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>
on <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1957</st1:date>, which fire
also burned down the building of <span style="">SACOS </span>managed
<span style="">by </span>petitioner and which were
built on <span style="">the premises </span>in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the fire, Ramona Reyes
prevented petitioner from constructing a building in the said premises but
petitioner insisted in constructing a temporary shed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="6">June
 24, 1957</st1:date>, a formal demand to vacate the land in question was made
by Ramona Reyes to the petitioner, but petitioner did not heed this
demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The demand was made by Ramona
Reyes because she was about to construct thereon her own building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="26" month="4">April

 16, 1957</st1:date>, Ramona Reyes instituted an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceeding against SACOS and petitioner, and the case was decided by the
Justice of the <span style="">Peace of </span><span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span> in favor of Ramona Reyes."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above narration of facts was supplemented by the allegation
that on January <span style="">3, </span>1959, the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> rendered <span style="">a </span>decision
in such Civil Case No. 4694 declaring Ramona Reyes to be the <span style="">lawful possessor </span>of
the parcel of foreshore land in question and condemning petitioner to vacate, <span style="">a </span>decision
affirmed <span style="">by </span>this Court on <span style="">May 30, 1961 as
already </span><span style="">noted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The opinion of Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>
</span>in rejecting the untenable claim of petitioner was quite emphatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Indeed one of the <span style="">conclusive pre</span>sumptions prohibits the tenant
from denying the <span style="">title </span>of his landlord at the time of the commencement of the
relation of landlord and tenant between them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The
defendants here would </span>claim that plaintiff <u>had no </u><u><span style="">ri</span>ght to
sublease</u> to them this parcel of land when, sometime in 1957, they agreed
verbally to take it at P50.00 a month<span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rest
this denial on</span> the alleged cancellation of her lease permit in April,
1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as <span style="">the </span>law says, the <span style="">lessee may not deny </span>the title of his or her<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">lessor</span> * *
*, these defendants may not <u>now assert that in 1957</u> plaintiff <u>had no </u><u><span style="">title</span></u><span style=""> or right to </span>lease
such foreshore land <span style="">to </span>them." <span style="">The then Chief Justice </span><span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>
concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">"This view </span>of the <span style="">case makes </span>it
unnecessary to discuss the question whether the <span style="">dispute </span>should be presented before the
Bureau of Lands or Department of Agriculture.”</p>

to the order of </span>respondent Judge, had <span style="">demolished all constructions of peti­tioner

The issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction <span style="">was </span>sought, but this Court did not
oblige.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The additional ground for
</span><i style=""><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> alleged in the amended </span>petition was
traversed in an answer by respondent Arturo Reyes filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Respondent denies the
allegations in paragraph 21 of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that respondent Arturo Reyes has <span style="">effected </span>the
demolition of the constructions of petitioners on the land in <span style="">question, </span>the
same was made in good faith and pursuant to the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the claim of petitioner that respondent Reyes rushed the
demolition upon being informed of the present petition, in spite of the fact
that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> S. Marquez, the Clerk of this
Honorable Tribunal wired the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
petition, respondent Reyes started the demolition of the building of petitioner
in accordance with the order of respondent Judge dated August <span style="">17, </span>1964,
upon learning that this Honorable Tribunal, in <span style="">a </span>resolution dated October <span style="">27, 1964 dismissed the original petition for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The </span><span style="">demolition started </span>after <span style="">said order of </span>dismissal and <span style="">was </span>completed

respondent Provincial Sheriff acted on the basis of the <span style="">aforesaid dismissal, </span>the claim of <span style="">petitioner </span>that

breaches of the peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A judgment</span>

ordering restitution <span style="">of a parcel </span>of

manner, </span>can never be prejudicial interference with the disposition or
alienation of public lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, <span style="">if
</span>courts were deprived of jurisdiction over the cases involving conflicts
of possession, the threat of judicial action against breaches of the peace
committed on public lands would <span style="">be eliminated, </span>and <span style="">a state </span>of lawlessness would probably
be produced <span style="">bet­</span>ween
