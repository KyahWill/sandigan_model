Seriña, then Municipal Mayor of Kibawe, Bukidnon, and a candidate for
reelection to the same position in the November 14, 1967 election, prayed for
the set­</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">ting aside of an order of the
respondent Court of First Instance of </span>Bukidnon, the Hon. Abundio Z.
Arrieta presiding, dated December <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">14, 1967,
denying his motion to permit the Municipal Treasurer to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">open the ballot box of Precinct No. 20 of Kibawe,
Bukidnon for the sole purpose of retrieving the ballot box copy therein
contained, as </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">well as another order
of respondent court of December 19, 1967, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">directing the Municipal Board of Canvassers to proceed with the </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">canvass of the votes in such precinct without
requiring such Board </span>of Inspectors to fill up omissions of certain data
in both the Com­mission of Elections as well as the Municipal Treasurer's
copies of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">election returns as required by
Section 162 of the Revised Election </span>Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged in the petition:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"As the Municipal Board of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">Canvassers
of Kibawe, Bukidnon <span style="">were </span>about
to convene to canvass </span>the results of the elections for the different
municipal offices of Kibawe, Bukidnon, petitioner received a report that the
election returns of Precinct No. 20 of Kibawe was tampered with, altered and
falsified particularly the copies thereof which correspond to the Provincial
Treasurer, Municipal Treasurer and the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Petitioner filed with respondent
Court a petition for the judicial recount of the ballots in Precinct No. 20 of
Kibawe.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">More particularly, it <span style="">was </span>noted that according to the copy
for </span>the Commission on Elections, the other respondent, Ernesto Villalon,
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">likewise a candidate for municipal mayor,
received 525 votes while </span>in the copy for the Municipal Treasurer, the

<p class="BODY">As noted earlier, respondent court denied petitioner's urgent
motion to permit Municipal Treasurer of Kibawe, Bukidnon to retrieve election
returns contained in the ballot box of Precinct No. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">20 and granted a motion of respondent Villalon to proceed with the </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">canvass of votes in such precinct without first

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">This Court, in a resolution of
January 16, 1968, gave due course </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">to

10 days to submit a memorandum, the same period being granted respondents
within which to submit a reply memorandum, </span>if they so desire.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">An answer, dated February 2,
1968, was filed by respondent </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">Villalon,
where he admitted some of the allegations contained in </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">the petition, but stated "that on January
17, 1968, the ballot box in </span>question (for Precinct No. 20) was opened in
the Court of First <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">Instance of Bukidnon,
before the respondent Presiding Judge and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">the lawyers and representatives of both parties, and on January 19, </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">1968, when the election returns in question was
retrieved inside </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.25pt;">the ballot box for
Precinct No. 20, a comparison was made with </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">the two (2) other authentic copies of the election returns, namely, </span>The
Municipal Treasurer's Copy and the <span style="">Commission
on Elections </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">Copy as mentioned above,
and the same showed a [uniformity of </span>votes], to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE, (525) votes, in <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">words and figures, for your respondent Villalon; *

directing the Municipal board of Canvassers to observe and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">comply with Section 150 of the Revised Election
Code as to the </span>alleged omissions, respondent Villalon prayed for the
dismissal of the petition "for the reason that the issues raised in the
present <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">petition had already been rendered
moot and academic, and for </span>utter lack of merit * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">Subsequently, in a pleading
dated February 7, 1968 and filed </span>with this Court the next day,
respondent Villalon filed a motion to dismiss, reiterating that the issues
raised in this petition had become <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">moot and
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">anew </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">that even before the filing </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">of the petition, the act sought to be enjoined and

the sole purpose of retrieving the ballot box copy of the election returns,

centering "on the question as to whether the res­</span>pondent Court
correctly considered that the matter of the omitted in­formation in the

respondents </span></span><span style="">a period of
10 days from notice <span style="">within which to

came a <span style="">motion for reconsideration,

that under such circum­<span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">stances there should
not be on the part of the judiciary timidity and </span>hesitancy in lending
its approval to pleas from any party before it, </span></span><span style="">if thereby the true and honest result of the
elections could be <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">elicited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would enable the provinc<sup>i</sup>al
