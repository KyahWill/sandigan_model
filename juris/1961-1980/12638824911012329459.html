now both over eighty-seven years old) were good friends who lived together in
the same house located at Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether
they were partners and acquired properties with common funds is a matter of
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were separated because
of the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>
evacuated to <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
presumably remained at Solano.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1965 Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> sued Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> for the recovery of
her alleged share in Lots 25 and 28 which were registered <span style="">in </span>Francisca's name (Civil Case No.
1454).</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Jose D. <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span> in a decision
dated August 30, 1969 ordered Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
(1) to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> and deliver the possession to Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> of "one-half <u><span style="">undivided</span></u><span style=""> </span>portion
of Lots 25 and 28 of the Solano cadastre" and the improvements thereon and
(2) to pay her the sum of P18,895 as one-half of the accrued rentals up to
July, 1967 and P145 monthly until the possession is delivered to Paz, with
legal rate of interest from the date of the finality of the judgment, plus
P2,000 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> appealed to the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her appeal was
dismissed because she did not file her brief on time (<span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>

October 16, 1970 and August 31, 1971).</p>

Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>, issued an order of execution dated <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that same date, the clerk of court under
the direction of Judge Vicente M. <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>, instead of
issuing only a writ of execution, issued also a "writ of possession",
commanding the provincial sheriff "to require" Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> "to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
one-half (1/2) <u>undivided</u> portion of Lots 25 and 28" and "to

<p class="BODY">The deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in favor of
Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> was executed by the clerk of court on <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that same day it was registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A title was issued to Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>
for <st1:place><u><span style="">Lot</span></u></st1:place><u><span style=""> 28-A</span></u><span style="">, </span>with an area of 1,925 square meters, as her one-half share.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sheriff levied upon the other half of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
28, or Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span> share, in order to

the accrued rentals, attorney'<span style="">s </span>fees
and costs that had already reached the sum of P35<span class="GramE">,853.60</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He scheduled the auction sale on <st1:date year="1972" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="3">March 7,
 1972</st1:date> Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> sued Judge <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span>, Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> and the
provincial sheriff also in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> in order to annul the 1969 judgment in Civil
Case No. 1454 and the execution and levy on one-half of Lot No. 28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second case was docketed as Civil Case <u><span style="">No. 1944</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It was predicated on
the theory that Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco’s</span> action in Civil Case
No. 1454 had already prescribed under the Code of Civil Procedure, the
provisions of which were allegedly not applied by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> filed a motion to dismiss

Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Dunuan</span> in his order of <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1972</st1:date> dismissed it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> then filed in
Civil Case No. 1454 a motion dated <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="4">April
 18, 1972</st1:date> for stay of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She asked the court to "take cognizance" of the parties'
compromise agreement and to terminate the two cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that motion Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
quoted and annexed Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco's</span> letter of March
20, 1972 to her counsel, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> S. La Madrid,
wherein Paz offered to compromise the judgment in Civil Case No. 1454 by
waiving her claim to the rentals and <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the
auction sale if Francisca would withdraw her complaint in Civil Case <u>No.
1944</u>, cancel her notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> on the title of Lot 28-A and agree that they
would simply divide that lot equally as adjudged in Civil Case No. 1454.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said letter reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> alleged in her

terminated and that the court "take cognizance" of the amicable
settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to that amicable settlement and in consonance with
section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
filed in the lower court on <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="4">April 25,

Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span> motion to stay execution and
for the taking cognizance of the compromise agreement, the cancellation of the

eighty-six year old Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> in the compromise
agreement, which was drafted by Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span>
counsel, was secured by said counsel through trickery, deceit and intimidation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco's</span> counsel further
observed that Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span> counsel violated
Canon No. 9 of the Code of Legal Ethics that "a lawyer should not in any
way communicate upon the subject of the controversy with a party represented by
counsel; much less should he undertake to negotiate or compromise the matter
with him, but should deal only with his counsel."</p>

<p class="BODY">Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco's</span> lawyer also contended
that Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span> notice of dismissal and
cancellation of the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> were unnecessary because of the lower

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The opposition of </span>Paz

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have set forth all the
relevant facts so that the case can be viewed in proper perspective and the
merits of the two antago</span>nists' contentions can be justly evaluated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is lamentable that due to the fault of
Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span> counsel she was deprived of
her right to a review of Judge <span class="SpellE">Parayno's</span> 1969
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a scrupulous and painstaking study of the facts and
equities of the case, we have reached the conclusion that the compromise
already mentioned should be enforced but subject to the condition that
Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> should pay attorney's fees of <span style="">P2<span class="GramE">,000</span> adjudged in
Judge <span class="SpellE">Parayno's</span> decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court refused to enforce the compromise because in its
opinion the judgment had already been executed and could no longer be <span class="SpellE">novated</span> by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That stand is not well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
undeniable fact is that the judgment has not yet been fully satisfied because
the monetary liability of Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, under
the lower court's judgment, in the sum of P35<span class="GramE">,853.60</span>,
has not yet been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See sec. 47,
Rule 39, Rules of Court as to the entry of satisfaction of judgment).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the lower court did not find that the offer of
compromise made by Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> was vitiated by
duress or undue influence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the lower court's orders, which authorize the auction
sale, should be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to the
interest of the two octogenarians (now nearing ninety years) that this

- <u>Contempt incident</u>.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- As stated in our discussion of L-35615, the
lower court in its judgment of August 30, 1969 ordered Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> "to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> </span>and
<span style="">deliver possession" of an undivided
one-half portion of Lot 28 of the Solano cadastre (with an area of 3,851 square
meters) and to pay rentals and attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That judgment became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We

Vicente M. <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> issued an order of execution, writ
of execution and a writ of possession to enforce that judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the writ of possession the sheriff was
commanded to eject all adverse occupants of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 28.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As also noted in L-35615,
that judgment was enforced by conveying to Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>
not merely the <span class="SpellE"><u>proindiviso</u></span> one-half portion of
Lot 28 but a <u>segregated</u> one-half share, identified as Lot 28-A (with an
area of 1,925 square meters) and covered by TCT No. T-32210, and by the
issuance of a "writ of possession" whereby Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>
was given not merely the <u>juridical or civil possession</u> of a one-half
portion but was placed in <u>physical possession</u> of Lot 28 and the
improvements thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See

<p class="BODY">It appears that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 28 was later
subdivided into Lots 28-A and 28-B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record shows that <span class="SpellE">Florante</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>,
the sixteen-year old grandson of former Judge Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>,
bought on November 8, 1973 from Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> for
P30,000 and other valuable considerations two-thirds of Lot 28-A (which 2/3
portion has an area of 1, 283 square meters).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>TCT No. 37091 (T-38958) was issued to <span class="SpellE">Florante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> (pp. 69 and 292, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Note that Judge <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>, who retired on <st1:date year="1973" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1973</st1:date>, was the same Judge who
on <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1972</st1:date> issued
the order of execu­tion and the writs of execution and possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See art. 1491, Civil

<p class="BODY">The other one-third portion of Lot 28-A appears to have been sold

M. Benitez (pp. 46 and 279, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Former Judge <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>, as guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>
of his minor grandson, <span class="SpellE">Florante</span>, filed in Civil Case
No. 1454 a petition dated January 21, 1974 to declare Tan <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, as alleged occupants of
Lot 28-A, in contempt of court for having disobeyed the writ of possession (the
same writ that Judge <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> issued on January 25, 1972).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that an order be issued for the <u>demolition
of respondents' improvements</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, in their answer to the petition to declare them
in contempt of court, alleged that the parents of the minor, <span class="SpellE">Florante</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>, should act as his
guardians and not Judge <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>; that the lower court
had no jurisdiction over them, and that the building on the lot sold to <span class="SpellE">Florante</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> belongs to <span class="SpellE">Solodonia</span> Ramos and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>
and not to Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chay</span> and, therefore, they (Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>)
did not disobey any court process and were not guilty of contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chay</span> further contended that the motion for contempt
is not in order because they, as well as <span class="SpellE">Florante</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>, are strangers in Civil Case No. 1454.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of December 4, 1974 held that Tang
Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, as heads of the families occupying the buildings
constructed on Lot 28-A, were bound to obey the writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found them guilty of contempt of court and
sentenced each of them to pay a fine of two hundred pesos, with subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency.</p>

<p class="BODY">It required them to vacate Lot 28-A, to remove or demolish their
improvements within sixty days from the finality of the order, and, in case they
fail to do so, the sheriff was directed to eject them and to demolish their
buildings at their expense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues are whether Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> could be adjudged
in contempt of court in Civil Case No. 1454, although they were not parties
therein, and whether the lower court could order them to vacate the portions of
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 28-<span class="GramE">A</span> allegedly occupied by
their families and compel the <u><span style="">demolition</span></u><span style=""> </span>of their alleged improvements.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that in Civil Case No. 1454 the lower court has no
jurisdiction to adjudge petitioners Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> in contempt of court and
to eject them from Lot 28-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1969 judgment of Judge <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span> is a
judgment in <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>, requiring <u>Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span></u> to deliver to Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>
the possession of "one-half undivided portion of" Lot 28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a judg<span style="">ment <u>in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is conclusive, not against the whole
world, but only "between the parties and their <span class="SpellE">succesors</span>
in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action",
"litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same
capacity" (Sec. 49, Rule 39, Rules of Court; Lopez vs. Director of Lands,
47 Phil. 23, 30).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the judgment orders the delivery of the possession of the
one-half <span class="SpellE"><u>proindiviso</u></span> portion of Lot 28, it is
evident that what it contemplates is the symbolical or constructive delivery of
the civil or juridical possession and not the natural or material pos­session
(possession <u>de facto</u>) which has been actually held for Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> by other persons (See arts. 523, 525 and 531,
Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that in co-ownership "each co-owner owns
the whole, and over it he exercises rights of dominion, but at the same time he
is the owner of a share which is really abstract because until the division is
effected, such share is not concretely determined" (Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Cuaycong</span>, 74 Phil. 601, 604-605).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there is co-ownership, a co-owner's
possession of his share is <u>co-possession</u> which is linked to the
possession of the other co-owners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the judgment, Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span> was
entitled to a writ of execution but not specifically to a so-called "writ
of possession", commanding the sheriff "to eject all adverse
occupants" of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 28.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law specifies the instances when a "writ of
possession" may be issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a
writ of possession is available in a land registration <span class="SpellE">proceeeding</span>,
a proceeding <u>in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u> (Sec. 17, Act 496; <span class="SpellE">Estipona</span> vs. Navarro, L-41825, January 30, 1976, 69 SCRA
285, 291) and in case of extrajudicial foreclosure of a realty mortgage (Sec.
7, Act No. 3135), and even in judicial foreclosure (a <u>quasi in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u> proceeding) provided that the <u>debtor is in
possession</u> of the mortgaged realty and <u>no third person</u>, not a party
to the foreclosure suit, had intervened (Rivera vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ecija</span></span><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Rupac</span>, 61 Phil. 201; Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Mañalac</span>
and Lopez, 89 Phil. 270, 275).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment in Civil Case No. 1454 did not authorize the
issuance of a writ of possession or the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of
the occupants of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 28.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issuance of such writ varied the terms of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ was void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> could not be
adjudged in contempt for having allegedly disobeyed the void writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even in execution sales, the possession of the property sold
cannot be given to the purchaser or last <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
if "a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the
judgment debtor" (Sec. 35, last par., Rule 39, Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is merit in petitioners' contention that the
judgment in Civil Case No. 1454 is not binding on them since <span style="">they (like respondent <span class="SpellE">Florante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> in this
contempt incident) were not parties thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Generally, it is axiomatic "that no man shall be affected by
proceedings to which he is a stranger" (Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ellerman</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Bucknall</span> Steamship
Co., 38 Phil. 514, 520).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"As a general rule, persons who are not parties to an action
or proceeding are not subject to the jurisdiction of a court trying a case, are
not supposed to be aware of the court's order and cannot, <span style="">therefore, be declared guilty of contempt for
violating its orders" (<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> vs. Rodriguez, 116
Phil. 1, 5).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The "writ of
possession" was addressed to the sheriff, not to Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a process intended to enforce a
judgment "for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property
as contemplated in section 8[d], Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "writ of possession" was not
intended to enforce a special judgment for the delivery of real property as
contemplated in sec­tion 9 of Rule 39.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is that disobedience to the execution of a special judgment which may
be punished as contempt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this case, the sheriff
did not execute the mandate in the "writ of possession" to eject the
adverse occupants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere dis</span>obedience
to the writ of possession, <u>which was addressed to the </u><u><span style="">sheriff</span></u><span style=""> and </span>not <span style="">to the adverse
occupants, did not render the ad</span>verse occupants guilty of contempt of
court (<span class="SpellE">Goyena</span> de <span class="SpellE">Quizon</span> vs.
<span style="">Philippine National Bank, 85 Phil. 459;
U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ramayrat</span>, 22 Phil. 183; Mendoza vs. <span class="SpellE">Alano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salceda</span>, 112 Phil.
445).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">adjudging the
petitioners in contempt of court, the trial court relied on Heirs </span>of B.
A. <span style="">Crumb vs. Court of Appeals, L-26167,
January 30, 1970, 31 SCRA 271.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
case, wherein it was held that a contempt order is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
(here, petitioners' appeal from the </span>contempt <span style="">order was not allowed), is different from the instant case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Paz <span class="SpellE">Tanwangco</span>
herself could not have ejected Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> by means of a writ of
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, as their <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
could not forcibly drive them away from the leased premises if they refused to
vacate it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has to resort </span>to <span style="">an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <span class="SpellE">Omnas</span>
vs. Rivera, 67 Phil. 419, which involves an execution sale, it was noted that
"the writ of possession is nothing more than a complement of the writ of
execution which, without the former, is ineffective; for it </span>would <span style="">be useless to order a sheriff to sell a real
property of a judgment debtor if after the sale is made in the manner provided
by law the purchaser, after the expiration of the period of redemption, may not
enter upon the possession of </span>the property thus purchased".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That ruling in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Omnas</u></span>
case has no application to this case because here there was no execution sale.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court, in
sanctioning the summary procedure or shortcut resorted to by <span class="SpellE">Florante</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> in order to get
possession of the portions </span>of <span style="">Lot
28, held by the lessees of Francisca <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,
acted in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its order declaring Tang Tee and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tik</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>
in contempt of </span>court <span style="">and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue of whether <span class="SpellE">Florante</span> <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> could recover possession
