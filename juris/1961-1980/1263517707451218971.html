				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal filed by the American Wire &amp; Cable Company, owner of
the registered trademark DURAFLEX for electric wires, questioning the cor­rectness
of the decision of the Director of Patents (in Inter <span class="SpellE">Partes</span>
Case No. 290) holding that the label DYNAFLEX and Device for electric wires,
sought to be registered by the Central <span class="SpellE">Banahaw</span>
Industries, Inc., is not similar to herein appellant's patented mark.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="2" year="1962">2 June 1962</st1:date>,
Central <span class="SpellE">Banahaw</span> Industries, Inc., applied with the
Director of Patents for registration of the trademark DYNAFLEX and Device to be
used in connection with electric wires, class 20, which mark applicant
allegedly had been using since <st1:date month="3" day="29" year="1962">29
 March 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The American
Wire and Cable Co., Inc., another domestic corporation and authorized user
since 10 April 1958 of the registered trade mark DURAFLEX and Globe
representation, for electric wires, apparatus, machines and supplies, class 20,
opposed the application on the ground that applicant's use of the trademark
DYNAFLEX would cause con­fusion or result in mistakes to purchasers intending
to buy DURAFLEX <span style="">electric wires and goods,
the mark being registered allegedly having practically the same spelling,
pronunciation and sound, and covering the same goods, as that of the <span class="SpellE">opposer</span>. Besides, <span class="SpellE">opposer</span>
contended that there has been no continuous use in commerce of the applicant's
mark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the Director of Patents rendered decision
holding the applicant's mark DYNAFLEX not to be similar to the previously
registered trademark, DURAFLEX.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the application of Central <span class="SpellE">Banahaw</span>
Industries for registration of DYNAFLEX was given due course and the opposition
thereto by Ameri­can Wire &amp; Cable Company dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved in this proceeding is simple:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not the mark DYNAFLEX and Device
is <span class="SpellE">registrable</span> as label for electric wires, class 20,
considering that the trademark DURAFLEX and <span style="">Globe </span>representation, also for electric wires, machines and
supplies under class 20, has been registered more than 4 years earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In ruling in favor of the
herein application, the Director </span><span style="">of
Patents said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></span>
The applicant's trademark is <span style="">a
composite mark consisting of the word DYNAFLEX printed in small letters of the
English alphabet except that letter ‘D’ is capitalized, within a fanciful
device, on top of which is the encircled ini­tials, in downward sequence, of
the Respondent's corporate name, and Jutting out on two sides of the circle are
bolts of lightning, symbolic of elec­tricity.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Opposer's</span>
trademark is DURAFLEX in Capitalized print, except that one crosspiece of the
letter X is in the form of a bolt <span style="">of
lightning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word slants slightly
upward, traversing the center of a figure of the earth or globe.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Resorting now to the semantics of the words, it is clear that both
marks are suffixed by the word FLEX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
word appears in any dictionary having <span style="">as </span>common meaning 'to bend'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Webster's Interna­tional Dictionary, it is
used by the British on electric cord. However, one mark (Respondent's) is
prefixed with DYNA suggesting power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not in itself a <span class="SpellE">rootword</span> but it has been commonly
associa­ted with any source of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
most, it could have been derived from the Greek word '<span class="SpellE">Dynamis</span>'
<span style="">and, generally, the root words commonly
derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> are '<span class="SpellE">dynam</span>'
and 'dynamo'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other (<span class="SpellE">Opposer's</span>) is prefixed with DURA, suggesting durability,
strength and endurance.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Based on the
foregoing comparisons, the trademarks of the parties are different in ap­pearance,
meaning, sound and connotation and hence, are not confusingly similar."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent law, Republic Act 166, as amended, <span style="">on <span class="SpellE">registra<span style="">bility</span></span></span> of trademarks,
prescribes:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span> - The owner of a trademark,
trade-name or service-mark used to distinguish his goods, business or services
from the goods, business or services of others shall have the right to register
the same, unless it:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">xxxxx</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d) Consists
of or comprises a mark or trade name which so resembles a mark or trade-name
registered in the Philippines by another and not abandoned, as <u><span style="">to be likely,</span></u><span style=""> </span>when applied to or used in connection
with the goods, business or services of the applicant, <u><span style="">to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive
purchasers."</span></u><span style=""> </span>(Underlining
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the above-quoted provision that the
determinative factor in a contest involving registration of trade mark is not
whether the challenged mark would actually cause confusion or deception of the
purchasers but whether the use of such mark would <u>likely</u> cause confusion
or mistake on the part of the buying public.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, to constitute an infringement of an existing trademark patent
and warrant a denial of an application for registration, the law does not
require <span style="">that the competing trademarks
must be so identical as to produce actual error or mistake; it would be
sufficient, for purposes of the law, that the similarity between the two labels
is such that there is a possibility or likelihood of the purchaser of the older
brand mistaking the newer brand for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question <span class="GramE">is,</span> when is a trademark
likely to confuse or cause the public to mistake one for another?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earlier rulings of the Court seem to
indicate its reliance on the <u>dominancy</u> test or the assessment of the
essential or <u>dominant</u> features in the competing labels to deter­mine
whether they are confusingly similar.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On this matter, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It has been consistently held that the question of
infringement of a trademark is to be determined by the test of <u>dominancy. </u>Similarity
in size, form, and color, while re<span style="">levant,
is not conclusive. If the competing trademark contains the main or essential or
<u>dominant</u> features of another, and confusion and deception is likely to
result, infringement takes place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Duplication or imitation is not necessary, nor is it necessary that the
infringing label should suggest an effort to imitate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(C. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Neil</span>man</span>
Brewing Co. vs. Independent Brewing Co., 191 F. 489, 495, citing Eagle White
Lead Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Pflugh</span> [CC] 180 Fed. 579).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question at issue in cases of
infringement of trademarks is whether the use of the marks involved would be
likely to cause confusion or mistakes in the mind of the public or deceive
purchasers."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Go <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> vs. Director of Patents, 95 Phil. 1, cited in Lim <span class="SpellE">Hoa</span> vs. Director of Patents, 100 Phil. </span><span style="">214).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fact, even their similarity in sound is taken into
consideration, where the marks refer to merchandise of the same descriptive
proper­ties, for the reason that trade <u>idem <span class="SpellE">sonans</span></u>
constitutes a violation of trade mark patents.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Marvex</u></span><u> Commercial Co.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Hawpia</span> &amp; Co.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the registration of the trademark "<span class="SpellE">Lionpas</span>"
for medicated plaster was denied for being confusingly similar in sound with
"<span class="SpellE">Salonpas</span>", a registered mark also for
medicated<span style=""> plaster, the Court saying:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Two letters of 'SALONPAS' are missing in 'LIONPAS', the first
letter <span class="GramE"><u>a</u> and</span> the letter <u>s</u>.<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Be
that as it may, when the two words are pronounced, the sound effects are
confusingly similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where goods are
advertised over the radio, similarity in sound is of especial sig­nificance (Co
<span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> Sa vs. Director of Patents, 95 Phil. 1, citing <span class="SpellE">Nims</span>, The Law of Unfair Com<span style="">petition and Trademarks, 4th ed., vol. 2, pp. 678-679).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The importance of this rule is emphasized by
the increase of radio advertising in which we are deprived of help of our eyes
and must depend entirely on the ear' (Operators, Inc. vs. Director of Patents, <u>supra</u>.)"</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Along the same line are the rulings
denying registration of a mark containing the picture of a fish (<span class="SpellE">Bangus</span>), as label <span style="">for
soy </span>sauce, for being similar to another registered brand of soy sauce
that bears the picture of the fish carp;<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
or that of the mark bearing the picture of two roosters with the word
"Bantam", as label <span style="">for food </span>seasoning
(<span class="SpellE">vetsin</span>), which would confuse the purchasers of the
same article bearing the registered mark "Hen Brand" that features
the picture of a hen.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The present case is governed by the principles laid down in the
preceding cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The similarity between
the competing trademarks, DURAFLEX and DYNAFLEX, is apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only are the initial letters and the last
half of the appellations identical, but the difference exists only in two out
of the eight literal elements of the designations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coupled with the fact that both marks cover
insulated flexible wires under class 20; that both products are contained in
boxes of the same material, color, shape and size; that the dominant elements
of the front designs are a red circle and a diagonal zigzag commonly related to
a spark or flash of electricity; that the back of both boxes show similar
circles of broken lines with arrows at the center pointing outward, with the identical
legend "Cut Out Ring" "Draw From Inside Circle", no
difficulty is experienced in reaching the conclusion that there is a deceptive
similarity that would lead the purchaser to confuse one product with the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Patents has predicated his decision mostly on the
semantic difference and connotation of the prefixes "<span class="SpellE">Dura</span>"
and "<span class="SpellE">Dyna</span>" of the competing trademarks,
unfortunately forgetting that the buyers are less concerned with the etymology
of the words as with their sound and the dominant features of the design.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, as pointed out in the decision now on appeal, there
are some differences in the mark on the front portion of the box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they pale into insignificance in view of
the close resemblance in the general appearance of the box and the <span class="SpellE">tradenames</span> of the articles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, measured against the dominant-feature standard, applicant's mark
must be disallowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, undeniably, the
dominant and essen­tial feature of the article is the trademark itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike in the case of commodities that are
ordinarily picked up by the purchaser himself from the grocery or market
counters, electric wires are purchased not by their appearance but by the size
(voltage) and length and, most importantly, by brand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is even within layman's knowledge that
different brands of wire have different characteristics and properties; and for
an essential building item as electric wires and supplies, the owner of the
building would not dare risk his property, perhaps his life, on an unknown or
untested brand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would only demand for
what is re­cognized to be the best.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relying on the doctrine enunciated in the <span class="SpellE">Etepha</span>
case<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and the earlier ruling in Lim <span class="SpellE">Hoa</span> vs. Director of
Patents,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
applicant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> contends that the DYNAFLEX mark <span style="">would not </span>confuse or deceive the
buyers and subscribers of the DURAFLEX brand, because electrical wires are of
great value and the pur­chasers thereof are generally intelligent - the
architects, engineers and building contractors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be realized, however, that except perhaps in big constructions,
the designing architect or engineer, or the contractor who will undertake the
work of building, does not himself purchase or place the order for the purchase
of the materials to be used therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
task is oftentimes delegated to another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor are said technical men the ones personally laying down the wiring
system in the building that they could possibly check on whether or not the
correct wires are being used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that
even if the engineer or contractor will specify in the bill of materials the
parti­cular brand of wires needed, there is no certainty that the desired <span style="">product will be acquired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, unlike the pharmacists or druggists, the
dispensers of hardware or electrical supplies are not generally known to pay as
much concern to the brand of articles asked for by the customer and of a person
who knows the name of the brand but is not acquainted with its appearance, the
likelihood of the DYNAFLEX product being mistaken for DURAFLEX is not remote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, as in all other cases of colorable <span style="">imitations, </span>the unanswered riddle is
why, of the millions of terms and <span style="">combinations
</span>of letters and designs available, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had to choose those so closely similar to another's trademark if there was no
intent to take advantage of the goodwill generated by the other mark.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS,</b> the decision appealed
from is hereby set aside, and the application for registration of the trademark
DYNAFLEX for electric wires, class 20, is ordered denied. No costs.</p>
