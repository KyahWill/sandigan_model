				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a verified letter-complaint filed on <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span>
P. Sanchez charged Agustin F. <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span>, Deputy
Sheriff, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> at <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, with immorality.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint alleged that sometime in April 1975, Agustin P. <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span>, first cousin of the complainant, had sexual
intercourse with her through force, threat and intimidation; that the
complainant was forced to give up everything due to fear and she could not
resist because she was physically disabled as she was suffering from polio;
that after the sexual act had been consummated, the respondent warned the
complainant not to reveal to anybody what had happened to her, otherwise he
would kill her; that for a while, she kept silent to avoid discredit and dis­honor
to her family; and that, however, because as a con­sequence of the act
committed by the respondent, the complainant gave birth to a baby girl on <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="12">December 30, 1975</st1:date>, <span style="">she decided to file a complaint against the
respondent.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a third <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated February
24, 1976,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the respondent denied "vehemently the acts imputed to him" and
alleged that the "complainant framed up a charge" to compel his
father "to relax in his claim over the properties also claimed by the
mother of the complainant"; that said dispute "was already
settled"; and that the "complainant has retracted her statement and
is withd<span style="">r</span>awing her
charges".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent attached
as Annex "A" to his comment a sworn letter dated <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1976</st1:date> addressed to the Chief Justice
allegedly written by the complainant withdrawing the complaint she had filed.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In her letter dated <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1976</st1:date>, the complainant denied having executed a letter of
desistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I was surprised <span style="">of </span>this development as I have not executed any letter of
desistance and the only document shown to me by Mr. and Mrs. Agustin <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span> was the affidavit of support they executed in
favor of my child."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in a resolution of <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1977</st1:date>, granted the request of the complainant
that the investigation of this case be conducted in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsi­deration of the
respondent was denied and Atty. Vicente M. <span class="SpellE">Requilme</span>,
an assistant supervising attorney of this Court, was directed to expedite and
terminate the investigation within the shortest possible number of days in
order to minimize the expenses of the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence adduced in the investigation established that the
complainant and the respondent are first cousins because the mother of the
complainant is the sister of the father of the respondent; that the complainant
charged the respondent with rape in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>; that the respondent was acquitted of the crime of
rape<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>;
that the complainant gave birth to a baby girl on December 30, 1975; and that
in the certificate of live birth, the child was given the name <span class="SpellE">Jaquelin</span> Sanchez <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span> and
the informant was the respondent Agustin <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span>
who <span style="">signed said certificate of live
birth.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent adduced evidence that he did not have any sexual
intercourse with the complainant; that the father of the baby of the
complainant is a certain Luis de la Cruz who testified that the complainant was
his sweet­heart from February 1975 to June 1975; that Luis de la Cruz and the
complainant had sexual intercourse on many occasions; <span style="">and that the respondent was only convinced by his wife to </span><span style="">sign as the father in the certificate of live
birth of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Jaquelin</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span> because
said wife pitied the complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The most decisive evidence of the complainant that the respondent
is the father of her child is the certificate of live birth, Exhibit
"A", wherein the respondent signed as the father of the child <span class="SpellE">Jaquelin</span> Sanchez <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Normally no person will sign a certificate of live birth as the father of the
child if he is not so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
denials of the respondent, the weight of the evidence of record is that he is
the father of the child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of
sexual inter­course with the complainant may not be classified as rape but
certainly the manner in which the respondent committed the act is highly
immoral and is sufficient to warrant his dismissal from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant could not move freely because
she had polio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the complainant
and the respondent are cousins within the fourth degree of consanguinity.</p>

<p class="BODY">To add insult to injury, the respondent presented Luis de la Cruz
to testify that he is the father of the child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A cursory examination of the testimony of Luis de la Cruz shows that he
was not a credible witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he
claimed to have had intimate relations with the complainant from February 1975
to June 1975, he never learned where the com<span style="">plainant </span>was working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
excuse was that when he asked the <span style="">complainant
</span>where she worked, she refused to tell him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason at all, if the complainant
was having intimate relations with Luis de la Cruz, why she should not tell him
where she was working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of the
respondent in pre­senting Luis de la Cruz to assume the paternity of the child,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Jaquelin</span></span><span style=""> </span>Sanchez <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span>,
is reprehensible, to say the least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
only aggravates the guilt of the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, the respondent has become un­fit to
continue as an employee of the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He should be dismissed from the service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Fabillaran</span>,
is hereby DISMISSED as Deputy Sheriff of the Court of First <span style="">Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, and with
forfeiture of all retirement privileges and with prejudice to reinstate­ment <span style="">in </span>the national and local governments,
as well as, in any government instrumentality or agency including government
owned or controlled corporations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this decision be attached to his personal record.</p>
