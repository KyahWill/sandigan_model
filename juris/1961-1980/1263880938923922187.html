				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>,
with preliminary injunction, against the orders of respondent judge in Civil
Case No. 633-IV of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte dated August 31, 1976 and October 8, 1976 denying petitioners' motion to
dismiss the complaint filed against them notwithstanding that private
respondent is the brother of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magbaleta</span>, the husband of the other petitioner <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Magbaleta</span>, and the suit
is to have a parcel of land, covered by a Free Patent Title in the name of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, declared to be the property of private respondent,
who claims in said complaint that the third petitioner Susana G. <span class="SpellE">Baldovi</span> is trying to take possession of said land from his
repreÂ­sentative, contending she had bought the same from the spouses <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Romana</span>, said orders
having been issued allegedly in violation of Article 222 of the Civil Code and
Section 1 of Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, there being no allegation in
respondent's complaint that his suit, being between members of the same family,
earnest efforts towards a compromise have been made before the same was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge premised his refusal to dismiss the complaint
upon the sole ground that one of the defendants, petitioner Susana G. <span class="SpellE">Baldovi</span>, the alleged buyer of the land in dispute, is a
stranger, hence the legal provisions above-mentioned do not apply.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court holds that this ruling of respondent judge is
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While indeed, as pointed out by
the Code Commission "it is difficult to imagine a sadder and more tragic spectacle
than a litigation between members of the same family" hence, "it is
necessary that every effort should be made toward a compromise before a
litigation is allowed to breed hate and passion in the family" and
"it is known that a lawsuit between close relatives generates deeper
bitterness than between strangers" (Report of the Code Commission, p. 18),
these considerations do not, however, weigh enough to make it imperative that
such efforts to compromise should be a jurisdictional pre-requisite for the
maintenance of an action whenever a stranger to the family is a party thereto,
whether as a necessary or indispensable one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not always that one who is alien to the family would be willing to
suffer the inconvenience of, much less relish, the delay and the complications
that <span class="SpellE">wranglings</span> between or among relatives more often
than not entail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is neither
practical nor fair that the determination of the rights of a stranger to the
family who just happened to have innocently acquired some kind of interest in
any right or property disputed among its members should be made to depend on
the way the latter would settle their differences among themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no cause in the reason for being of
the provisions relied upon by petitioners to give it broader scope than the
literal import thereof warrants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed and the restraining
order issued on November 3, 1976 is hereby lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioners.</p>
