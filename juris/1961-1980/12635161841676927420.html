Immigration, and his subsequent detention or confinement at the Bureau of

<p class="BODY">The petitioner claims that the warrant of exclusion is­sued by
the respondent is illegal because it is based on a decision rendered by the
Board of Immigration Commissioners without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or
with grave abuse of discretion, in violation of section 27 (b), Comm. Act 613,
as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 9, 1961 the petitioner, with three other persons,
supposedly his widowed mother (Dolores <span class="SpellE">Neria</span>) and two
younger brothers (Felix and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Neria</span>), arrived at
the Manila International Airport from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> on
board a Cathay Pacific Airways plane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner was armed with Certificate of Registration and Identity
621, issued by the Philippine Consulate in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 12-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
immigration inspector at the <span class="GramE">airport,</span> not satisfied
with the petitioner's travel documents and those of his companions upon primary
inspection thereof, referred the matter of their admission to the Board of
Special Inquiry for investigation "to determine <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
and paternity to a Filipino citizen" (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Board of Special
Inquiry No. 1 conducted a hearing on July 14, 1961, at which time the
petitioner offered oral and documentary evidence to support his claim for
admission as a Filipino citizen (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. 13, 13-A,
13-B, 13-C; pp. 342-355, 361, 362, 363, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the conclusion of the investigation, the said board on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1961</st1:date> deliberated on the case
and unanimously voted for petitioner's admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board on the same date rendered its
decision, declaring Dolores <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> a Filipino citizen
(I.C. 61-2311-C; <span class="SpellE">exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A, 1), and
the petitioner a Filipino citizen as he is an illegitimate son of Dolores (I.C.
61-2312-C; <span class="SpellE">exhs</span>.</span> A, 1), and allowing his
admission into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This written decision was subsequently
submitted to the members of the Board of Immigration Commissioners, who, acting
separately thereon on different dates, voted as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span>,
"Noted", on August 13, 1961 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 1-A);
Associate Commissioner De la Rosa, "Noted", on August 31, 1961 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 1-B); and Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
"Exclude all", including the petitioner, either on August 17, 1961 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 1-C) or August 31, 1961, or even afterwards (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 10-12, 18, <span class="SpellE">Baria</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="9">September
 1, 1961</st1:date> the Immigration authorities issued Identification
Certificate 16306 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. C) <span class="GramE">to</span>
the petitioner, attesting that he "was admitted as a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
per decision of the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 dated <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On September 4 a copy of the decision was received by petitioner's
counsel (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. 6, 6-A, H).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1962</st1:date>,
the Secretary of Justice issued Memorandum Order 9 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.

<blockquote>“[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]t appearing
that for the past several years, the Board of Commissioners of Immigration has
not met collectively to discuss and deliberate on the cases coming before it
(Memorandum dated January 16, 1962 of the former First Deputy Commissioner of
Immigration and the Memorandum dated January 19, 1962 of the Commissioner of
Immigration), pursuant to the authority vested in the Department Head by
Section 79 (c) of Act No. 2711, as amended, the public in­terest so requiring,
it is hereby ordered that all decisions purporting to have been rendered by the
Board of Commissioners on appeal from, or on review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of, decisions of the Board of Special
Inquiry are set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Commissioners
is directed to review, in accordance with Section 27 (b) of Commonwealth Act
No. 613, as amended, all decisions of the Board of Spe­cial Inquiry admitting
entry of aliens into the country and give preference to all cases where entry
has been permitted on the ground that the entrant is a citizen of the
Philippines, following the principle laid down in Section 30 of Commonwealth
Act 613, as amended, that ‘the burden of proof shall be upon such alien to
establish that he is not subject to exclusion' and the ruling of this
Department that 'Citizenship is a status of privilege, power and honor of
inestimable value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When doubts exist
concerning a grant of it, they should be resolved in favor of the Government
against the claimant' (1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>, <st1:date year="1947" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1947</st1:date>, from Secretary of
Justice Roman <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span> to the Commissioner of
Immigration)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the above directive, the Board of Immigration
Commissioners, composed of Acting Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span>
P. Vivo, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> N. Gaston, proceeded to review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> the
entire proceedings had before the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 relative to
the petitioner's case (I.C. 61-2312-C) and that of his supposed relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A hearing officer of the Bureau of
Immigration was directed to conduct an investigation of the entire proceedings
of and the evidence presented before the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of a memorandum dated July 30,
1962 of the hearing officer (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. 11, O), the new
Board of Immigration Commissioners found that the petitioner had not
satisfactorily established his claim for admission as a Filipino citizen and,
consequently, reversed the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1, and
ordered that the petitioner be excluded from the Philippines as an alien not
properly documented for admission and be returned to the port from whence he
came or to the country of which he is a national (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
F)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On</span> <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1962</st1:date> the petitioner
moved for a reconsideration of said decision (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied by the new
Board on <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1962</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 9), and the petitioner was informed of this
denial by letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="10">October 18,
 1962</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1963 the petitioner filed a petition for <u>certiorari</u>
and prohibition (CC 52875), praying the Court of First Instance of Manila to
restrain the Commissioner of Immigration and the Board of Immigration
Commissioners from arresting and expelling him, and prohibit them from taking
any further steps or actions contrary to the decision rendered by the Board of
Special Inquiry No. 1 on August 2, 1961 (exh.15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was given due course, and a
writ of preliminary injunction was issued as prayed for (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>.
18, 19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this petition was dismissed
on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>,
"without prejudice and without costs" (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
20).</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 30, 1965 the present petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
was filed, the petitioner claiming that the respondent's agents picked him up
at Rosario St., Manila, in the evening of the previous April 23 on the supposed
claim that he was not properly documented for admission as a Filipino citizen
when he entered the Philippines; and that since then he "has been
unlawfully and illegally confined, restrained and deprived of his liberty in
the Bureau of Immigration Detention Station in the Engineering Island,
Manila." On the same date, the lower court required the respondent to
bring the petitioner before the court on <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="5">May
 3, 1965</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clerk of court
issued the corresponding writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> directing the
respondent to submit his return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter's written return of May 6, 1965 states, among other things, that the
petitioner was under lawful custody on a valid process commanding his exclusion
from the Philippines and ordering his return to the port where he came from or
to the country of which he is a national.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 18, 1965 the lower court dismissed the petition on the
ground that "the present Board of Commissioners did not act without due
process of law, in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion,
in reviewing <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
and reversing the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry, the petitioner is
legally detained on a warrant issued by the respondent Commissioner of
Immigration." On June 23 the petitioner moved for a reconsideration of
said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1966</st1:date> the respondent filed opposition to
the motion for re­consideration, to which the petitioner filed a reply.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1965</st1:date>
the lower court set aside its decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1965</st1:date>, and, on the same date, rendered an <u>amended</u>
decision completely reversing its decision of June 17, granted the writ of <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> and ordered the immediate release of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court held that "the decision
rendered by the new Board of Commissioners is null and void for lack of
jurisdiction, and no administrative action being possible because the question
involved in this case is purely a legal question, the doctrine of exhaustion of
administrative remedies has no application in this case." On July 22 the
clerk of court issued the corresponding writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 23 the respondent perfected an appeal
from the amended decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 26
the petitioner filed an urgent motion for admission to bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 27 the lower court granted the
petition and fixed the amount of bail for the petitioner's release at P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
On this last date also, the lower court ordered the transmittal of the original
records of the case to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legality or illegality of the petitioner's detention or
confinement<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
depends upon resolution of the issue of whether the decision of the new Board
of Immigration Commissioner is null and void for having been rendered without
or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion, in
violation of section 27 (b), Comm. Act 613, as amended, which provides in part
that</p>

<blockquote>"[t]he decision of any two members of
the board [of Special Inquiry] shall prevail and shall be final unless reversed
on appeal by the Board of Commissioners as hereafter stated, or, in the absence
of an appeal, unless reversed by the Board of Commissioners after a review by
it, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
of the entire proceedings within one year from the promulgation of said
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The resolution of this issue, in turn,
depends upon the determination of the date when the decision of the Board of
Special Inquiry No. 1 was promulgated, August 2, 1961 when it was actually
rendered, or September 4, 1961 when the petitioner was actually notified thereof
and a copy received by his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
date of promulgation is important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
from that date that the one-year period commenced within which the Board of
Immigration Commissioners could review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span> the entire proceedings of the Board of Special
Inquiry No. 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the Solicitor General, the correct date of
promulgation is September 4, 1961, because under the Immigration Rules and
Regulations,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the decision of a Board of Special Inquiry "shall be <u>rendered</u> in
writing"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>,
and under section 27 <u>supra</u> the written decision "shall be <u>promulgated</u>";
that the words “rendition" (from “rendered") and “promulgation"
(from "promulgated") connote two separate and distinct acts required
to be accomplished by the Board of Special Inquiry, for rendition is the date
when a judge signs his decision and files it with the clerk of court, whereas
promulgation is the date when such decision is published, officially announced,
is made known to the public, or delivered to the clerk of court for filing,
coupled with notice to the parties or to their coun­sel; and that in this case,
rendition was accomplished on August 2, 1961 when the Board of Special Inquiry
No. 1 concluded its hearing on the petitioner's case (I.C. 61-2332-C),
deliberated thereon, voted for his admission into the Philippines and rendered
its written decision, and promulgation was accomplished on September 4, 1961
when the petitioner was actually notified of the decision, copy of which was
received by his counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">No amount of hair-splitting in regard to the words "rendition"
and "promulgation" would convey different meanings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court defined promulgation as "the
delivery of the decision to the Clerk of Court for filing and publication"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word "promulgate" was viewed by
the majority in <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Dinglasan</u></span>
(77 Phil. 764) as the entry made by the clerk of a judgment or order in the
book of entries of judgments made by said clerk.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's argument, at all events, is without me­rit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 27 (b), <u>supra</u>, provides that
proceedings of the Board of Special Inquiry -- its appraisal of a case on the
me­rits, the result of its deliberation, its decision and notice thereof to an
alien, and the time when an appeal may be brought <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
-- "shall be conducted under rules of procedure to be prescribed by the
Commissioner of Immigration." Quoted hereunder for ready reference are the
pertinent sections of the Immigration Rules and Regulations:</p>

<blockquote>"All proceedings of the boards shall be made of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Utmost care must be exercised in taking down
the testimony of the applicant and his witnesses, es­pecially with regard to
dates, names, and description of persons and places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doubtful and contradictory answers should, as
far as practicable, we clarified." (sec. 10) </blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the conclusion of the hearing in any case, the Board shall
at once proceed to deliberate and decide on the merit thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result of such deliberation, including
the vote of each member of the board, shall be recorded as part of the proceedings
and immediately reported for notation to the officer in charge at the port, or
other duly authorized official." (sec. 11)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the result of the deliberation shows that at least two
members vote for landing, a note thereof shall be made and the alien shall
without waiting for the decision to be put in writing, be released from
custody, if the other member of the board does not dissent and give notice of
his desire to appeal; otherwise, the alien shall remain in the detention
station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a dissenting member appeals
from the decision of the other two members, the case shall be taken before the
Board of Commissioners for decision." (sec. 12)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The decision of any two members of the board shall
prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in any case shall
be rendered in writing as soon as possi­ble, but not later than two days from
the date of the deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If for any
reason the board is not able to promulgate its decision within the above
prescribed period, the reason or reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
shall be noted in the re­cords of the proceedings." (sec. 13, Subdivision
E, Rule 1)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When an alien is excluded by a board of special inquiry he
shall be advised of the decision together with the reason or reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; also of his right to appeal his case to the Board
of Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In every case the alien
shall be furnished with a copy of the decision upon promulgation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the applicant appeals, he shall thereupon
be informed of his right to be represented by attorney or counsel in
prosecuting his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attorney or
counsel representing an appellant shall have access to the records of the
proceedings of the board in the particular case, and may also appear in person
before the Board of Commissioners on behalf of his client." (sec. 14)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appeal must be in writing and filed with the board of special
inquiry which decided the case, within forty-eight hours from the time a copy
of the decision is furnished the applicant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No appeal filed after this period shall be accepted." (sec. 16,
Subdivision B, Rule 2)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The record of the hearing and all documents considered by a
board of special inquiry in reach­ing its decision shall be forwarded, within
two days from the date of notice of intention to appeal is filed, to the
Commissioner of Immigration for reconsideration by the Board of
Commissioners." (sec. 17, Subdivision C, Rule 2)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If, as provided in section 12 above, "the result of the
deliberation [of the Board of Special Inquiry] shows that at least two members
vote for landing, a note thereof shall be made and the alien shall, <u>without</u>
waiting for the <u>decision</u> to be <u>put</u> <u>in</u> <u>writing</u>, be
released from custody", then promulgation can take place even before a
decision is actually written and a copy thereof served upon the alien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, if, as provided in section 14 above,
"[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n every case the <u>alien</u> shall be <u>furnished</u>
with a <u>copy</u> of the <u>decision</u> <u>upon</u> <u>promulgation</u>
thereof," then notice of a decision of the board shall be made only after
or upon promulgation, and not before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
both sections 12 and 14, therefore, promulgation always takes place before copy
of the written decision of the board is furnished to an alien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, section 12 contemplates an alien
who is under "custody", while section 14 contemplates a case of an
alien "excluded by a board of special inquiry".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, there seems to be no reason why
the same rule would not apply to the case at bar, where the petitioner, who was
"unanimously voted" for admission by the Board of Special Inquiry No.
1, was at liberty pending the conclusion of the investigation of his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> and paternity to a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in any of these circumstances, the date
of promulgation is the date when the Board of Special Inquiry in question voted
and resolved to admit an alien, and this date can be ascertained from the
minutes of the proceedings had before such board.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This, in effect, was our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Arocha</span>, etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> Vivo,
etc., et al., and <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> Vivo, etc., vs. Hon.
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, etc., et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
on the issue of the correct date of promulgation of a decision of the Board of
Immig­ration Commissioners reversing that of the Board of Special Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, speaking thru Mr. Justice J.B.L.
Reyes, held that "the <u>operative</u> <u>date</u> of the Commissioners'
action <u>is</u> that <u>when</u> the <u>resolution</u> <u>of</u> <u>exclusion</u>
<u>was</u> <u>voted</u> <u>and</u> <u>adopted</u> by them as a Board, <u>regardless</u>
<u>of</u> the <u>date</u> <u>when</u> the <u>decision</u> in <span class="SpellE">extenso</span> <u>was</u> <u>prepared</u>, <u>written</u> and <u>signed</u>",</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">because</span> the
decision <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>extenso</u></span> must relate back to
the day the resolution to exclude was actually adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the extended opinion had to be
posterior to the day when the Commissioners voted and resolved to reverse the
findings of the Board of Special Inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Secretary's certificate (Annex F, L-24853) shows that the Board of
Immigration Commissioners acted upon not less than eight immigration cases (including
that of the <span class="SpellE">Gatchalians</span>) on July 6, 1962; and it was
of course impracticable to prepare and sign fully reasoned decisions in all
these cases on the same day."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case, <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="8">August 2,

Computing the one-year period from <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="8">August
 2, 1961</st1:date>, the Board of Immigration Commissioners had until <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1962</st1:date> within which to review
the proceedings <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of the petitioner (I.C. 61-2312-C) was included in the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Apropos are the following observations of
the learned trial judge, the Hon. Luis Reyes:</p>

<blockquote>"The minutes of the meeting of the new Board of Commissioners
and, the testimony of its Secretary show that as late on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1962</st1:date>, the new Board of Commissioners was
only deliberating on the case of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The admission of the Secretary of the new
Board of Commissioners that the case of the petitioner was not acted upon on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1962</st1:date>, shows that the
alteration of the date of the decision of the new Board of Commissioners from <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1962</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1962</st1:date> was deliberate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the case of the petitioner was
submitted to the new Board of Commissioners for its resolution on August 2,
1962, is no excuse for ante-dating its decision which was actually rendered
after that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1962</st1:date>, it did not reverse the decision of
the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1, because having actually deliberated on the
case of the petitioner on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="8">August 8,
 1962</st1:date>, it could not have on August 2 resolved to reverse the
decision of the Board of Special Inquiry."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The alteration of the true date of the decision of the new
Board of Commissioners, made upon instruction of the respondent Commissioner of
Immigration, is revealing; it shows that the respondent Commissioner knew that
the one-year period was to be computed from August 2, 1961; it shows also that
he knew that if the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 had to be
reversed, the new Board of Commissioners had to act not la­ter than August 2,
1962."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As it was on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="8">August 8,
 1962</st1:date> when the Board of Immigra­tion Commissioners as a body
deliberated on and voted for the reversal of the decision of the Board of
Special Inquiry No. 1, the review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> was <span class="GramE">effected</span> 6 days
beyond the one-year period fixed y section 27 (b), <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said <span class="GramE">decision of the
Board of Immigration Commissioners, and the warrant of exclusion issued on the
strength of such decision, are</span> therefore, as correctly found by the
lower court, null and void, for "lack of jurisdiction," since the
decision of the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 by that time had already become
"final."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent also contends that the petitioner's peti­tion for <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> was prematurely filed, because he did not first appeal the
decision of the Board of Immigration Commissioners to the Secretary of Justice,
who, by law, is vested with power of control and supervision over the said
Board.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We have already held that the principle of exhaustion of administrative
remedies is inapplicable "where the question in dispute is purely a legal
one"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>,
or where the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> act is “patently
illegal" or was performed without jurisdiction or in excess of
jurisdiction and "nothing of an administrative nature is to be or can be
done” thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The case at bar falls under these exceptions, as correctly found by the lower
court:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">the</span> facts
are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision (amended)
is mainly based on the record of the proceedings of the new Board of
Commissioners and also on the testimony of its secretary, which is not disputed
by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matters determined
by the Court, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the meaning of
the term ‘promulgation’ in relation to the Rules and Regulations of the Bureau
of Immigration, and (2) the time the reversing decision of the new Board of
Commissioners was actually rendered, involve questions of law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is of no moment that before the present petition for <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> was instituted, the petitioner had previously filed petition for <u>certiorari</u>
and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of that
petition was "without prejudice", and, therefore, avoided the effects
of the Rules of Court provision (Rule 30, sec. 3, now Rule 17, sec. 3) that
dismissal for failure to prosecute is equivalent to "an adju­dication on
the merits [with prejudice].<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The order of dismissal therein did not settle the legality of the acts of the
Board of Commissioners, <span class="GramE">nor</span> the legality of petitioner's
arrest and detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order
dismissing the pe­tition for <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition simply recites
that the same is "dismissed without prejudice and without costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in <u>Aurora <span class="SpellE">Villamin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> vs. Commissioner of</u> Immigration<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
that the action of petitioners therein is barred by the principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>" is not applicable to this case for factual
differences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the special
proceeding for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> "was not instituted until <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1962</st1:date>, or almost seven (7)
years after the rendition of the decision of the Board of Commissioners on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date> and the issuance of
