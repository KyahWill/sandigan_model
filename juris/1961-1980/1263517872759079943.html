				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayrama</span> from the decision of the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> finding them guilty of the crime of robbery
with rape committed in the municipality of Naval, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
on November 28, 1964 and sentencing each of them to suffer the penalty of
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, with all the accessories provided
for by law; to indemnify, jointly and severally, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Layon</span>
in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mondelo</span> in the sum of P1,000.00, and to pay the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They now urge us to re­verse said
decision claiming that the trial court committed the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE COURT A QUO
ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED SUFFICIENTLY IDENTIFIED AND DISREGARD­ING
ALTOGETHER THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE COURT A QUO
ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF THE CHARGE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT AND
SENTENCING THEM ACCORDINGLY."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence has conclusively established the
following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time> in the
evening of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1964</st1:date>,
while <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Mondelo</span> and her
granddaughter Lydia <span class="SpellE">Layon</span> were asleep in the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> house located in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Panimbangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catmon</span>, Naval, <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Lydia</st1:country-region></st1:place>
was awakened by the noise produced by the opening of a window. Frightened, she
covered her face with her blanket, but when she heard footsteps inside the
house she uncovered her face and then saw the appellants approaching her
grandmother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corpin</span>
awakened the latter by kicking her and once she had been awakened, he demanded
money from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she told him that
she had no money, she was boxed, and thereafter appellants tied her hands and
made her <span class="GramE">lie</span> face downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Gayrama</span>
then ransacked the house and found P25.00 in a small cardboard box, took a
guitar worth P9.00, a pair of pants valued at P8.00, a mat worth P4.00 and a
chicken, all of which he handed to a companion who had remained downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Gayrama</span>
also tied the hands of Lydia with a rope and, having thus rendered her
helpless, started mashing her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
later brought downstairs by both appellants and once there <span class="SpellE">Corpin</span>,
through force, succeeded in felling her to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then grabbed and pulled out her panty and,
<span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of Lydia's resistance, succeeded in having
sexual intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
<span class="SpellE">Gayrama</span> and their other companions took turns in
raping her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After thus satisfying their
lust, appellants took Lydia upstairs and then left with their loot not without
first warning her and her grandmother not to tell anybody of what had happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly after the events just stated, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liquiran</span>, son-in-law of the old woman <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Mondelo</span>, arrived and after
being told of what had happened, he took both women to his house, one and
one-half kilometers away, and early the following morning, he accompanied them
to file the corresponding complaint with the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of the same day (November
29) <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Mondelo</span> was
examined at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Naval</st1:placename> <st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> and was found to have been
suffering from a 2 by 1 centimeter <span class="SpellE">Hematoma</span> in the
scapular region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days later Lydia
was also examined at the same hospital and was found suffering from, and was
treated for the following injuries –</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fading
linear <span class="SpellE">petechiae</span> both wrist on lateral medial &amp;
dorsal surface, 1 cm. maximum width.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INTERNAL EXAMINATION:
Bleeding from vaginal orifice moderate in amount with fleshy smell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lacera­tion of the hymen &amp; vagina lip at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> 2 cm. in length at posterior
end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A, B; pp. 87, <span class="GramE">88 <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., </span><st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="8"><span class="GramE">Aug. 10, 1965</span></st1:date>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants rely on an alibi claiming that on November 28, 1964
they attended the barrio fiesta of <span class="SpellE">Villacaneja</span>,
within the same municipality of Naval, having stayed there until they went home
to barrio <span class="SpellE">Caray-Caray</span> between five and six o'clock in
the afternoon; that both of them remained in their respective house the whole
night of November 28.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issues before us are, on the one hand, the sufficiency of
the prosecution evidence identifying appellants herein as the men who committed
the acts mentioned heretofore, and, on the other, the sufficiency of the
defense evidence to prove the defense of alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">After going over the record, <span class="GramE">We</span> are
fully convinced that the identity of the two appellants as the perpetrators of
the crime charged has been established beyond question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lydia <span class="SpellE">Layon</span> saw
them from the moment they succeeded in entering the house of her grandmother
through the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could not have
been mistaken as to their identity because at that time there was a big
petroleum lamp inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
grandmother likewise recognized them and she, as well as her granddaughter,
informed her son-in-law of what had happened when the latter arrived in the
house shortly after the departure of the malefactors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Mondelo</span> and her granddaughter gave the authorities the
names of both appellants herein as the perpetrators of the crime charged the
very day following the commission of the crime, and lodged the complaint on the
same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 2, 1964 Lydia made
a sworn statement before the P.C. Detachment, pointing to the two appellants
herein as the ones who had committed the robbery and that they were the first
to rape her on that tragic evening.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, there is absolutely no evidence showing bias
or malice on the part of the old woman <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Mondelo</span> and her granddaughter, nor on the part of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> son-in-law, sufficient to have impelled them to
falsely charge appellants with such a grave crime as that of robbery with rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with their defense, appellants claim that they had
gone to barrio <span class="SpellE">Villacaneja</span> to attend the fiesta on
board a passenger jeep, but the truth is that they could not even give the name
of the driver of the vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the barrio of their residence, <span class="SpellE">Caray-Caray</span>, was only
one and one-half kilometers away from the scene of the crime and it is obvious
that this circumstance does not make it physically impossible for them to have
committed the crime after they had reached home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, their testimony is not supported by
any other solid and credible evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information filed against appellants charges them only with
robbery with rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court,
however, found them guilty of the crime of robbery with rape, and <u>slight
physical injuries</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
office of the Solicitor General that the conviction for slight physical
injuries should be disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the indemnity awarded to the offended parties should be reduced
to the sum of P58.00 which, according to the evidence, is the total value of
the cash and articles of which the victims were robbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In accordance with the provisions of Article 335 of the Revised
Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 4111, whenever the crime of rape is
committed by two or more persons as in the present case - the penalty shall be
<i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i> to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the record does not show conclusively the
existence of any aggravating circumstance attending the commission of the
offense charged, We are of the opinion that the penalty of <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i> imposed by the trial court is in accordance with
law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, modified as above indicated, the appealed
decision is affirmed in all other respects.</p>
