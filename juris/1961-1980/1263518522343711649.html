				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this foreclosure of mortgage suit, the lower court unable to
perceive any persuasive force in five of the six special defenses set forth by
defendants, now appellants curtly dismissed them as "lacking in
merit."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It decided in favor of
plaintiffs, now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants would have us reverse, raising in
the process a question novel in character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is their contention that the lower court's laconic and terse
disposition of such special defenses failed to <span style="">abide by the constitutional command </span>that a court of record
should state in its decision clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on
which it is based.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As will hereafter be more fully expounded, the lower court did not thereby lay
itself open to the valid accusation of having disregarded the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it did decide correctly that on the
duly proven facts, the law did call for a foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 21, 1962 plaintiffs, <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> Jose and Jose S. Jose, filed a complaint for
the foreclosure of mortgage with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch VI, then presided by Judge, now Justice of
the Court of Appeals, Andres Reyes, alleging that on December 10, 1960
defendant <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> Santos, in her own <span style="">behalf </span>and as attorney-in-fact of her
co-defendants, <span class="SpellE">Mons</span>. Pedro P. Santos and <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> Santos, borrowed from the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> Jose the sum of
P714<span class="GramE">,786.65</span>, payable in Philippine currency in various
installments specifying the respective dates from <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1961</st1:date> until <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1970</st1:date> and the amounts to be paid at such
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the allegation that to
secure "the prompt and faithful payment of the aforesaid sum"
defendant <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> Santos, again in her own behalf
and as attorney-in-fact of the other defendants, executed and delivered to the
plaintiffs on December 19, 1960 a first mortgage on two parcels of land in the
province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, duly registered, a copy of such
deed of mortgage being attached to the complaint. After which, the fact of such
mortgage being duly registered on <st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1960">December
 29, 1960</st1:date> and duly annotated in the original and transfer
certificates of title was set forth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After mentioning that one of the conditions of such mortgage is that
failure to pay any of the installments specified would make the whole
obligation due and demandable, thus giving full force and effect to the
mortgage, and that defendants had paid only up to the June 30, 1961
installment, the amount due on December 31, 1961 as well as those subsequently
payable not having been satisfied resulting in their thus being obliged to pay
in full the balance of P561,093.40, which, notwithstanding repeated demands,
defendants failed and refused to pay, <span style="">plaintiffs
</span>sought the payment of the above sum with interest at the legal rate,
failure to do so calling for a judgment and decree of foreclosure, as well as
attorney's fees in the sum of P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants, on February 26, 1963, filed their answer specifically
denying the allegations of the complaint and setting forth five special
defenses with counterclaims, the first of which would stress that the amount
claimed was not due and demandable <span style="">as </span>there was no default on their part, there
being a failure in accordance with the understanding between the parties to
credit them the sum <span style="">a </span>P200,250.00
<span style="">as </span>the
share of the plaintiffs in the expenses incurred for the registration of the
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Sanjonar</span>, owned jointly by plaintiffs as
well as defendants, who were thus entitled to reimbursement in the a<span style="">b</span>ove amount
being one-half of the total sum of P400,500.00 advanced by the defendants
subject to such reimbursement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants then alleged that the suit being thus unwarranted and
unfounded did injure their business, social and credit standing, cost them
physical suffering, mental anguish and serious anxiety, for which they should be
awarded moral damages in the sum of not less than P200,000.00 and exemplary
damages in the sum of at least P50,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The four other special defenses with counterclaims would find fault with
the failure of plaintiffs to deliver to defendants the owner's duplicate of two
original certificates of title covering two lots in the province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, which, according to defendants, were owned by them
jointly with plaintiffs, such failure preventing them from obtaining loans of
not less than P100,000.00; with the refusal of plaintiffs to reimburse
defendants for their share in the purchase of firearms in the sum of P7,750.00,
one-half of which should be paid by plaintiffs; with plaintiffs allegedly
making fraudulent use of a special power of attorney, having misled defendants
into signing the same, and mortgaging certain lots jointly owned by them with
the Philippine National Bank to secure a loan in the sum of P15,000.00, all the
proceeds of which plaintiffs did appropriate for themselves, the counterclaim
sought being in the amount of P18,000.00; with plaintiffs' refusal to lend to
them the owner's duplicate of original certificate of title No. 2054 with a
view to undertaking the subdivision survey of lot No. 11 of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Sanjonar</span> and their failure to give consent to defendants'
request for a second mortgage on such lot in favor of the Republic Bank of
Manila to secure a repayment of a loan of P900,000.00 of defendants from said
bank, the counterclaim sought being in the amount of P50,000.00; and that the
actuations of plaintiffs did result in defendants having to hire the services
of counsel entitling them to a judgment for P50,000.00 for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial duly had, with two witnesses testifying, Jose S. Jose
for plaintiffs and <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> Santos for defendants,
and with the submission of documentary evidence, the lower court rendered a
decision on May 26, 1965 ordering defendants to pay not the amount sought of
P561,093.40 but the sum of P553,096.00 within 90 days from receipt of such
decision, in default of which the mortgaged property was to be sold at public
auction and the proceeds thereof to be applied for the satisfaction of the
mortgage indebtedness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs were
also awarded P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The special defenses and counterclaims were,
as noted, "<span class="GramE">dismissed</span> for lack of merit." To
be more accurate, while the counterclaim resulting from the first special
defense was thus dismissed, there was a detailed consideration of such special
defense consisting of the allegation that defendants were not credited with the
amount of P200<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>, representing the reimbursement
due them for the expenses of the registration of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Sanjonar</span>
owned jointly with plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal, with fourteen errors allegedly having been
committed by the lower court, twelve of which are factual in character and the
last a logical corollary of the other <span style="">errors </span>assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted at the outset, a Constitutional
question was likewise raised, the eighth assigned error being to the effect
that in thus dismissing the five special defenses for lack of merit, there was
a violation of the constitutional requirement that a decision of a <span style="">court </span>of record must <span style="">express
"clearly </span>and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is
based.‚Äù We repeat that there is no justification for the reversal of the lower
court decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span><span style="">take up firs</span>t the constitutional question earnestly pressed that
the lower court by summarily rejecting as without merit five of the six special
defenses raised failed to accord respect for the constitutional mandate that a
decision of a court of record must express "clearly and distinctly the
facts and the law on which <span style="">it is </span>based.‚Äù<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worth
noting that this provision of the Constitution did not provoke any debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates apparently <span style="">were </span><span style="">of </span>one mind as to its
desirability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is intended to assure
that judicial decisions can stand the light of scrutiny both from the bar and
the informed public and that party litigants are not left in the dark as to the
basis of the decision arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, fidelity to what is thus ordained would likewise facilitate
the work of appellate tribunals in passing upon matters submitted to them for
review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution thus specifies how a court of record is to
exercise <span style="">judicial
</span>power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is the function of
a court <span style="">to </span>decide the case
before it, whether criminal or civil, and if the latter, be it an ordinary
suit, a special civil action, or a special proceeding, by applying the law to
the facts as ascertained, whether as admitted or stipulated or proven by
competent evidence. Such a decision by a court of record should be embodied in
an opinion where, in a manner clear and distinct, there is a recital of the
events that did transpire and the controlling legal norm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since a case involves a dispute with the
plaintiff or petitioner asserting that a right has been violated by defendant
or respondent, there being a need for the operation of the sanction that the
law affords to redress the wrong, all that is required of the judiciary is that
the decision rendered makes clear why either party prevailed under the
applicable law to the facts as established.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there any rigid formula as to the language to be employed
to satisfy the requirement of clarity and distinctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discretion of the particular judge in
this respect, while not unlimited, is necessarily broad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no sacramental form <span style="">of words which he must use upon pain of being
considered as having failed to abide by what the Constitution directs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
a realm where his individuality is not stifled, his habitual mode </span>of
giving expression to his thoughts respected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It suffices that his decision is not tainted with that degree of
ambiguity that opens vistas of doubt both as to what the facts really were and
the significance attached to them by the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court decision now on appeal cannot thus be justly
characterized as having offended <span style="">against
</span>this constitutional prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a failure to pay certain installments due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole obligation was thus demandable and
the mortgage could be foreclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six
special defenses were alleged to defeat <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court took pains to
explain why the first of them could not be given credence and belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He felt no such need for such elaborate treatment
as to the other five, being convinced of their lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said so clearly and distinctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the most cursory reading of the decision
makes manifest why on the facts duly established, the law is definitely on the
side of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence the utter lack of basis of the eighth assigned error, imputed to
the lower court, of disregarding this particular provision of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first seven errors
alleged by appellants would impugn the conclusion reached by the lower court
that <span style="">in </span>accordance with the
promissory note and the deed of mortgage the obligation became due and
demandable, reducing the <span style="">amount,
however, to P553<span class="GramE">,096.00</span> instead of the amount claimed
of P560,793.80.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As admitted in the brief
of appellants, nine payments out of a total of fourteen alleged by them were
admitted by plaintiffs, leaving only five <span style="">sums </span>which they claimed should have been credited to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court in turn did recognize that in
addition the <span style="">amounts </span>of P700.00
and P6<span class="GramE">,997.71</span> should likewise be deducted from the
obligation still owing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispute,
therefore, would center only on the claim for P200<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>
which defendants would want plaintiffs to credit them and the two additional
sums of P27,0</span>00.<span style="">00 and
P47,370.35.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why <span style="">these re</span>spective alleged payments should not be considered was
explained clearly in the decision now on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as to the amount of P200<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>,
the lower court made this finding:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Both parties - plaintiffs and defendants - claimed that the sum of
P200,250.00, which plaintiffs owed the defendants before the execution of the
deed of sale and the deed of mortgage was to be applied to the purchase price
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 17.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, both parties differed in the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs claimed that the price stated in
the deed of <span style="">sale in </span>the amount
of P714<span class="GramE">,786.65</span> was fixed after deducting what they
owed the defendants, that is to say, the sum of P200,250.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, plaintiffs contended that the
purchased price of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 17 was P714<span class="GramE">,786.65</span>
plus P200,250.00 and that when the deed of sale was executed the said sum of
P200,250.00 was deducted and that is the reason why the purchase price <span style="">was </span>reduced to P714,786.65.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants, however, have a different
version.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They said that the <span style="">P714<span class="GramE">,786.65</span> was
actually the </span><span style="">purchase </span><span style="">price </span>of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
17 and from this amount must be deducted the sum of P200,250.00; that after
this amount has been deducted according to the defendants, they cannot be
considered in default."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the above statement, the lower court, duly noting the
circumstances surrounding the execution of the deed of <span style="">sale </span>of Lot 17 and the mortgage deed as well as the exhibits
submitted by the parties, concluded that it could not "believe the theory
of the defendants, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Why <span style="">no </span>such credence could be
imparted to the contention resulted from its <span style="">appraisal </span>of the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deed of <span style="">sale </span>of lot 17 in
question and the deed of mortgage having been executed on December 10, 1960,
nothing about such amount was mentioned in either document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, there was the express admission that
the sum of P714<span class="GramE">,786.65</span> was the mortgage indebtedness
of defendants. <span style="">Moreover, </span>a series of promissory notes were executed, the <span style="">first installment </span>of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> being payable on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court could thus reasonably conclude that if the sum of P200<span class="GramE">,250.00</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">was </span>to be applied
as partial liquidation, then defendants woul<span style="">d </span>not have executed the <span style="">promissory
notes amounting to P100,000.00 to cover </span>the first installment due on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1961</st1:date>. It <span style="">would also </span>logically follow that as
the <span style="">mortgage indebtedness was thus to
be </span>reduced in the amount of P200<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>, there
would be no reason for defendants to pay the next installment of <span style="">P14,300.00 due on </span>April 15, 1961 and
P32,392.85 due on June <span style="">30, </span>1961,
as <span style="">the afore¬≠</span>said amount of
P200,250.00 would have covered all of <span style="">such
install</span>¬≠<span style="">ments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion arrived at by the lower court, which <span style="">cannot </span>be indicted for arbitrariness,
insofar as this contention is concerned, follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‚ÄúIt is indeed surprising, if we follow the
version of the defendants, why the <span style="">sum </span>of
P200<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>, which is already a fortune was never
mentioned in Exhibits A <span style="">and C </span><span style="">considering that the said two documents were,
according to defendant <span class="SpellE">Priscila</span> Santos herself,
prepared by her brother Atty. Ignacio Santos who also acted as one of the
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because if the sum of
P200,250.00 <span style="">was </span>to be deducted
from the purchase price of P714,786.65 that <span style="">fact </span>would <span style="">surely have </span>appeared
in both documents as it is safe to presume that Atty. Santos would do everything
legally to protect the defendants who are brothers and sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, defendants' payment of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> broken into <span style="">several
promissory notes, </span>as well as the other subsequent installments <span style="">have betrayed </span>the fact that the sum of
P200,250.00 had already <span style="">been paid by </span>the
plaintiffs to the defendants at the time of the execution of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">A and C."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor did the lower court stop there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Besides, as already stated, the above installments appearing in
the deed of mortgage were spread out from 1961 to 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the payments on these installments are
summed up, the grand total will be P714<span class="GramE">,786.65</span>. Now,
what will be the purpose of the parties in specifying the amount as well as the
date that these amounts should be paid if it were true that the sum of P200<span class="GramE">,250.00</span> has yet to be deducted from the purchase price of
the land in question?"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It would thus follow that the first special defense raised was clearly devoid
of any force.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court next took up the alleged payments of P27<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and P47,370.35 which defendants would assert ought
to have been credited to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the
sum of P27<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the appealed decision had this to <span style="">say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>"With
respect to the sum of P27,000.00 which the <span style="">Juvenile and </span>Domestic Relations Court ordered the defendants to
withhold, the Court believes that since this amount has not yet been deposited
by the defendants with the said Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, the same
cannot as yet be considered as paid and plaintiff's liability to the said Court
still <span style="">remains.‚Äù</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the other amount claimed, the appealed decision goes
on to state:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"With respect to the
sum of P47,370.35, this Court has this to say:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that aside from the fact that the plaintiff vigorously denied this
indebtedness, the record shows that the only document evidencing it is a <span style="">promissory note <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<p class="BODY">The following observation of the lower court as to why it could
not believe the contention of <span class="GramE">defendants</span> bears
repeating:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Now, how can a document
like this bind the plaintiffs?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sum
of P47<span class="GramE">,370.35</span> is not a small amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if it were true that the plaintiff owed

herself?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the amount of P47,

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the light of the above, it cannot be said that the first
alleged seven errors were in fact committed by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, moreover, that the contentions

"In the more traditional terminology, the lower court judgment has in its
favor the presumption of correctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is entitled to great respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all,
the lower court had the opportunity of weighing carefully what was testified to
and apparently did not neglect it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no affront to justice then if its finding be accorded acceptance, subject of
course to the contingency of ultimate reversal if error or errors, substantial
in character, be shown in the conclusion thus arrived at. It is a fair
statement of the governing principle to say that the appellate function is
exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the result reached by
the trial court." <span class="GramE">From <span class="SpellE">Bulos</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>

"For one thing, what is objected to is not any alleged failure to apply
the law that is controlling but the lower court's appraisal of the decisive
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">an appreciation is primarily for the trial judge, who heard the witnesses
</span>testify and who was thus in a much better position to gauge their
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that <span style="">the conclusion </span>thus <span style="">arrived at is </span>to be considered
binding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would be <span class="GramE">recreant</span>
<span style="">to our </span>appellate task if such be
our attitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We are called upon, </span>however, in the absence of any taint of <span style="">arbitrariness or bias, </span>to yield to its
findings the presumption that <span style="">they were

deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A heavy burden </span>is <span style="">thus </span>placed
on the party who would have us <span style="">disregard
