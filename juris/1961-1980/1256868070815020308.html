				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for the review of a decision of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations, First Regional District, Hon. Pastor de Guzman, presiding, in CAR 
Cases Nos. 139-161-TP-'60 and 162-TP-'60 of said court. In CAR Cases Nos. 
139-161-TP-'60 the lower court dismissed the petitions filed; enjoined the 
parties to observe the sharing basis of 50-50 for the agricultural year 
1959-1960; divided in accordance with said sharing basis the palay deposited in 
the Moncada Rice Mill, Moncada, Tarlac, after deducting the seedlings which are 
to be returned to the landlord; ordered the Clerk of Court to deliver to 
petitioners-tenants the amount of P360.00, representing the cost of mongo 
harvested and deposited with the court. In CAR Case No. 162-TP-'60, the court 
ejected respondents-tenants from the land and authorized petitioner-landlord to 
appoint another set of tenants to work on said land.
<p>On January 22, 1960, Benito Estrada and several other tenants filed against 
their landlord, Dr. Faustino F. Galvan, individual petitions docketed as CAR 
Cases Nos. 139-161-TP-'60, the allegations of which petitions are similar. In 
their petitions, the tenants allege that they are tenants of repondent Galvan 
since 1952 on the latter's property located at Pinmalupod, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, 
cultivating several hectares each; that since the start the sharing observed by 
the parties in the palay produce has been on a 50-50 ratio, although they 
contributed all items of production, so that they are being short shared by 20% 
of the net produce every, agricultural year; that the sharing of the tobacco 
produce agreed upon by the parties and which is also the custom of the place, is 
2/3—1/3 in favor of petitioners, but that contrary thereto, respondent has 
divided the said produce on a 50-50 basis, thereby causing them a share 
dificiency of 16-2/3% that the 50% share of petitioners-tenants in the tobacco 
produce is given to them by respondent-landlord in cash computed at a price far 
below the market value; that the harvesting expenses of the tobacco produce are 
borne by the tenants; that the tobacco crop planted when the petitions were 
filed are ready for harvesting, but that respondent-landlord refused to allow 
them to harvest same; and that respondent ha3 never rendered a written 
accounting on any of the crop harvested. Petitioners-tenants, therefore, pray 
for a partition of the palay produce on a 70-30 basis, the tobacco produce, on a 
2/3—1/3 ratio of the net harvest, the mongo, on a 80-20 ratio of the net, all in 
favor of petitionerstenants. They also pray for an interlocutory order directing 
the harvesting of the tobacco produce under the court's supervision and that 
said harvest be placed in its custody.</p>
<p>In his answer filed on February 3, 1960, respondentlandholder, while denying 
for lack of information the other portions of the petitions, alleges that the 
sharing basis of the net harvest in all crops should be 50-50 because he 
supplied the farm implements, contributed P20.00 yearly per hectare for the 
expenses of transplanting and last harrowing, advanced the seedlings of said 
crops, supplied fertilizers, insecticides and other apparatus for use in the 
tobacco plantations, which conditions were embodied in their original contracts 
in 1951, which have never been changed.</p>
<p>On March 23, 1960, petitioners-tenants filed supplemental motions asking 
permission to harvest the mongo crop planted by them and that 
respondent-landlord be ordered to give them 80% of the net produce.</p>
<p>In turn respondent-landlord Dr. Faustino F. Galvan filed on April 11, 1961 a 
re-amended petition against all the tenants, petitioners herein, (docketed as 
CAR Case No. 162-TP-'60), wherein he is now petitioner while his tenants are 
respondents, praying for authority to eject all the respondents-tenants from 
their respective landholdings and for payment by them of damages and attorney's 
fees. The reasons alleged for the ejectment of the respondents are: their 
unjustified refusal to thresh the palay harvests of the 1959-60 agricultural 
year with the use of petitionerlandlord's threshing machine; their harvesting of 
matured tobacco leaves without reporting the amount of tobacco leaves harvested 
and their absconding with same; their employment of sub-tenants and the entry of 
said sub-tenants upon the land, without written consent and knowledge of the 
petitioner-landlord, to plant early variety of palay as second crop.</p>
<p>Respondents-tenants, in their answer, deny the material allegations of the 
petition and interpose as counterclaim their allegations contained in their 
petitions against the landlord in CAR Cases Nos. 139-161-TP-'60. These 
counterclaims were already answered in Dr. Galvan's answer to the petitions.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1960, petitioner Benito Estrada was, by reason of his death, 
substituted in CAR Case No. 139-TP-'60 by his wife and children.</p>
<p>The facts involved in all these cases being closely related, the lower court, 
upon agreement of the parties, tried all of them jointly, thereafter rendering 
only one decision for all.</p>
<p>In its decision, the lower court set forth in detail the testimonies of the 
witnesses for the parties and the documentary evidence submitted by them, and 
found that when the tenants were first taken in, they were required to sign 
contracts of tenancy with the landlord, wherein the sharing basis agreed upon 
was 50-50 on all crops; that said sharing is based on the customs of the place 
and said contracts have not yet been changed; that the landlord contributed 
expenses of last harrowing and transplanting, farm implements and seedlings in 
connection with the rice planted, and seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and 
apparatus, with the tobacco planted; that the share of the tenants on the 
tobacco produced was paid at a reasonable and current price of P0.08 per kilo; 
that the mongo were planted on upland portions not planted to rice but only to 
corn and mongo, so that said mongo is considered a principal crop and like the 
tobacco produce, should be divided on a 50-50 sharing basis; that the tenants 
are guilty of the violations charged in the petition filed by the landlord. 
Consequently, the court dismissed the petitions of the tenants and granted that 
of the landlord, ejecting the tenants from their landholdings. Hence, this 
petition for review by writ of certiorari.</p>
<p>The main object or purpose of the suit of petitioners before the respondent 
court is to secure for themselves a change in the crop sharing between them as 
tenants, on one side, and the respondent Dr. Galvan, on the other, not only as 
to the rice crop, but also as to the crops of tobacco, mongo and mangoes, and if 
such desired crop sharing be impossible of enforcement in the 1959-60 crop, then 
from the 1960-1961 crop. As the basis provided for by law for fixing the crop 
sharing in rice, are different in other crops, the question of crop sharing for 
the rice harvest will be considered separately.</p>
<p>The basis for the crop sharing of the rice harvest is fixed in Section 32 of 
the Agricultural Tenancy Act of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1199) in the 
following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 32. <i>Share Basis</i>.—The parties shall, on ricelands which produce a 
normal average of more than forty cavanes per hectare for the three agricultural 
years next preceding the current harvest, receive as shares in the gross 
produce, after setting aside the same amount of palay used as seeds, and after 
deducting the cost of fertilizer, pest and weed control, reaping and threshing, 
the amount corresponding to the total equivalent of their individual 
contributions, computed as follows:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The land cultivated by petitioners are admittedly first class lands, so the 
legal method of fixing the crop shares of the tenant and the landlord is as 
above set forth. The origin of Dr. Galvan's landholding and the original 
conditions of the land tenancy between him and his tenants-petitioners is 
described in the decision of the respondent judge as follows:</p>
<p>"The Court, however, after a eareful review of the said testimonies, of the 
witnesses, found the following facts: when the landholder Dr. Faustino F. Galvan 
petitioner in CAR Case No. 162-TP-'60, became such landholder in 1952, there 
were no tenants because all the tenants of said landholder which he got from his 
uncle Don Dionisio Galvan, were ejected upon a decision of the Supreme Court 
because the said landholder wanted to mechanize his farm. But when Dr. Galvan, 
the new landholder, assumed the landholdership of the said landholding, out of 
pity, he received the tenants—some of the petitioners in CAR Cases Nos. 
139-161-TP-'60. This testimony of Dr. Galvan has not been refuted or denied or 
thrown over-board by any of the petitioners-tenants. This witness said, some of 
the petitioners are not his tenants. There are four of them and these are: 
Brigido Sagurit, Pablo Gapuya, Felipe Cresencia and Mariano Alvaro.</p>
<p>"Before the tenants-petitioners were received as such, they were made to sign 
tenancy contracts which were exhibited as Exhibits "1", "1-A" to "1-S". The 
Court cannot therefore, entertain any doubts as to the truth of these assertions 
of the landholder because of its naturalness, its contents being the embodiment 
of the then custom of the place, especially in the sharing basis of 50-50.</p>
<p>"The question, however, now is, should the Court maintain as sharing basis 
for the last agricultural year the same basis as 50-50? The answer is 
affirmative. There has been no showing that the parties changed the same nor was 
it changed by the Court, so it has been carried on, according to the 
landholder-petitioner in CAR Case No. 162-TP-'60, up to the last agricultural 
harvest.</p>
<p>"It has not been changed because it has become the custom of the place up to 
the present and why should the Court not maintain the same sharing basis when 
there is no reason for it to disregard or not to maintain it. It has been shown 
to the satisfaction of the Court that the landholder contributed expenses for 
last harrowing and transplanting. This fact is admitted by the 
petitionerstenants thru counsel. He also furnished farm implements and also 
seedlings. From these contributions of the landholder he should be entitled to 
52.5% but his generosity to these tenants could be seen by giving up the 2.5% in 
their favor and the Court should not question this because it favors the tenant. 
Exhibits "2", "2-A" to "2-A-A" are admitted in so far it tends to prove that the 
seedlings and the expenses for last harrowing and transplanting expenses are 
concerned were furnished by the landholder." (Decision, pp. 
64-65)</p></blockquote>
<p>The above findings of the respondent judge were arrived at after a careful 
review of the testimonies of witnesses for petitioners and of those of 
respondent landholder. The statements of the witnesses are embodied in more or 
less complete form in the decision and we find that the court's findings of fact 
and conclusions are fully justified by such evidence. Thus petitioners admit 
that the 50-50 sharing basis began from the year 1952 when respondent Dr. Galvan 
became the lessee landholder; that in the beginning written contracts fixing the 
50-50 sharing basis were entered into, and such basis had become the custom of 
the place.</p>
<p>The evidence, especially for the respondent landholder, shows that when the 
tenants started as such on the land they were provided by Dr. Galvan with the 
necessary farm implements, like plows, harrows, sledges, etc., although 
witnesses for petitioners claim they paid for their own implements or made the 
implements themselves. This claim of the tenants the court refused to believe, 
in view of the positive testimony of Dr. Galvan and his overseer, and the 
doubtful testimonies of witnesses for petitioners. The landholder had always 
been furnishing the seeds. The seeds, when the tenants came in for the first 
time, were furnished by Dr. Galvan; in subsequent years, a portion of the 
harvest was set aside as seed, which was always deposited in the <i>camarin</i> 
of Dr. Galvan.</p>
<p>The landholder also furnished each tenant the sum of P20.00 per hectare, as 
his (landholder) share in the expenses of last harrowing and transplanting. Some 
sample receipts of the accounts of tenants were shown to the court as Exhibits 
"2", "2-A" to "2-A-A" properly identified by the overseer. These receipts showed 
that P20.00 was furnished the tenant for each hectare, as the share of the 
landholder in the expenses of last harrowing and transplanting. This evidence 
has not been categorically or seriously contradicted.</p>
<p>Some samples of the contracts with tenants were also shown, Exhibits "1", 
"1-A" to "1-S", and these showed the terms of the agreement of a 50-50 crop 
sharing basis on condition that the landholder furnish the seeds, the 
implements, the P20.00 per hectare as share of landlord in the last harrowing 
and transplanting expenses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that the basis has been 50-50 since 1952, which basis 
continued for seven years without protest of any form or kind, and considering 
that the petitioners must have been aware of the law, they would not have 
consented to the 50-50 sharing basis, unless the landholder did actually furnish 
the seeds, the farm implements, and one half of the expenses of last harrowing 
and transplanting. The findings of the trial court as to these facts are, 
therefore, in accord with the probabilities of the case ad well as with the 
preponderance of the evidence adduced at the trial. Said findings, clearly 
supported by the evidence, are binding on this Court on this petition for 
review. We are therefore constrained to affirm the decision of the lower court 
and we dismiss, in consequence, the petition that the crop sharing basis for the 
rice crop be changed to 70-30 basis.</p>
<p>But it is contended that if the petition could not be granted as to the main 
rice crop for 1959-1960, at least it should be as to the second crop of some 
petitioners, which crop was planted early in March 1960 and harvested in late 
May and early June. Evidently petitioners are relying on the provision of 
section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act, as amended, to the effect that if 
the tenancy contract is not in writing the right of the tenant to change the 
contract of tenancy from one crop sharing arrangement to another may be 
exercised at least one month before the agricultural year, when the change shall 
be effected. (The petitions are dated in the month of January, 1960). In answer 
to this claim it must be stated that a change in the crop sharing agreement can 
not be made by the tenant unless he uses his own farm implements, uses his own 
carabao, and spends for the last harrowing and transplanting without any 
contribution or help from the landholder. There is no sufficient proof that the 
tenants have complied with this requirement, as we have found that the 
landholder owned the farm implements and contributed P20.00 per hectare for last 
harrowing and transplanting, hence the petition for the change to be effective 
as to the March-May crop must also be denied.</p>
<p>The next issue raised in the petition refers to the method in which the mongo 
crop should be shared between the landholder and the tenant. The court below 
found the following facts with respect to the place where the mongo is planted; 
it decided the issue of crop sharing, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We now come to the mongo. The mongo planted' were planted not on the field 
where the late variety is planted but in the "bankag" where they used to plant 
corn or mongo, sometimes the early variety. The evidence also shows that the 
said mongo has never been planted in the rice fields where the late variety of 
palay is planted, otherwise it becomes a second crop harvest. All the witnesses 
testified that the mongo were planted in the upland portion of their 
landholding. This also explains that not all the petitioners-tenants planted 
mongo because not all of them have upland portion of their landholding. <i>This 
should therefore be divided as principal product and it has been shown that the 
landholder furnished the seedlings like in palay and so with farm implements and 
the sharing should be 50-50 because there is no expense for last harrowing nor 
transplanting. The work of the tenants is only to plant and to take care of the 
plants. Harvesting is paid from the gross</i>." (p. 10 of 
Petition)</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioners contend that the rule that should apply is section 30 of Republic 
Act No. 1199, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 30. <i>Auxiliary Crop</i>.—In case the land is planted to an auxiliary 
crop, the tenant shall receive eighty per centum and the landholder twenty per 
centum of the net produce, provided all expenses of production are borne by the 
tenant.</p>
<p>"Auxiliary crops shall not, however, be construed to include the crops or 
products raised from the garden, poultry and other industries carried on the lot 
specifically provided for the tenant under Section 26 (a) 
hereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>The contention of the petitioners cannot be sustained and the ruling of the 
court below must be upheld. "Bankag" is not planted to rice but only vegetables 
either during the rainy season or soon after when the harvest season begins. The 
mongo was planted by petitioners as a principal crop, not as auxiliary crop. 
Therefore the provisions of section 30 of Republic Act No. 1199 are not 
applicable. The mongo should, therefore, be considered as "crop other than rice" 
as defined in section 41 of the said Act, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 41. <i>Basis of Shares in crops other than Rice</i>.—The landholder and 
the tenant on lands which produce crops other than rice shall be free to enter 
into any contract stipulating the ratio of crop division. In the absence of a 
stipulation, the customs of the place shall govern: Provided, That whether the 
basis of division of the crop is the contract between the parties or the customs 
of the place, the share of the tenant for his labor in the production shall not 
be less than thirty per cent of the harvest or produce, after deducting the 
expenses for harvesting and/or initial processing: <i>Provided, further</i>, 
That in cases where the share of the tenant is, according to local practices or 
customs prevailing at the time of the approval of this Act, more than the 
minimum herein set, the tenant's share thus established by local practices or 
customs shall prevail and be considered the minimum."</p></blockquote>The 
evidence submitted at the trial is to the effect that even the mongo crop was 
raised on the "bankag" (land not planted to rice) and was divided on the 50-50 
basis, in accordance with the old established customs and practices in the 
locality. The ruling of the court below should, therefore, be confirmed.

<p>The last question posed by petitioners refers to the method in which the 
tobacco crop is to be shared, petitioners claiming that it should be on the 
70-30 basis instead of the 50-50 which had been followed since 1952 when they 
entered the land as tenants. On this issue the respondent judge made the 
following findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As to the tobacco, the evidence shows that the landholder furnished all the 
seeds; he furnished fertilizers and insecticides for the seed beds; insecticides 
for all the plants but half of the cost is to be borne by the tenants and 1/2 
for the landholder; he also furnished free of charge, apparatus for spraying and 
sticks. All what the tenant should do is to plant and to take care of the 
transplanted seedlings and the gathering of the leaves.</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as it was their contract to divide the green leaves 60-50 and the 
said contract is not contrary to law, morals or public policy, the same should 
be up-held by the Court." (pp. 67-68, Decision)</p></blockquote>
<p>The evidence, therefore, shows that the tobacco is grown as a principal crop 
and on a commercial basis, not in small patches on the land near the house of 
the tenant and for the latter's use only, in accordance with section 26 of the 
Agricultural Tenancy Act. The provision of the law which govern the crop sharing 
is also section 41, <i>supra</i> which provides that the crop sharing shall be 
<i>in accordance with the contract</i>, and in the absence thereof <i>according 
to the customs of the place</i>. When the petitioners entered the land, the crop 
sharing adopted was the 50-50 basis, and this basis had continued to the date of 
filing of the action and has become the custom of the place. Section 41 of the 
law fixes 30% as the minimum that the tenant is entitled to receive. Considering 
that it is the right of the landlord to be reimbursed the seeds and the cost of 
fertilizer and insecticides, as provided in section 28 of the law, and the fact 
that these are not deducted from the gross selling price of the tobacco crop, 
the tenants certainly have no reason or ground to protest against the 50-50 
basis adopted.</p>
<p>The claim of petitioners that the 70-30 basis should also be adopted in the 
division of the tobacco crop should, therefore, be also dismissed.</p>
<p>With respect to the petition of the landholder that his tenants should be 
ejected because of violations committed by them, the court below found that 
petitioners (1) gathered or harvested tobacco leaves and flue-cured the same in 
a barn not of the landlord, without the landlord's knowledge and consent, and 
withdut giving him his share; (2) did not plant palay in their upland holdings 
after their tobacco harvest, planting corn instead, in violation of the 
landholder's orders and instructions; (3) sundried their tobacco instead of 
flue-curing them, against expressorders of the landholder; (4) some employed 
sub-tenants without the consent or knowledge of the landholder.</p>
<p>We note that at the time of the trial the respondent judge, asked petitioners 
for their views on a possible settlement, but petitioners stated that their 
relations with the respondent were already strained, meaning they were loathsome 
to go back under the old crop sharing basis (of 50-50). They expressed a feelmg 
that they would not be satisfied unless the basis he changed to that of 70-30. 
But it does not appear that they have ever expressed willingness to waive the 
contribution that the landholder gave for the expenses of last harrowing and 
transplanting. There is, therefore, no other course to take but to decide the 
case strictly on its merits.</p>
<p>In view of all the findings and circumstances, as above set forth, we are 
constrained to uphold the resolution of the court ordering their ejectment.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, the petitions in G. R. Nos. L-17481 and L-17537-59, 
for the review of the decision of the respondent court, are hereby denied and 
its decision in all cases affirmed. Without costs.</p>

<p><b>LABRADOR, J.:</b></p>
<p>In an order of the court promulgated on August 15, 1961, we directed the 
manager or the owner of the Moncada Bonded Warehouse in Moncada, Tarlac and 
respondent Faustino F. Galvan to release and deliver to petitioners Liberata 
Antonio Estrada, et al., the portions still remaining to be delivered to them in 
their shares of the palay in these cases, i.e., (a) 10% of the net produce of 
the first crop minus P300 and (b) 15% of the net produce of the second crop 
minus P200. On January 21, 1962, counsel for petitioners Liberata Aiitonio 
Estrada, et al., filed a motion asking that Faustino F. Galvan and the owner or 
manager of the Moncada Bonded Warehouse at Moncada, Tarlac be punished for 
contempt for failure to deliver the shares of the petitioners in the harvest as 
specified in the preceding order of the court. Respondent Faustino Galvan 
opposed the motion alleging that the order of the court had already been 
complied with by delivery of certain specified quantities of palay to the 
petitioners. On August 14, 1962, counsel! for the petitioners filed before us a 
manifestation claiming that respondents Galvan and the owner or manager of the 
Moncada Bonded Warehouse have not delivered the exact amount to which the 
petitioners are entitled under the previous resolution of this Court. 
Considering that the issues raised in the motion to declare the respondents in 
contempt and the opposition thereto involve questions of fact, i.e., the 
determination of whether the respective shares of petitioners and the respondent 
have actually been delivered, copies of the papers already mentioned above are 
hereby referred to the Honorable Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations 
presiding at Moncada, Tarlac, to receive the evidence that the petitioners and 
the respondents may offer in support of their respective claims and contentions. 
Said court is hereby ordered to conduct the necessary hearing and make its 
report and recommendation within ninety (90) days from receipt of this 
order.</p>
