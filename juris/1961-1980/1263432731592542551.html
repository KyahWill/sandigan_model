				<H3>ASSOCIATED TRADE UNIONS-ATU (ATU–KILUSAN), PETITIONER, VS. HON. CARMELO C. NORIEL, IN HIS CAPACITY AS DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR RELATIONS, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, FEDERATION OF UNIONS OF RIZAL (FUR), R.B. ENTERPRISES AND R.B. STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This Court has repeatedly been on record as favoring the holding
of a certification election as the most democratic means of determining which
labor association should be the exclusive bargaining agent, thus effectively
implementing the clear policy of the New Labor Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, in appropriate cases, on a showing that there is in existence a
collective bargaining contract duly certified, there is a legal obstacle to its
taking place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is on that premise that
this <i>certiorari</i> petition is based, the allegation being that respondent
Director <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>
acted in violation of the due process guarantee in disregarding what it alleged
are proven and uncontested facts as to the existence of a certified collective
bargaining contract and thus acted at the very least with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plausibility of the
petition was bolstered by the inclusion of four annexes, apparently justifying
its contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was a certification of the collective bargaining contract of the employer<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
with petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other two consisted of the dismissal of the petition for certification<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
of respondent Federation Unions of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (FUR) and
the denial by respondent Director of a Motion for Reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
More specifically, there is an allegation of arbitrariness, for according to
petitioner there was unaccountably and unjustifiably a reversal of the decision
reached by respondent Director in denying the plea for the holding of a
certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be precise,
on <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1977</st1:date>, he ordered
that such election be held.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, a restraining order was issued by this Court, and respondents were
required to comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comment of
Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
on behalf of respondent Director <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> clarified
matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stressed that one month
before the application by petitioner for the certification of the collective
bargaining contract, there was a pending petition for certification election
filed by respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and that when the collective
bargaining contract was certified, it had not been as yet decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even its dismissal was provisional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, "petitioner in requesting for
the certification of said collective bargaining agreement failed to inform the
Bureau that there was a pending petition for certification election in the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had said fact been disclosed to
the Bureau, the latter could not have certified the aforementioned collective
bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly pointed
out by public respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> in the assailed order
of <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1977</st1:date>, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'ATU, in requesting that the
agreement be certified, should have volunteered the information that there is a
pending petition for certification election at the contracting company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it chose to conceal this very
important fact from the Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had ATU
dealt with the Bureau with candor, the matter should not have become muddled by
the subsequent certification of the CBA.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It cannot be said, therefore, in the light of the above facts, that the
actuation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> is susceptible to the
charge of arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No due process
question arises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must fail.</p>

<blockquote>1. It should occasion no surprise if a labor organization in the
position of petitioner would take steps to continue as the collective
bargaining representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is an
aspect of the competitive struggle between unions for supremacy in a collective
bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
ought to have realized that whatever step it took should be in conformity with
and not in defiance of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
above facts, it is quite apparent that it was unmindful of such a basic
principle so essential to the maintenance of the rule of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent labor Union on the other hand was
guided by and, therefore, acted in accordance with the applicable provision of
the Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No certification election issue shall
be entertained by the Bureau in any collective bargaining unit if a certified
collective bargaining agreement exists between the employer and a legitimate
labor organization, except within sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of
the life of such certified collective bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The organization receiving the majority of
the votes cast in such election shall be certified by the Bureau as the
exclusive bargaining representative of the employees concerned."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor could any question be raised as to the petition for certification by respondent
labor Union being supported by the written consent of 30% of all the employees
in the bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case,
the law makes it mandatory for respondent Director to order that certification
election be held.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
That is what was done by respondent Director.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To repeat, no arbitrariness had been shown or could be imputed to
respondent Director.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court has ever
been alert against such attempts at circumventing the clear statutory policy to
conduct a certification election as the most appropriate means of ascertaining
which labor organization should be the exclusive bargaining representative by
collective contracts concluded under the circumstances present in this
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first case cited in
this opinion, Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions v. Bureau of Labor
Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court did not consider a duly certified collective bargaining contract as
a bar to a certification election when it was shown that it was entered into
pending an appeal against an earlier rejection of the plea for certification by
respondent union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In General Textiles
Allied Workers Association v. Director of Bureau of Labor Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court dismissed a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding by petitioner labor union
assailing an order of respondent Director to call a certification election on
the plea that there was a previous renewal of collective bargaining
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference may likewise be made
to Vassar Industries Employees Union v. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was alleged that the management subsequently entered into a collective
bargaining agreement with respondent labor organization, a contract approved
and ratified by the general membership or employees of such firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, it did not suffice to nullify an
order requiring that a certification election be held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is relevance to this excerpt from the
opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"With a pending petition
for certification, any such agreement entered into by management with a labor
organization is fraught with the risk that such a labor union may not be chosen
thereafter as the collective bargaining representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the situation that is confronted by
private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other view
would render nugatory the clear statutory policy to favor certification
election as the means of ascertaining a true expression of the will of the
workers as to which labor organization would represent them."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
So it must be in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last point to be
considered is the legal effect, if any, of the certified collective bargaining
contract prior to the holding of the certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, this is not the first time this
question had confronted this Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latest case in point, National Mines and Allied Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
v. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>supplies the guiding principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was set forth with clarity in the opinion
of Justice Antonio thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It also
appears that after the expiration of the existing Collective Bargaining
Agreement, or on March 31, 1976, the company and respondent Union executed a
new Collective Bargaining Agreement incorporating all the conditions imposed by
the decision of the Labor Arbiter of May 12, 1976 in the compulsory arbitration
case (No. RB-IV-4138-76) to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) a
wage increase of P1.04 a day per man; and (2) incentive for assay workers in
the amount of P21,280.00 a year, and providing that the Collective Bargaining
Agreement shall be for a period of three (3) years effective on the date of its
execution, but the wage increase should be retroactive to the day immediately
following the expiration of the 1972 agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is claimed this Collective Bargaining Agreement has much more
favorable terms than the previous agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This agreement should be enforced in the meantime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a union, other than the one that executed
the agreement, should be certified, then such union shall negotiate with
management for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Then came this citation]:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'* * * we are not unmindful that he
supplemental collective bargaining contract entered into in the meanwhile
between management and respondent Union contains provisions beneficial to
labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So as not to prejudice the
workers involved, it must be made clear that until the conclusion of a new
collective bargaining contract entered into by it and whatever labor
organization may be chosen after the certification election, the existing
collective labor contract as thus supplemented should be left undisturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its terms call for strict compliance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This mode of assuring that the cause of labor
suffers no injury from the struggle between contending labor organizations follows
the doctrine announced in the recent case of Vassar Industries Employees Union
v. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> (L-46562, March 31, 1978).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the meanwhile, if as contended by
private respondent labor union the interim collective bargaining agreement,
which it engineered and entered into on September 26, 1977, has much more
favorable terms for the workers of private respondent Vassar Industries, then
it should continue in full force and effect until the appropriate bargaining
representative is chosen and negotiations for a new collective bargaining
agreement thereafter concluded." ' "<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
On the assumption then that the stipulations in the certified collective
bargaining agreement in this case are more advantageous to the laborers, then
it must, in the meanwhile, be observed and maintained until the certification
election is conducted, the collective bargaining representative chosen, and the
collective bargaining contract concluded.</blockquote>
