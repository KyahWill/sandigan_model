				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> were charged with the crime of murder, to which they
all pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the trial
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>, and, after him, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the trial proceeded with respect to the other three de足fendants,
and upon its conclusion the court found <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>
guilty as charged and sen足tenced each of them to suffer the penalty of
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, with all the accessories of the
law; to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span> in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, however, acquitted <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> for
insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence shows that <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, a former Philippine army soldier, had for years
lived in the town of <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
with his common-law wife, <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>, with whom he had several children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For undisclosed reasons, he later abandoned
them, went to Manila and there married another woman.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 8, 1960, he returned to <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>
on vacation and stayed in the house of his brother, Esteban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While visiting a certain Carmen Navarro in
barrio Santa Rosa of the same town, he met <span class="SpellE">Raymunda's</span>
brothers, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>,
and a heated discussion ensued between him and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
concerning the sale by him of a parcel of land belonging to <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The barrio lieutenant and a municipal
councilor, however, intervened and pacified them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 13, 1960, upon invitation of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> attended a party
held in the latter's house in honor of his son, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>,
who had returned home with his family after a six-year service in the
Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among those present at the affair
were <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> and
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the party was in progress, the matter of the sale by <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> of the property of his former common-law wife
cropped up again, leading to another heated discussion between <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course thereof <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> took hold of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>,
while Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> clubbed him with a piece of
bamboo, and later, although he was able to free himself from <span class="SpellE">Romulo's</span> grasp, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> was
stabbed by Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
rushed to the backdoor to escape from his aggressors, but he was chased by <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, Manuel and Oscar, and then, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> not only blocked his way but also stabbed him.</p>

<p class="BODY">About <st1:time hour="0" minute="0">midnight</st1:time> of the
same evening, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>
surrendered to the authorities, to whom he surrendered a long-pointed
bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>, the Municipal Health Officer and several policemen
pro足ceeded to the house of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival thereat, the Chief of Police
asked the latter for the whereabouts of the body of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
and, as the latter remained silent, said officer ordered the place
searched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the aid of flashlights,
they found <span class="SpellE">Basilio's</span> body under the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Constabulary soldiers who conducted an on-the-spot investigation
found a bolo tucked at the wall of the house and the broken arm of a chair with
blood stains, thrown in the stocks of wood below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of a statement made by <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> that he had
accidentally wounded Oscar during the fight, they proceeded to the house of the
latter where they found him really suffering from a wound in the abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bolo was also found hanging on the wall of
his house, and in the "<span class="SpellE">batalan</span>" they found
a "<span class="SpellE">batia</span>" (basin) containing clothes with
bloodstains, soaked <span style="">in </span>water.</p>

<p class="BODY">The post-mortem examination of the cadaver, made by Dr. Unite,
the Health Officer, showed that the deceased had suffered eight (8) wounds in
different parts of his body, most of which were gaping stab wounds which caused
his death (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>
admitted having killed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
but claimed to have done so both in self-defense and <span style="">in </span>defense of the honor of his sister, <span class="SpellE">Florfina</span>,
who in the middle of the night screamed when she was allegedly criminally
assaulted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection <span style="">he claimed </span>that
when he was awakened and he stood up to help his sister, a struggle ensued
between him and the latter's attacker for the possession of the bolo he (<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>) was holding and that <span style="">in </span>the course thereof he was able to stab his opponent, who
turned out to be <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rey</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span>view of this
admission it was incumbent upon him to establish his defense by clear and
convincing evidence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Borbano</span> 76 Phil. 702;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ansoyon</span> 75 Phil. 772). In this, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, he utterly failed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, his story about the struggle for the
possession of his bolo stands uncorroborated, and the fact that he came out of
it completely unscathed makes it highly suspicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, the different locations
of the eight (8) wounds suffered by the deceased - one <span style="">on </span>the back, another <span style="">on </span>the
left leg and other parts of the body (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K) - tally
with the prosecution's version that <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> was not the only one who attacked the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the third place, it <span style="">is </span>improbable,
if not downright incredible, that <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> would try to criminally assault <span class="SpellE">Florfina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> while the latter was asleep in a small
room with several other persons, including <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
himself, his wife and his child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, this part of <span class="SpellE">Romulo's</span> story is
rendered more incredible by the established fact that there was a lighted
kerosene lamp in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, his
testimony <span style="">is
</span>completely destroyed by that of his own sister, <span class="SpellE">Florfina</span>,
the alleged victim of the mid足night criminal assault, who denied that <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> had ever made any attempt against her honor; <span style="">she </span>said
too, that she was awakened that evening not because <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>,
as claimed by her brother, had attempted to abuse her but by the discussion
between <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other parts of her testimony described fully
how appellants and other persons had ganged up on <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span> that night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the record discloses nothing that would <span style="">make </span><span class="SpellE">Florfina's</span>
testimony against her own brother incredible, we must assume that she told the
truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>true, of course, that she had signed the sworn statement <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1 the day after <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> was killed but, according to her testimony, she did so
upon instigation and instruction of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other appellant, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>,
relies merely upon an alibi claiming that after taking supper at his father's
house on the night of <st1:date month="11" day="13" year="1960">November 13,
 1960</st1:date>, he went home to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This defense cannot stand in the face of evidence positively identifying
him as one of several persons who attacked <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> under the circumstances established by the prosecution
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Florfina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span> positively identified him as one of those
who stabbed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, and this witness could not have
been mistaken about this because she knew him very well per足sonally.</p>

<p class="BODY">Premises considered we find that both appellants are guilty of
having attacked and wounded <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> on the evening of <st1:date month="11" day="13" year="1960">November 13, 1960</st1:date>, in the house of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> in barrio <st1:city><st1:place>Santa Rosa</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iguig</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>pro足vince</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find, however, that the crime committed
was not murder but only homicide, because while it is true that Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>, one of the two defendants who died while the case
was pending below, attacked <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> treacherously with a piece of bamboo while the latter
was held defenseless by <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>,
there is no sufficient evidence to establish conspiracy between them nor to
prove that <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> took hold of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span> precisely for the purpose of giving Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> an opportunity to club him with a piece of
bamboo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is also true that,
later on, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> rushed to the back door to escape
his attackers chased by <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>,
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>,
the evidence fails to disclose that herein appellants were in conspiracy with
the now deceased Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span> when the latter blocked
the escape route and then stabbed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> with a
knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the evidence it would seem
that the initial attack as well as the sub足sequent ones were not premeditated
but were due mainly, if not exclusively, to the heat generated by the
discussion between the deceased and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, in the imposition of the penalty pro足vided by law -
reclusion temporal - (Article 249, Revised Penal Code) the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender should be considered in favor of appellant <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garcellano</span>, this requiring
the imposition there足of in its minimum degree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applying to him the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he is,
therefore, sentenced to suffer eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor, as minimum, and twelve (12) years and one
(1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of the other appellant, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Sedano</span>,
the penalty provided by law should be imposed in its medium degree, in the
absence of any modifying cir足cumstance to consider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, applying to him likewise the benefits
of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he is hereby sentenced to suffer an
indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
mayor, as minimum, and fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of
reclusion temporal, as maximum.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS,</b> the decision appealed from is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
