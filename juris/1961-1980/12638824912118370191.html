				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal by the Solicitor General on behalf <span style="">of </span>respondents-appellants from the
decision of <span style="">the </span>Court of First
Instance of Manila, dated February 17, 1965, in Civil Case No. 57471, declaring
respondents-appellants to have acted <span style="">"with
</span>grave abuse of discretion in denying the proper permit and license to
petitioner to hold or conduct horse racing on June 24, 1964 at the San Lazaro
Hippodrome located at No. 2000 <span style="">Felix H</span>uertas
St., Manila; and declaring all acts and proceedings had in connection therewith
by the respondents, null and void."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">June 18, 1964,
petitioner-appellee Manila Jockey Club, lnc., through </span>its <span style="">Manager Francisco </span>Beech, filed with
the Games and Amusements Board an application for a permit to hold or conduct
horse racing on Wednesday, June 24, 1964, because this date was declared as a
Special Public Holiday in <span style="">the City of
Manila on the occasion of "Araw ng Maynila" or Manila Foundation Day
by Presidential Proclamation No. 257, dated June 8, 1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Games and Amusements
Board, composed of respondent Justiniano N. Montano, as Chairman, and
respondents Alfredo Lozano and Jose Roxas, as Members, refused to issue the
corresponding license to petitioner-appellee, in </span>view <span style="">of the letter dated June 18, 1964, copy of
whish was furnished to petitioner-appellee, of the then Acting Executive Secretary,
respondent Calixto </span>O. Zaidivar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In reply to the query of said Board on June
17, 1964 as to whether horse races may he held at the Manila Jockey Club on
June 24, 1964, the Acting Executive Secretary informed the Board that "in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of Republic Act No. 309, as amended
by Republic Act No. 983, horse races may</span>, <span style="">be held only </span>on <i>legal</i><i><span style=""> </span>holidays</i> <span style="">prescribed
by law for the whole country, except Holy Thursday, Holy Friday, July fourth
and December thirtieth, and not </span>on a <i>special public holiday</i><span style=""> </span>for a particular district, province
or city" and that the "Manila Jockey Club may not, therefore; hold
races in Manila on June 24, 1964."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 23, 1964,
petitioner-appellee, not sat</span>isfied with the action taken, filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary mandatory injunction with the
Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XX, as Civil Case No. 57471,
contending, among others, that petitioner is lawfully entitled to the issuance
of the necessary permit and license to hold or conduct horse racing on
Wednesday, June 24, 1964, at the San Lazaro Hippodrome, under the provisions of
Section 4 of Republic Act No. 309, as amended by Republic Act No. 2325, as by
Proclamation No. 257 of the President of the Republic of the Philippines, dated
June 8, 1964, the date, June 24, 1964, has been declared <span style="">a </span>Special Public Holiday in the City of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then prayed, among
others, that a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction be <span style="">issued <i>ex parte</i>; ordering the
respondents-appel</span>lants, their agents, representatives and assigns, to
issue the necessary permit and license to peti­tioner-appellee to hold or
conduct horse racing on June 24, 1964 at the aforesaid San Lazaro Hippo­drome;
and further ordering them to cease and desist from preventing or stopping
petitioner from holding or conducting horse races on June 24, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="6">June
 23, 1964</st1:date>, the lower court issued the writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction, after the filing and approval of a bond in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents-appellants filed their answers on July 14 and 20,
1964, and thereafter, the case was set for pre-trial on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1964</st1:date>, and on this date the parties
agreed to submit the case for decision on the pleading and on their memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1965</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered its afore-mentioned decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the respondents-appellants interposed
the present appeal contending, among others, that the lower court erred in
holding that "Manila Foundation Day", a Special Public Holiday only
in the City of Manila, is a legal holiday within the purview of Section 4 of
Republic Act No. 309, as amended, during which horse racing may be authorized.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the purpose of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> with
preliminary mandatory injunction filed by the petitioner-appellee is to compel
the Games and Amusements Board to issue to petitioner-appellee the necessary
permit and license to hold or conduct horse racing on a particular date - June
24, 1964 - <span style="">at the San Lazaro Hippodrome
which is long past and considering that Republic Act No. 309 on the basis </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">which the suit was instituted has been repealed by Presidential Decree
No. 420, promulgated on March 20, 1974, abolishing the Games and Amusements
Board and treating the Philippine Racing Commission with broader powers, the
issue raised in the petition has, therefore, now become moot and academic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the present appeal should be, as set is
hereby, DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as
to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Fernando, (Chairman), Barredo, Aquino,<span style="font-style: normal;"> and </span>Concepcion, Jr., <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
