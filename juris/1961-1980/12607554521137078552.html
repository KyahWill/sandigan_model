				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Apolonio (<i>alias</i> Sofronio) Andia, with his brothers Ciriaco, Restituto 
and Iniego, were charged in the Court of First Instance of Samar with the 
killing of Jaime Lucana, a policeman of Borongan, Samar, where the crime took 
place. After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment on November 18, 
1958, convicting accused Apolonio Andia of murder, and sentencing him to suffer 
the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with its accessory penalties, to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased victim in the amount of P6,000 and to pay ¼ 
of the costs. The other accused were acquitted for insufficiency of evidence. 
Hence, this appeal by Apolonio Andia from the verdict of conviction.
<p>The evidence is to the effect that at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of 
August 25, 1957, Ciriaco Andia bought P0.20 worth of <i>tuba from</i> Felipa de 
Amoyo at the latter's store in the public market of Borongan, Samar. Refusing to 
pay for his drink, Ciriaco was reported to Jaime Lucana, a town policeman; but 
despite the latter's intercession, Ciriaco still would not settle his account 
with the storeowner. A heated discussion ensued between Jaime and Iniego Andia, 
a brother of Ciriaco, until finally, policeman Lucana, evidently irked by the 
belligerent attitude of Iniego, told the latter that he was under arrest. The 
two brothers then took hold and tried to overpower the policeman; and not long 
afterwards, Restituto Andia arrived and joined his brothers in manhandling 
Lucana. While the latter was struggling to free himself from the hold of the 
trio, Sgt. Crispin Afable arrived and tried to rescue his comrade-at-arms. 
Iniego pushed back the sergeant, causing the latter to fall to his knees. Afable 
took out his service pistol and with it hit Iniego on the forehead. Suddenly, a 
woman from among the crowd that had already gathered at the time shouted, "You 
watch out; there is a person who has a weapon" Hearing this, Afable backed a 
short distance away from the struggling man and focusing his flashlight at the 
intruder, he saw Apolonio Andia holding a knife. Afable ordered him to drop the 
weapon, but Apolonio instead ran away, whereupon the sergeant gave chase. 
Apolonio easily eluded his pursuer inside the crowded market, and seconds later, 
reappeared at the scene of the crime. Immediately, he stabbed Lucana while the 
latter was still being held by Iniego, Ciriaco and Restituto. Thereafter, the 
four brothers scurried off.</p>
<p>Brought to the Borongan Emergency Hospital, Lucana was administered first aid 
by Dr. Jorge Bocar. Before he was operated on, however, Leonardo Solidon, the 
local justice of the peace, took Lucana's statement (Exhibit "E"). After about 
two hours later, the patient died while still on the operating table.</p>
<p>According to the medical certificate issued by Dr. Bocar, death of Lucana was 
due to hemorrhage caused by multiple wounds that cut the small intestines 
(Exhibit "A").</p>
<p>The foregoing narration of the incident is the result of the unbiased account 
of the People's witnesses Alberto Abenia and Julio Bocal, who both saw the 
actual slaying, corroborated by Crispin Afable, Felipa de Amoyo and Aida Amoyo. 
Leonardo Solidon, who took the <i>ante mortem</i> declaration of the victim, and 
Dr. Jorge Bocar, who performed an operation on Lucana, issued the medical 
certificate, Exhibit "A", attested to Lucana's dying declaration.</p>
<p>Counsel <i>de oficio</i> urges that the lower court should have given more 
credence to the testimony of accused's witnesses, in the main to the effect that 
it was Iniego who in self-defense delivered the fatal thrust to Lucana. This 
version must be rejected. The defense could not furnish any ulterior motive on 
the part of the State witnesses that would prompt them to perjure against the 
appellant or implicate him. Alberto Abenis, who knew appellant for a long time, 
testified that he was only about a meter away from the scene of the stabbing, 
and that he distinctly saw appellant chased by Sergeant Crispin Afable and 
witnessed how half a minute later he returned and stabbed Lucana while the 
latter was being held by his brothers Ciriaco, Restituto and Iniego. Julio Bocal 
attested to the same thing. The candor of the witness is shown by his admission 
that in retaliation for the brothers' unjustified attack on Lucana, he stabbed 
Iniego Andia with a small knife while the latter was trying to get hold of the 
fallen policeman's club.</p>
<p>There is also the dying declaration of Jaime Lucana himself in answer to 
questions propounded by Justice of the Peace Leonardo Solidon. Thus, Dr. Jorge 
Bocar testified in this regard:</p>

<p>Judge Leonardo Solidon testified to having asked those questions and taken 
down the answers in writing; and while the writing itself is inadmissible in 
evidence, since it was not read by declarant or read to him by another and is 
not signed or in any way acknowledged by him after it was written, the testimony 
of Dr. Bocar, as corroborated by Solidon, suffices to establish the dying 
declaration. It is argued that no evidence was offered to show that Lucana was 
conscious of impending death when he made his <i>ante mortem</i> statement; but 
the character and seriousness of the wound and the fact that death supervened 
shortly afterwards may be considered as circumstantial evidence of such 
consciousness (People <i>vs</i>. Chan, 50 Phil., 182).</p>
<p>In the face of the evidence, particularly the positive declaration of 
eye-witnesses who saw appellant's participation in the crime, we can not accept 
Apolonio's defense of <i>alibi</i>, supported only by his wife Iluminada Andia, 
who asserted that this appellant arrived at their house (three kilometers away 
from the site of the crime) at 5:30 p.m. and that they went to sleep side by 
side between 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. Witness Obina merely stated that she did not see 
him at the site of the fray; and so did defense witnesses Badiola and 
Bengson.</p>
<p>Iniego's confession that he stabbed Jaime Lucana is not surprising, 
considering that he was in a better position to claim self-defense, at the same 
time saving his brother Apolonio from lawful punishment for his felonious deed. 
This afterthought cannot be seriously considered as raising reasonable doubt on 
appellant's guilt.</p>
<p>The defense contends that the offense could not be murder, as the qualifying 
circumstance of treachery did not exist, because it was not present at the 
inception of the assault, and the aggression was continuous until the 
consummation of the deed, citing, <i>inter alia</i>, People <i>vs</i>. Cañete, 
44 Phil., 478; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Cunanan, 37 Phil., 777; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Gray, 4 
Phil., 479. This position of the defense is untenable, because Apolonio Andia 
did not take part in the initial assault of his brothers on policeman Lucana. 
The evidence is clear that he arrived later, after the fight had begun; was at 
first intercepted by Sergeant Afable, ran away from the latter, and after 
evading pursuit returned to stab Lucana while the latter was helpless and held 
by the appellant's brothers. Plainly, Apolonio took advantage of the 
helplessness of his victim to stab him without risk to himself. It may not have 
been deliberately planned beforehand; but treachery can exist without 
premeditation.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General correctly observed that the ordinary aggravating 
circumstance of disregard of rank (Art. 14, par. 3, Revised Penal Code) also 
attended the commission of the offense, it appearing that Jaime Lucana was in 
the performance of his duty as a police officer at the time he was assaulted and 
killed. However, this aggravation is offset by the mitigating circumstance of 
lack of instruction, since appellant never received any form of education.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed. Costs against appellant in 
this instance.</p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
