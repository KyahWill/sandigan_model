				<BR><STRONG>ANTONIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a verified complaint filed on October 15, 1968 by Acting City Fiscal Norberto L. Zulueta, of Cadiz, Negros Occidental, and Eva Mabug-at, widow of the deceased Norberto Tongoy, respondent is charged with gross malfeasance in office, gross ignorance of the law, and for knowingly rendering an unjust judgment.<br><br>The aforecited charges stemmed from the order of respondent dated September 5, 1968 and his decision acquitting accused Carlos Caramonte promulgated on September 21, 1968, in Criminal Case No. 690, entitled "People of the Philippines versus Isabelo Montemayor, et al.," for Robbery in Band with Homicide.<br><br>In the Resolution of this Court dated October 22, 1968, the complaint was given due course, and respondent was required to file an answer to the complaint within ten (10) days from notice thereof, and after the filing of respondent's answer, the case was referred on December 17, 1968 to the Hon. Nicasio Yatco, Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, for investigation and report.&nbsp; On April 11, 1968, after conducting the requisite investigation thereon, the investigator submitted his Report recommending the exoneration of respondent.<br><br>It appears from the record that Acting City Fiscal Norberto L. Zulueta, of Cadiz, Negros Occidental, filed a charge for Robbery in Band with Homicide against thirteen (13) persons as principals, seven (7) persons as accomplices, and two (2) persons as accessories, with the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, in Criminal Case No. 690.&nbsp; The case was assigned to Branch I, Silay City, presided over by the respondent.&nbsp; Out of the 13 persons charged as principals for the crime, only Carlos Caramonte was arrested and tried (the six other alleged principals, including Isabelo Montemayor, remained at large), while of the persons charged as accomplices and accessories, the case with respect to them was dismissed at the instance of the prosecution or with its conformity, in the following manner:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="85%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="7%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td> <td width="93%"><div align="justify">Before arraignment:-</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Jorge Canonoyo<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">After arraignment:-</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Agustin Cañete</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Rosendo Cañete</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Arsenio Luyao</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Elias Giducos</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Pedro Layon</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Antonio Placencia<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Accused Luciano Salinas was discharged from the information and utilized as state witness; and<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Accused Honorato de Sales, Paulino Quijano, Cristeta Jimenez, Constancio Pangahin, Julio Elmo, Primitivo Mata, and Rene Fernandez before the Amended Information of April 26, 1968, were dropped.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>After the case was submitted for decision, respondent issued an order, dated September 5, 1968, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"The parties are notified that the Court intends to take judicial notice that the Mateo Chua-Antonio Uy Compound in Cadiz City is the hub of a large fishing industry operating in the Visayas; that the said compound is only about 500 meters away from the Police Station and the City Hall in Cadiz; and that the neighborhood is well-lighted and well-populated.&nbsp; <br><br>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>Thereafter, or more particularly, on September 21, 1968, respondent promulgated his decision in the case acquitting Carlos Caramonte.<br><br>Subsequently, Acting City Fiscal Zulueta appealed the aforementioned decision to this Court; and when required to comment on said appeal, Solicitor General Antonio P. Barredo, now an Associate Justice of this Court, submitted his comment on November 28, 1968 to the effect that the prosecution cannot appeal from the judgment of acquittal in view of the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, and made the observation that "While the validity of the ocular inspection conducted by the lower court is open to doubt, the unvarnished fact remains that the judgment of acquittal was not premised solely on the results of said ocular inspection, as erroneously contended by the prosecutor.&nbsp; A cursory perusal of the decision will at once show that said acquittal was predicated on other well-considered facts and circumstances so thoroughly discussed by the lower court in its decision and the least of those was its observation arising from the ocular inspection."<br><br>On January 30, 1969, this Court, through Justice Fernando, promulgated its Resolution dismissing the appeal (G. R. No. L-29599).&nbsp; In the meantime, on October 15, 1968, the aforementioned complaint against respondent was instituted as aforestated.<br><br>In his Report, the investigator stated:<br><blockquote>"Under the first indictment, complainants bewail as gross malfeasance in office and gross ignorance of the law, the following behaviour of the respondent Judge in the case:<br><center><br>‘I. GROSS MALFEASANCE IN OFFICE<br>and<br>GROSS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW<br></center><br>'After both parties submitted their respective Memorandum attached herewith as Annexes 'C' and 'D', Criminal Case No. 690 for 'Robbery in Band with Homicide' was closed and submitted for Decision on July 1, 1968.<br><br>‘About one and a half (1-1/2) months thereafter, or at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday, 11 August 1968, respondent judge made a secret ocular inspection of the poblacion of the City of Cadiz.&nbsp; Without anybody to guide him, he visited the places which he thought erroneously were the scene of the robbery where the Chief of Police was killed by the Montemayor gang at about 11:00 o'clock of the dark night of December 31, 1967.&nbsp; It should be noted that Cadiz City is 65 kms. away from Bacolod City, the capital of the province.&nbsp; Because of that undeniably biased ocular inspection, the honorable trial judge, who is reputed to be brilliant, issued a reckless, extremely senseless and stupid order dated 5 September 1968, to wit:<br><blockquote>'The parties are notified that the Court intends to take judicial notice that the Mateo Chua-Antonio Uy Compound in Cadiz City is the hub of a large fishing industry operating in the Visayas; that the said compound is only about 500 meters away from the Police Station and the City Hall in Cadiz; and that the neighborhood is well-lighted and well-populated.<br><br>'SO ORDERED.'–</blockquote>which Order, as any student of law would tell you, is null and void, and illegal <i>per se</i>.&nbsp; Why respondent Honorable Judge went out of his way to gather those immaterial and 'fabricated' evidence in favor of the accused is shocking to the conscience.&nbsp; To say the least, it is gross ignorance of the law.&nbsp; <i>Why did respondent judge show his hand unnecessarily and prematurely?</i>&nbsp; Perhaps, a psychologist or a psychiatrist would explain that the Order of September 5th is that of an anguished mind; an Order issued by a Judge who for the first time had to violate his oath of office; by a judge who, due to political pressure and against his will and better judgment, had to acquit councilor Carlos Caramonte of the municipality of Bantayan, province of Cebu.&nbsp; Like an amateur murderer respondent judge left telltale clues all around.&nbsp; A murderer, however, may have a strong motive.&nbsp; But what of a judge who knowingly commits a ‘revolting injustice' or through gross ignorance of the law?'<br><br>"It could be gleaned from a careful perusal of the complaint that complainants bemoaned the fact that the respondent Judge conducted a ‘secret ocular inspection' of the poblacion of the City of Cadiz at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday, August 11, 1968, without anybody to guide him, much less in the presence of the prosecution and concluded that such alleged secret ocular inspection was the basis of the Order of September 5, 1968.&nbsp; A painstaking scrutiny of the records as well as the evidence presented by the parties does not show any concrete proof that respondent Judge did conduct a 'secret ocular inspection' of the poblacion of the City of Cadiz as seriously charged by the complainants.&nbsp; In fact, the lone witness presented by the complainants in this case did not even make an insinuation supporting such serious allegation of said complainants.&nbsp; The fact is, from the order of September 5, 1968, the respondent Judge took judicial notice 'that the Mateo Chua-Antonio Uy Compound in Cadiz City is the hub of a large fishing industry operating in the Visayas; that the said compound is only about 500 meters away from the Police Station and the City Hall in Cadiz; and that the neighborhood is well-lighted and well-populated.' Nowhere therefrom could it be deduced that respondent Judge took judicial notice of these facts by virtue of an ocular inspection he conducted on the date alleged by the complainants.<br><br>"In any event, there is likewise nothing in the record to support the charge of the complainants that the order of September 5, 1968, was made by the respondent Judge as the sole basis for the acquittal of Carlos Caramonte.&nbsp; In fact, the decision of the respondent Judge shows that in rendering a judgment of acquittal in the case before him, said respondent entertained serious doubts as to the guilt of Caramonte because of the failure of anyone — in the Chua and in the Uy households, the security guards, the policemen who engaged the robbers in battle — to identify Caramonte as one of the participants in the alleged crime.&nbsp; Thus, the decision pertinently reads:<br><br>‘Is Caramonte guilty?<br><blockquote>'In spite of the admission of Caramonte's Exh. C and the damaging inferences derived from his staying away from the ceremony when the newly-­elected officials of Bantayan were inducted into office, there is doubt in the mind of the Court as to his actual participation in the bold raid on Cadiz City on December 31, 1967, because of the failure of anyone — the adults and the children in the Chua and in the Uy households, the security guards, the policemen who engaged the robbers in battle — to say on the stand that Caramonte was indeed one of the robbers.<br><br>'The Uy spouses and Mateo Chua all took the stand.&nbsp; They and the other members of the household were tied up by the robbers, who then ransacked the two houses for about an hour.&nbsp; Thereafter, some of them were taken to the seashore to prevent the police from firing on the retreating robbers.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">'Mateo Chua said at the trial:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">'Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">At about 9:30 in the evening of Dec. 31, 1967, where were you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I was in my house.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you remember anything unusual that happened that evening in your house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Please tell the Court what happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Several men, pirates, came up my house and broke into my house.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">About what time did you notice those pirates forced themselves inside your residence?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Between 9:30 and 10:00 that evening.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was the first thing you noticed when the pirates as you said arrived?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I was about to sleep when they came up, three of them went straight up my house.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">How many floors has your house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Two floors.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(Decision, pp. 12-16).<br></blockquote>"Be that as it may, under Section 173 of the Revised Administrative Code, the grounds for removal of a judge of first instance are (1) serious misconduct and (2) inefficiency.&nbsp; For serious misconduct to exist, there must be reliable evidence showing that the judicial acts complained of were corrupt or inspired by an intention to violate the law, or were in persistent disregard of well-known legal rules.&nbsp; (In re Impeachment of Hon. Antonio Horilleno, 43 Phil. 212).&nbsp; In the case at bar, there has been no proof that in issuing the order of September 5, 1968 (Exh. B), and in rendering a judgment of acquittal the respondent Judge was inspired by a dishonest or corrupt intention which prompted him to violate the law or to disregard well-known legal rules.&nbsp; In fact, in spite of the biting language of the complainants in their complaint and in their memorandum, they admit that the respondent Judge is not dishonest as far as they know.&nbsp; Of course, there has been an insinuation that 'respondent Judge prostituted this Court and acquitted, obviously in bad faith, Councilor Caramonte of Bantayan, province of Cebu, in all likelihood because of the dirty hands of power politics.' Inasmuch as proceedings against judges as the case at bar, have been said to be governed by the rules of law applicable to penal cases, the charges must, therefore, be proved beyond reasonable doubt (In re Horrilleno, supra), and it is incumbent upon the complainants to prove their case not by a preponderance of evidence but beyond a reasonable doubt, and in this venture, it is believed they failed.&nbsp; There is, indeed, a paucity of proof that respondent Judge has acted partially, or maliciously, or corruptly, or arbitrarily or oppressively.<br><center><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>In issuing the order of Sept. 5, 1968, respondent Judge as stated in his answer, was guided by the Model Code of Evidence cited by Chief Justice Moran in his Comments on the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Whether in taking judicial notice of the facts stated in the order of September 5, 1968, respondent Judge erred or not, it is believed, this is not the proper forum to dwell on the matter.&nbsp; Since this is an administrative case against him, the controlling factor should be the circumstances surrounding the issuance of such order — whether in doing so the respondent Judge was arbitrary, corrupt, partial, or oppressive.&nbsp; As heretofore stated, the undersigned finds no proof beyond reasonable doubt along that line.<br><br>"Furthermore, it appears from the record that the Office of the City Fiscal received a copy of the Order of September 5, 1968 on September 13, 1968.&nbsp; If it were true as alleged by the complainants that the issuance of such order was illegal and that the matters taken judicial notice of therein were wrong, it behooves upon Fiscal Zulueta, as the prosecutor of the case, to seek for a reconsideration of such order and at the same time to invite the attention of the court to the alleged errors, if there were any.&nbsp; But as the records show, the prosecution in the said case did not take any steps — from September 13 to September 21, or a span of eight days — to protect the interests of the State against what complainants herein term to be an 'illegality'.&nbsp; Of course, the complainants herein lean on the argument that —<br><blockquote>`Fiscal Zulueta<br><br>‘Because if I do that, Your Honor, respondent Judge would realize his mistake which we believe malicious.' (p. 29, t.s.n.).<br></blockquote>It may be pertinent to state at this juncture, that this attitude of the prosecution in Criminal Case No. 690 does not appear to be commendable.&nbsp; A prosecutor should lay before the court fairly and fully every fact and circumstance known to him to exist, without regard to whether such fact tends to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused (Malcolm, Legal and Judicial Ethics, p. 123) and to this may be added without regard to any personal conviction or presumption of what the Judge may do or is disposed to do.&nbsp; Prosecuting officers are 'presumed to be men learned in the law, of a high character, and to perform their duties impartially and with but one object in view, that being that justice may be meted out to all violators of the law and that no innocent man be punished (Malcolm, p. 124).&nbsp; In the pursuit of that solemn obligation, therefore, personal conviction should be ignored lest it may lead to a sacrifice of the purpose sought to be achieved.&nbsp; Fortunately, in Criminal Case No. 690, the very witness of the complainants affirmed the correctness of the matters taken judicial notice of by the respondent Judge.&nbsp; Thus, Mr. Agustin Javier, lone witness for the complainants, testified —<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">'Atty.

Barredo in his comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> "the validity of the ocular inspection conducted by the lower court is open to doubt."<br><br>Indeed, such <i>ex-parte</i> ocular inspection conducted by respondent judge alone without notice to nor the presence of the parties and after the case had already been submitted for decision was improperly made and may not be sanctioned.&nbsp; If he had entertained doubts that he wished to clear up after the trial had already terminated, he should have ordered motu proprio the reopening of the trial for the purpose, with due notice to the parties for their participation therein is essential to due process.<br><br>As succinctly restated by Chief Justice Moran, "(T)he inspection or view outside the courtroom should be made in the presence of the parties or at least with previous notice to them in order that they may show the object to be viewed.&nbsp; Such inspection or view is a part of the trial, inasmuch as evidence is thereby being received, which is expressly authorized by law.&nbsp; The <i>parties</i> are <i>entitled to be present at any stage of the trial,</i> and consequently they are entitled to be at least notified of the time and place set for the view.&nbsp; It is an <i>error</i> for the judge to go alone to the land in question, or to the place where the crime was committed and take a view, without previous knowledge or consent of the parties, inspected the place of collision, and in his decision stated that after having viewed the place, he was convinced that the testimony of one of the witnesses was incredible."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>As was aptly held by the appellate court in setting aside such <i>ex-parte</i> ocular inspection conducted by a trial judge "(W)e know of no rule of law or practice which authorizes a trial judge, after a cause had been submitted to him for determination, to search of his own motion and without the consent of the parties for extrinsic testimony and circumstances, and apply what he may learn in his way to corroborate the testimony upon one side or to cast discredit on the testimony of the adverse party."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> At page 6, main opinion.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> At pages 7-10, main opinion.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> At page 3, main opinion.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 5 Moran's Rules of Court, 1970 Ed., p. 81, italics supplied.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><i> Idem.,</i> at p. 82, quoting from <span style="font-style: italic;">Denver Omnibus &amp; Cab Co. vs. Ward Auction Co., </span>47 Colo. 446, cited in Balon vs. Moreno, 57 Phil. 60, 69.<br></div>
