				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Eizal, the 
dispositive part of which reads:
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment ordering the 
defendant, Francisco Sycip, to vacate the leased premises, to pay plaintiif 
Domingo E. Leonor the batfk rentals from July 13, 1956 at the rate of three 
hundred fifty pesos P350.00 a month until he shall have vacated the leased 
premises and to pay the costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The case is before us, the pertinent facts having been agreed upon and only 
questions of law being raised in the appeal.</p>
<p>On July 11, 1955, plaintiff Domingo E. Leonor and defendant Francisco Sycip 
entered into a contract, whereby the former leased to the latter a two-story 
buildjng located at No. 1728-D Taft Avenue, interior, Pasay City, for a period 
of two years, beginning, from August 1, 195S, at a monthly rental of P350.00. 
From July to October, 1956, Sycip failed to pay the corresponding rentals in 
view of which, on October 12, 1956, Leonor instituted against him, in the 
municipal court of Pasay City, Civil Case No. 1972 thereof, for unlawful 
detainer. Inasmuch as, on October 19, 1956, one Napoleon A. Coronado agreed to 
guarantee the payment of the rentals due from Sycip by assigning to Leonor his 
(Coronado's) rights under a deed of chattel mortgage executed, prior thereto, by 
Sycip in his (Coronado's) favor, on November 10, 1956, Leonor moved for the 
dismissal of said case No. 1972, which was granted on November 12, 1956.</p>
<p>As Sycip kept on defaulting in the payment of rentals, Leonor requested the 
Sheriff of Pasay City, on February 11, 1957, to cause the personal property 
subject to said chattel mortgage to be foreclosed extra judicially, as 
stipulated in the contract, but this provision thereof could not be enforced 
because Sycip refused to surrender said property to the sheriff. Hence, on March 
7, 1957, Leonor again sued Sycip in the municipal court of Pasay City for 
unlawful detainer (Civil Case No. 2067), to eject him from the leased premises 
and collect the rental from July, 1956 to March, 1957. On the date set for the. 
hearing of the case, Leonor introduced his evidence, after which Sycip waived Ms 
right to introduce evidence and submitted the case for decision, which was 
rendered on May 24, 1957. It sentenced Sycip to vacate said premises and to pay 
Leonor P3,800 as rentals due up to said date, with interest thereon at the legal 
rate from the institution of the case, as well as the rentals that may fall due 
thereafter, at the rate of f 350 a month, until the premises shall have been 
vacated, in addition to P150 as attorney's fees, and the costs of the 
proceedings.</p>
<p>On May 27, 1957, Sycip filed notice of appeal from this decision. Pending 
perfection of the appeal, or on May 28, 1957, plaintiff moved for the immediate 
execution of said decision, which was granted on June 1, 1957. Pursuant to the 
writ of execution accordingly issued, the Sheriff of Pasay City sold at public 
auction, on July 8, 1957, certain properties of Sycip for the sum of P3,500. 
Deducting this sum from the amount then due from Sycip under the appealed 
decision, or P4,495.60, plus the ex- penses of execution, amounting P327.00, 
there remained a balance of P1,322.60 still due from him. Moreover, Sycip's 
ejectment took place on July 13, 1957. When the appealed case was heard in the 
Court of First Instance of Rizal (Civil Case No. 1756-B), Sycip maintained that 
it should be dismissed upon the ground:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I. That the claim set forth in the complaint has been released;<br><br>"II. 
That the Assignment of Chattel Mortgage which dismissed the first action (Civil 
Case No. 1792, is a compromise agreement that had upon the parties the effect 
and authority of <i>Res-Judicata</i>;<br><br>"III. That the second action, the 
case at bar, (Civil Case No. 2067) cannot be taken to mean as a rescission of 
the compromise agreement."</p></blockquote>
<p>Said court, however, overruled defendant's pretense and rendered the decision 
appealed from. A reconsideration thereof having been denied, the case has been 
brought to us on appeal taken by Sycip.</p>
<p>Appellant says that the lower court erred in holding that the claim set forth 
in the complaint herein has not been "released by novation", which he maintains, 
took place, because the deed of assignment by Coronado to Leonor of the chattel 
mortgage executed by Sycip in favor of Coronado stated that the sum of P2,450 
then due from Sycip was payable on December 31, 1956, whereas the contract of 
lease between Leonor and Sycip stipulated that the agreed rentals were "payable 
on or before the 5th of every month". Said assignment was made, however, on 
October 6, 1956, and, hence, the period therein given for the payment of the 
aforementioned sum of P2,450.00, due <i>up to that date</i>, did not novate or 
otherwise affect the obligation to pay the rentals accruing <i>subsequently</i> 
thereto, in conformity with the provisions of the aforementioned contract of 
lease, or "on or before the 5th of every month", although payment of these 
rentals was also guaranteed by the chattel mortgage thus assigned to Leonor. 
Inasmuch as Sycip continued defaulting in the payment of such rentals, and 
failed to pay the same as well as to vacate the leased premises, despite 
repeated demands, it follows that Leonor was entitled to seek the proper remedy 
against the resulting unlawful detainer by Sycip.</p>
<p>Obviously, the security given to guarantee the payment of rentals falling due 
<i>after</i> October 6, 1956, did not extinguish or novate the obligation to 
satisfy the same, or impair the right of the lessor to the aforementioned remedy 
(Bank of the P.I. <i>vs</i>. Herridge, 47, Phil., 57; Asia Banking Corporation 
<i>vs</i>. Lacson, 48 Phil., 482; 8 Manresa 429). There is no incompatibility 
between, either this remedy or said obligation, on the one hand, and the 
aforementioned security, on the other. On the contrary, the chattel mortgage 
bolstered up said remedy and strengthened the effectivity of the obligation, by 
insuring the collection of the money judgment that may be rendered in the action 
for unlawful detainer.</p>
<p>It is next urged by the defendant that plaintiff should have sought a 
judicial foreclosure of the chattel mortgage or sued the guarantor Napoleon A. 
Coronado. This contention is premised upon the assumption that by plaintiff's 
acceptance of the assignment of chattel mortgage, there had been a novation of 
the lease contract between him and Sycip, for the period subsequent to October 
6, 1956, which is not a fact. Plaintiff had, of course, the option to seek 
judicial foreclosure of said chattel mortgage, but he was not bound to do so, 
for the assignment in his favor of the chattel mortgage merely gave him 
<i>additional</i> rights. It did not deprive him of any of his existing rights, 
either substantive or procedural, except insofar as the sum of P2,450 due as 
rentals up to October 6, 1956, which was made payable on or before December 31, 
1956. With respect to the rentals accruing <i>after</i> October 6, 1956, he 
retained all such rights, <i>plus</i> the corresponding lien on the personal 
property subject to the chattel mortgage.</p>
<p>Contrary to defendant's pretense, plaintiff could not have sued Coronado for, 
by virtue of his aforementioned assignment, the latter merely yielded his 
preferred <i>lien</i> in favor of plaintiff herein, and did" not assume any 
responsibility for <i>defendant's obligation</i> in favor of plaintiff herein. 
Besides, having violated the chattel mortgage contract, by refusing to deliver 
the mortgaged property to the sheriff, for purposes of the extrajudicial 
foreclosure, to which the defendant had explicitly agreed in the deed of chattel 
mortgage, he may not require the plaintiff to adhere thereto (Art. 1191, Civil 
Code of the Phil). Again, owing to the breach of the compromise agreement 
between the parties, resulting, not only from defendant's refusal to deliver the 
mortgaged property to the sheriff, but, also from his failure to pay, on or 
before December 31, 1956, the sum of P2.450, due on October 6, 1956, plaintiff 
has, under Article 2041 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, the right either 
to "enforce the compromise or regard it as rescinded and insist upon his 
original demand".</p>
<p>It is worthy of notice, in this connection, that, unlike Article 2089 of the 
same Code, which speaks of "a <i>cause</i> of annulment or rescission of the 
compromise" and provides that "the compromise <i>may be annulled or 
rescinded</i>" for the cause therein specified, thus suggesting an action for 
annulment or rescission, said Article 2041 confers upon the party concerned, not 
a "cause" for rescission, or the right to "demand" the rescission of a 
compromise, but the authority, not only to "regard it as rescinded", but, also, 
to "insist upon his original demand". The language of this Article 2041, 
particularly when contrasted with that of Article 2039, denotes that no action 
for rescission is required in said Article 2041, and that the party aggrieved by 
the breach of a compromise agreement may, if he chooses, bring the suit 
contemplated or involved in his original demand, as if there had never been any 
compromise agreement, without bringing an action for rescission thereof. He need 
not seek a judicial declaration of rescission, for he may "regard" the 
compromise agreement already "rescinded".</p>
<p>Any other view would lead, insofar as the parties herein are concerned, to a 
splitting of plaintiff's cause of action. Indeed, to seek a rescission of the 
compromise, an action would have to be brought in the court of first instance, 
for such action is incapable of pecuniary estimation, whereas the unlawful 
detainer case would have to be filed with the municipal court. Moreover, if the 
right of action for unlawful detainer would be subordinated te the action for 
rescission of the compromise agreement, then the latter would be a prejudicial 
question and the proceedings in the former would have to be suspended until the 
final disposition of the action for rescission. The summary nature of the remedy 
of unlawful detainer would thus be completely defeated or destroyed. Surely, the 
framers of Article 2041 of the Civil Code of the Philippines could not have 
intended such result. The case of Bas Vda. de Concepcion <i>vs</i>. Santos, 89 
Phil., 429, cited in appellant's brief, involved a compromise made on January 
24, 1943, years before the approval of said Code, and, hence, it is not in 
point.</p>
<p>In the light of the foregoing, defendant's theory to the effect that 
plaintiff's complaint in the present case contains no allegations to warrant 
rescission of their compromise agreement is pointless, an action for rescission 
being unnecessary.</p>
<p>Defendant brands the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal as 
vague and erroneous because it sentences him to pay the plaintiff back rentals, 
at the rate of P350.00 a month, from July 13, 1956 until such time as he 
(defendant) shall have vacated the leased premises, whereas the record on appeal 
shows that he had been ejected from said premises on July 13, 1957, or prior to 
the rendition of said decision on March 29, 1958. This fact does not detract, 
however, from the precision and accuracy of said decision, for, pursuant 
thereto, he shall pay rentals, at the aforementioned rate, from July 13, 1956 to 
July 13, 1957.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
defendant-appellant, Francisco Sycip. It is so ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J.,
