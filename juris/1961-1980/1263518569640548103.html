				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Defendant, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Peoples Bank
&amp; Trust Company, is sought to be held liable in the amount of P14, 608.05,
the sum payable in a check issued by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company drawn on plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> &amp; Shanghai
Banking Corpo­ration, now appellant, with itself as payee, the check thereafter
falling into the hands of a third party who substituted his name there­on and
was able to collect such amount from defendant Bank where it was
deposited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff was unsuccessful,
the Court of First Instance of Manila, the Honorable Jesus de <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span> presiding, dis­missing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It considered as decisive the fact that
plaintiff Bank allowed 27 days to elapse after clearing before notifying
defendant Bank as to such alteration, the applicable Central Bank regulation providing
for a 24-hour period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
this appeal.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relying as the lower
court did on a controlling <span class="GramE">decision,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
its decision cannot be reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts, as noted in the appealed decision,
follow:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1965</st1:date>, the Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Company drew the check * * * on <span style="">the
</span><span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation
and in favor of the same bank in the sum of P14, 608.05.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This check <span style="">was </span>sent by mail to the Payee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Somehow <span style="">or </span>other, the
check fell in the hands of a certain <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Changco</span>, who was able to erase the name of the payee Bank
and instead typed his own name on the check.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Four days before, <span class="SpellE">Changco</span> had opened <span style="">a current account </span>with Defendant
Peoples Bank and Trust Company and on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1965</st1:date>, he deposited the altered check in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This check was presented by the Peoples Bank
for clearing wherein the Peoples Bank made the following <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'For clearance, clearing office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All prior endorsements and/or lack of endorse­ments
guaranteed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Peoples
Bank and Trust Company'.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
check was duly cleared by the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> Shanghai Bank,
so that the Peoples Bank credited <span class="SpellE">Changco</span> with the
amount of the check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beginning <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Changco</span>
began to withdraw from his account and on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>he closed his account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the cancelled check went the
route of the regular routine and on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="4">April
 12, 1965</st1:date> it was returned to the Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company when the alteration in the name of the payee was discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that same date, Peoples Bank was notified
of the alteration, so that the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> Shanghai Bank
requested Peoples Bank to refund to it the sum of P14, 608.05 which had been
previously credited by Plaintiff Bank in favor of Defendant Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon its refusal to do so, this case has been
filed."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why the complaint had to be dismissed was made clear in such
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The entire case of Plaintiff is based
on the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> that has been heretofore copied –
namely, a guarantee of all prior <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> made by
Peoples Bank and since such an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> carries
with it a concomitant guarantee of genuineness, the Peoples Bank is liable to
the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> Shanghai Bank for alteration made in the
name of payee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
Peoples Bank relies on the '24-hour' regulation of the Central Bank that
requires after a clearing, that all cleared items must be returned not later
than <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 PM</st1:time> of the following
business day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> Shanghai Bank only advised the Peoples Bank as to
the alteration on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1965</st1:date>
or 27 days after clearing, the Peoples Bank claims that it is now too late to
do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This regulation <span style="">of </span>the Central Bank as to 24 hours is
challenged by Plaintiff Bank as being merely part of an ingenious device to
facilitate banking transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that
what it may – as both Plaintiff as well as Defendant Banks <span class="GramE">are</span>
part of our bank­ing system and both are subject to regulations of the Central
Bank – they are both bound by such regulations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, our Supreme Court has already held that the 24-hour regulation
of the Central Bank in clearing house operations is valid and if banks feel the
24-hour period is unwise, they should make proper representations with the
Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But until they do so, they
are bound by such a 24-hour period (Republic v. Equitable Banking Corporation,
GR No. L-15894; <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1964</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Plaintiff Bank insists that Defendant
Bank is liable on its <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> during clearing
house operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">indorse­ment</span>, itself, is very clear when it begins with the
words '<span class="GramE">For</span> clearance, clearing office * * *’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, such an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
must be read together with the 24-hour regulation on clearing House Operations
of the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once that 24-hour
period is over, the liability on such an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
has ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, Plaintiff Bank
has not made out a case for relief."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was therefore dismissed, resulting in this appeal
to us on a question of law, which, as set forth in the principal assigned error
is predicated on the inapplicability of the 24-hour clearing house rule of the
Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff does not deny
that in Republic v. Equitable Banking Corporation,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Honorable Court, through the then Justice, now Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, applied the "24-hour" clearing house
rule issued by the Central Bank in accordance with its rule-making
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted in the aforesaid
decision, its adoption came after a conference with representatives and
officials of different banking institutions in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is embodied in section 4, subsection(c) of
Circular No. <span style="">9 </span>of the Central
Bank dated February 17, 1949, as amended by the then Governor of the Central
Bank on June 4, 1949, and reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"'Items which should be returned for any reason whatsoever shall be
returned directly to the bank, institution or entity from which the item was
received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, the Receipt
for Returned Checks (Cash Form No. 9) should be used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original and duplicate copies of said
Receipt shall be given to the bank, institution or entity which returned the
items and the triplicate copy should be retained by the bank, institution or
entity whose demand is being returned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the following clearing, the original of the Receipt for Returned
Checks shall be pre­sented through the Clearing Office as a demand against the
bank, institution or entity whose item has been returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in this section shall prevent the
returned items from being settled by direct reimbursement to the bank,
institution or entity returning the items.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>All items cleared at 11:00 o'clock a.m. shall be returned not later
than 2:00 o'clock p.m. on the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>same day
and all items cleared at 3:00 o'clock p.m. shall be returned not later than
8:30 a. m. of the following business day, except for items cleared on Saturday which
may be returned not later than 8:30 of the following day</u>.' (Italics
supplied)"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It is apparent from the above that the attempted distinction sought to be made
by plaintiff to the effect that it refers to forged, but not to altered checks
is not warranted. The circular is clear and comprehensive; the facts of the
present case fall within it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court acted correctly in relying on the doctrine announced in the above
Republic v. Equitable Banking Corporation decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">An excerpt from the opinion of the Chief Justice is likewise
relevant as indicative of the correctness of the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"At any rate, the aforementioned twenty-eight (28) warrants were
cleared and paid by the Treasurer, in view of which the PI Bank and the
Equitable Bank credited the correspond­ing amounts to the respective depositors
of the warrants and then honored their checks for said amounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Treasury had not only been
negligent in clearing its own warrants, but had, also, thereby induced the PI Bank
and the Equitable Bank to pay the amounts thereof to <span class="GramE">said</span>
depositors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gross nature of the
negligence of the Treasury becomes more apparent when we consider that each one
of the twenty-four (24) warrants involved in G.R. No. L-15895 was for over P5,
000, and, hence; <u>beyond</u> the authority of the auditor of the Treasury –
whose signature thereon had been forged – to approve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the irregularity of said
warrants was apparent on the face thereof, from the viewpoint of the Treasury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the same had not advertised the
loss of genuine forms of its warrants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither had the PI Bank nor the Equitable Bank been informed of any
irregularity in connection with any of the warrants involved in these two (2)
cases, until after December 23, 1952, – or after the warrants had been cleared
and honored – when the Treasury gave notice of the forgeries adverted to
above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the loss of the
amounts thereof is mainly imputable to acts and omissions of the Treasury, for
which the PI Bank and the Equitable Bank should not and cannot be
penalized."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in one of the very cases relied upon by plaintiff, as
appellant mention is made of a principle on which defendant Bank could have
acted without incurring the liability now sought to be imposed by
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is a settled rule that a person who
presents for payment checks such as are here involved guarantees the
genuineness of the check, and the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank need
concern itself with nothing but the genuineness of the signature, and the state
of the account with it of the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
If at all, then, whatever remedy the plaintiff has would lie not against
defendant Bank but as against the party responsible for changing the name of
the payee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its failure to call the
attention of defendant Bank as to such alteration until after the lapse of 27
days would, in the light of the above Central Bank circular, negate whatever
right it might have had against defendant Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While not exactly in point, a later decision of the Chief Justice announced
in 1968, involving a forged check, argues for the correctness of the conclusion
reached by the lower court even assuming that a fault could be imputed to
defendant Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Then, again, it has, likewise, been
held that, where the collecting (PCIB) and the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span>
(PNB) banks are equally at fault, the court will leave the parties where it
finds them."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>
