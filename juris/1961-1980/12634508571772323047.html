				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> in civil case No. 925, dis­missing plaintiff's
complaint so far as concerns the collection of deficiency income taxes for the
years 1951, 1953 and 1954 and additional residence taxes for 1951 and 1952, and
requiring the defendant to file his answer with respect to deficiency income
tax for 1955 and residence taxes for 1953-1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the complaint filed by the Republic of the Philippines,
through the Solicitor General, against Pedro B. <span class="SpellE">Patanao</span>,
it is alleged that defendant was the holder of an ordinary timber license with
concession at Esperanza, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, and as such was
engaged in the business of producing logs and lumber for sale during the years
1951-1955; that defendant failed to file in­come tax returns for 1953 and 1954,
and although he filed income tax returns for 1951, 1952 and 1955, the same were
false and fraudulent because he did not report substantial income earned by him
from his business; that in an examination conducted by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue on defendant's income and expenses for 1951-1955, it was ascertained
that the sum of P79,892.75, represent­ing deficiency income taxes and
additional residence taxes for the aforesaid years, is due from defendant; that
on February 14, 1958, plaintiff, through the Deputy Commis­sioner of Internal
Revenue, sent a letter of demand with enclosed income tax assessment to the
defendant requiring him to pay the said amount; that notwithstanding repeated
demands the defendant refused, failed and neglected to pay said taxes; and that
the assessment for the payment of the taxes in question has become final, <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and demandable, because it was not contested
before the Court of Tax Appeals in accordance with the provisions of section 11
of Republic Act No. 1125.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on two grounds,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the action is barred by
prior judgment, defendant having been acquitted in criminal cases Nos. 2089 and
2090 of the same court, which were prosecutions for failure to file income tax
returns and for <span class="GramE">nonpayment</span> of income taxes; and (2)
that the action has prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the motion to dismiss, the oppo­sition thereto
and the rejoinder to the opposition, the lower court entered the order appealed
from, holding that the only cause of action left to the plaintiff in its com­plaint
is the collection of the income tax due for the taxable year 1955 and the
residence tax (Class B) for 1953, 1954 and 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to reconsider said order was denied,
whereupon plaintiff interposed the instant appeal, which was brought directly
to this Court, the questions involved being purely legal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion of the trial court, that the present action is
barred by prior judgment, is anchored on the following rationale:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that the de­fendant herein has been accused
in Cri­minal Cases Nos. 2089 and 2090 of this Court for not filing his income
tax re­turns and for non-payment of income taxes for the years 1953 and
1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases, he was
acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule in this jurisdiction
is that the accused once acquitted is exempt from both criminal and civil
responsibility because when a criminal action is instituted, civil action
arising from the same offense is impliedly instituted un­less the offended
party expressly waives the civil action or reserves the right to file it
separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the criminal cases
abovementioned wherein the defendant was completely exonerated, there was no
waiver or reservation to file a separate civil case so that the failure to
obtain conviction on a charge of non-payment of income taxes is fatal to any
civil action to collect the payment of said taxes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Plaintiff-appellant assails the ruling as
erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
on his part urges that it should be maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In applying the principle underlying the civil liability of an
offender under the Penal Code to a case involving the collection of taxes, the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> fell into error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two cases are circumscribed by factual premises which are
diametrically opposed to each other, and are founded on entirely different phi­losophies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Penal Code the civil liability is
incurred by reason of the offender's criminal act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, the criminal liability
gives birth to the civil obligation such that generally, if one is not
criminally liable under the Penal Code, he cannot become civilly liable <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
situation under the income tax law is the exact opposite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil lia­bility to pay taxes arises from the
fact, for instance, that one has engaged himself in business, and not be­cause
of any criminal act committed by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cri­minal liability arises upon failure of the debtor to satisfy his
civil obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incongruity of the
factual premises and foundation principles of the two cases is one of the
reasons for not imposing civil in­demnity on the criminal <span class="SpellE">infractor</span>
of the income tax law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another reason,
of course, is found in the fact that while section 73 of the National Internal
Revenue Code has provided the imposition of the penalty of imprison­ment or
fine, or both, for refusal or neglect to pay income tax or to make a return
thereof, it failed to provide the collection of said tax in criminal proceed­ings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only civil remedies provided for the
collect­ion of income tax, in Chapters I and II, Title IX of the Code and
section 316 thereof, are <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> of goods,
chattels, etc. or by judicial action, which remedies are generally exclusive in
the absence of a contrary intent from the legislator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Arnault</span>, G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-4288, </span><st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="11"><span class="GramE">November 20, 1952</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; People vs. Tierra, G. R. Nos.</span> L-17177-17180, December 28,
1964) Considering that the Government cannot seek satisfaction of the
taxpayer's civil liability in a criminal proceeding under the tax law or,
otherwise stated, since the said civil liability is not deemed included in the
criminal action, acquittal of the taxpayer in the criminal proceeding does not
necessa­rily entail exoneration from his liability to pay the taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is error to hold, as the lower court has
held, that the judgment in the criminal cases Nos. 2089 and 2090 bars the
action in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
acquittal in the said criminal cases cannot ope­rate to discharge defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from the duty of paying the taxes which the law
requires to be paid, since that duty is imposed by statute prior to and
independently of any attempts by the taxpayer to evade payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said obligation is not a consequence of the
felonious acts charged in the criminal proceeding, nor is it a mere civil
liability arising from crime that could be wiped out by the judicial
declaration of non­existence of the criminal acts charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Castro vs. <span class="GramE">The</span>
Collector of Internal Revenue, G. R. No. L-12174, <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1962</st1:date>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding prescription of action, the lower court held that the
cause of action on the deficiency income tax and residence tax for 1951 is barred
because <span class="SpellE">appel­lee's</span> income tax return for 1951 was
assessed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue only on February 14, 1958, or beyond
the five-year period of limitation for assess­ment as provided in section 331
of the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant contends that the applicable law is section 332(a) of the same
Code under which a proceeding in court for the collection of the tax may be
commenced without assessment at any time within 10 years from the discovery of
the falsity, fraud or omission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1962</st1:date>, alleges that the fraud in the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">appellee's</span></span> is income tax return for 1951, was
discovered on <st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By filing a motion to dismiss, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> hypothetically admitted this allegation as all the
other averments in the com­plaint were so admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, section 332(a) and not section 331 of
the National Internal Revenue Code should determine whether or not the cause of
action of defi­ciency income tax and residence tax for 1951 has pres­cribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the provisions of section 332(a),
the appellant's action instituted in court on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">Decem­ber 7, 1962</st1:date> has not prescribed.</p>
