				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Jose Chua <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>, a Chinese citizen,
applied for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
hearing, the court granted the petition on the basis of its findings that the
petitioner pos­sesses all the qualifications and none of the disqua­lifications
for Philippine citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor-General has appealed, maintaining:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the petitioner is not exempt from
filing a declaration of intention; (2) that the subscribing witnesses to the
petition are not qualified to become insurers of petitioner's good conduct; and
(3) that the petitioner failed to state all his places of re­sidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is well taken.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The only evidence presented by
petitioner in support of his allegation that he was born in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are his bare testimony and his "native born certificate of residence"
which bears the date <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not bring along his parents, who are
still living, to testify, nor did he present any bap­tismal certificate which
could show his place and date of birth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His native born certificate of residence can­not on its face be
acceptable as evidence of his birth because the officer who wrote the date
therein contained as merely received them and has no personal knowledge of
them.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
With this failure on his part to establish that he was born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the petitioner should have been required to file a declaration of intention to
become a citizen.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">As to the character witnesses for
petitioner, it appears that both are employees of the New Republic Bakery where
petitioner works as sales manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first witness, Pedro Son, is a time keeper therein, while the other, <span class="SpellE">Epitacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> is the
bookkeeper of the same bakery.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It can be gathered from
the testimony of Pedro Son that although he came to know the petitioner since
birth, they did not see each other during the war and they only met each other
for the first time after the war in 1947, when this witness saw the petitioner
in <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City; that except for occasional business
dealings, they had no other occasion to meet until petitioner came to <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> in 1959; that the encounters they had had were only
in connection with the payrolls of the New Republic Bakery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Epitacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> testified that he be­came acquainted with the
petitioner only in 1953, so that he knew him (petitioner) only for ten
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The associations between
petitioner and Pedro Son, which was not continuous and between said petitioner
and <span class="SpellE">Epitacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>, which
was only for ten years, do not qualify these witnesses to testify as to the
applicant’s character and de­meanor during his entire period of his residence
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner claims to have been born in
this country, his attesting witnesses should be per­sons who have known him
continuously from childhood, because our law requires that one who desires to
be a Filipino citizen must establish that he has observed a proper and
irreproachable conduct during the entire period of his residence in the
Philippines.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the
record reveals that peti­tioner really failed to state in his petition all his
places of residence, present and former.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He only alleged that his present place of residence is <st1:street><st1:address>Real
  St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and that his former residence
was <st1:street><st1:address>39 Salazar St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony, however, he declared that
he was born in Valencia, <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City in 1929; that
during the war, he evacuated to <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> where he stayed
until 1945; that in 1945 he went back to <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City
and stayed there until 1947 when transferred to Wilson St. <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>
City; and that after six months, he again trans­ferred to Salazar St., and then
back to <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of the Naturalization Law requires that a petition for
naturalization state all of petitioner's present and former places of
residence, which includes all places where petitioner actually and physically
re­sided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this is that
information regard­ing petitioner and objection to his application are apt to
be provided by people who lived in his actual physi­cal surroundings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's omission to state all his former
places of residence is fatal to his application.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from is
hereby reversed, and consequently, the peti­tioner's application is
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
