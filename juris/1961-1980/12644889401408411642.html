				<BR><BR><div align=""><o:smarttagtype name="date" namespaceuri="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"></o:smarttagtype><div class="Section1"><br>This is an appeal from the order of Commissioner Manuel A. Concordia of the 
Social Security Commission, of April 6, 1962, dismissing the petition filed 
therein by, <span class="SpellE">Igmidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Canovas</span> 
(Case No. 189) only with regard to therein respondent Social Security System, in 
view of the absence of allegation in the petition that petitioner was unemployed 
or was a voluntary member of said System.
<p>It is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> in this proceeding that 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Canovas</span>, an employee of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Company, presumably in the course of 
his employment, was injured and hospitalized from <st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1961">January 21, 1961</st1:date> to <st1:date month="6" day="19" year="1961">June 19, 1961</st1:date>.</p>
<p>On February 5, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Canovas</span> filed a petition in 
the Social Security Commission, praying that therein named respondent <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Company and the Social Security 
System be ordered to pay him the sickness benefits allowed by Section 14 of 
Republic Act 1161, corresponding to the period of his confinement and treatment 
at the Manila Sanitarium and Hospital, or from January 21, 1961 to June 19, 
1961. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Company 
opposed the petition on the ground that it had already paid for his 
hospitalization and medical expenses and given petitioner the corresponding 
compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Law. Respondent Social Security 
System, on the other hand, filed a motion to dismiss the petition with respect 
to said entity, for lack of cause of action, the same not containing any 
allegation that petitioner has been separated from employment or that he is a 
voluntary member (of the System) at the time of the accident and 
hospitalization. Acting on this motion by the respondent System, the 
Commissioner issued the order subject of the present appeal.</p>
<p>Appellant's claim for sickness benefits against both respondents is 
predicated on Section 14 of Republic Act 1161, as amended by Republic Act 2658, 
which reads:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SEC 14.</span> <u>Sickness Benefit</u>.—(a) Under such 
rules and conditions as the Commission may prescribe, any covered employee under 
this Act who has paid at least twelve monthly contributions and who, on account 
of sickness or bodily injury is confined in a hospital, or elsewhere with the 
Commission's approval, shall, for each day of such confinement, be paid by his 
employer, <u>or by the System if such person is unemployed or is a voluntary 
member</u>, an allowance equivalent to x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; <u>Provided further</u>; That payment of such allowance 
shall be promptly made by the employer every regular Pay day, or on the 
fifteenth and last day of each month in the case of direct payment by the 
System, for as long as such allowances are due and payable.” (Underscoring 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The foregoing legal provision is clear. The sickness benefit granted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> shall be paid, in proper cases, by the employer 
<u>or</u> by the Social Security System if the claimant is unemployed or is a 
voluntary member. In other words, the System becomes liable under this section 
only in cases where the hospitalized member is without employment or his 
membership to the System is merely voluntary.</p>
<p>It is not here pretended that appellant is out of employment. On the 
contrary, it was alleged in the petition itself, and admitted by respondent 
Company in its answer, that appellant is an employee of the latter. It is 
claimed in this instance, however, that with the amendment of the law by 
Republic Act 1792, whereby the provisions on unemployment coverage and voluntary 
membership were eliminated and deleted, membership in the System is now 
exclusively compulsory. And, in view of this changed situation, the retention of 
the word "unemployed" in Section 14 of the law should cover any instance when 
the employee is not actually working, as during the period of illness.</p>
<p>This contention cannot be sustained. Firstly, tracing the history of the 
statute, the term <u>unemployed</u> has a particular meaning. Under the original 
law (Rep. Act 1161), the State aimed to establish a system to provide, among 
others, protection against "the hazards of unemployment".<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> A provision on unemployment benefit was also 
included in the law.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> With the enactment 
of Republic Act 1792, however, the protection against unemployment was withdrawn 
from the coverage of the System. So were Sections 9(b) and 10(b) on voluntary 
membership. Nevertheless, Section 14 on sickness benefits remained unaltered and 
the terms "unemployed" and "voluntary member" still appear. The retention of 
this provision could mean only that there is no alteration or change in the 
responsibility of the System with respect to this benefit, i.e., since 
membership in the System is now made compulsory and under the same law sickness 
benefit could be demanded from other parties, only those who are without or are 
separated from employment or who are voluntary members may be given this 
allowance by the System.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is not correct to say that under the present law, there are no 
more instances of unemployed or voluntary members. Section 11 of the Social 
Security Act provides:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SEC. 11.</span> <u>Effect of separation from 
employment</u>.—-When an employee under compulsory coverage is separated from 
employment, his employer's contribution on his account shall cease at the end of 
the month of separation, but said employee may continue his membership in the 
System and receive the benefits of this Act, in accordance with such roles and 
regulations as may be promulgated by the Commission."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="SpellE">Thereunder</span>, upon the separation from employment of 
a compulsory member, the latter is allowed to continue his membership in the 
System, if he so desire, although there will no longer be any contribution from 
the employer. In such event, the System will have not only an "unemployed" 
member, but the tatter's membership therein will already become voluntary.</p>
<p>It may also be added that, as pointed out by the Solicitor General, the law 
allows aggrieved parties to appeal from the decision of "the Commission"<span class="GramE">.<span class="style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style1"><sup>3]</sup></span> And, the Social Security Commission is 
composed of the Secretary of Labor and six members appointed by the 
President.<span class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> Under the law, therefore, 
appeal could be taken from the decision of the Commission <u>en banc</u>. The 
present appeal, instituted from the ruling of a single Commissioner, is 
consequently, premature.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal herein interposed is hereby dismissed, without 
costs. </p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>SO ORDERED.</b></span></p>
