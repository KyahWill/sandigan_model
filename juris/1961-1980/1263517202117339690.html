Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dismissing <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span>
Chua's petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> directed against <span class="SpellE">Barto­lome</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> and his
wife Flora <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Chua, when still in the prime of
youth, supported herself by working in nightclubs as a hostess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And sexual liaison she had with man after man
without benefit of marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She first
lived with a certain Chua Ben in 1950 by whom she had a child who died in
infancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She afterwards cohabited with <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> Lay by whom she had two
children named Robert and Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter child was born on <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after the birth of Betty, <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Chua and <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> Lay separated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Find­ing no one to fall back on after their separation, <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Chua lingered in and around nightclubs and gambling
joints, until she met Victor Tan <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time she became the latter's
mistress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1960 another child, a girl,
was born to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1961 when this last
child was still an, infant, she and <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
separated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With­out means to support the
said child, <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Chua gave her away to a <span class="SpellE"><u>comadre</u></span> in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in May 1958 <span class="SpellE">Bartolorne</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> and his wife, a childless couple, acquired the custody
of the child Betty who was then barely four months old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have since brought her up as their
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had her christened as Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> on <st1:date year="1958" day="12" month="9">September

<p class="BODY">There is some testimonial conflict on how the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>
spouses acquired custody of the girl Betty (or Grace).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Chua avers
that in October 1958, while she and <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> were
still living together, the latter surreptitiously took the child away and gave
her to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>, allegedly in recompense for
favors re­ceived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She supposedly came to
know of the whereabouts of her daughter only in 1960 when the girl, who was
then about three years old, was brought to her by <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>,
who shortly thereafter re­turned the child to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>
allegedly thru threats, intimi­dation, fraud and deceit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>
spouses assert in rebuttal that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> found
the child, wrapped in a bundle, at the gate of their residence; that she reared
her as her own and grew very fond of her; and that nobody ever molested them
until the child was 5-1/2 years of age.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, it is the lower court's finding that the child was
given to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> spouses by <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> with the know­ledge and consent of <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Chua.</p>

<p class="BODY">By letter dated <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="6">June 6,
 1963</st1:date> addressed to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> spouses,
with copy furnished to <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span>
Chua thru counsel demanded the surrender to her of the custody of the
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fail­ing to secure such custody, <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Chua (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner)
filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1963</st1:date> a
petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, praying that the court grant her custody of and
recognize her parental authority over the girl.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Named respondents in the petition were <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>
and the spouses <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1963</st1:date>
a writ was issued commanding the provin­cial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
or any of his deputies to produce the body of Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1963</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, for reasons not stated in the re­cord, the child was not
produced before the lower court as ordered.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1963</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> filed his answer to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>
filed their answer the next day.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial the lower court on <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1964</st1:date> promulgated its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court has come to the
conclusion that it will be for the welfare of the child Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> also known as Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>
to be under the custody of res­pondents Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petition dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal now before us, the petitioner tenders for re­solution
two issues of law which, by her own formulation, read as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The lower court erred when it [1]
awarded the custody of petitioner's daughter Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>, who is less than seven (7) years
old, in favor of respondents Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>, and [2] illegally deprived petitioner of pa­rental
authority over her daughter."</p>

<p class="BODY">We resolve both issues against the petitioner.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stated succinctly, the petitioner's thesis is that pursuant to
the mandate contained in article 363 of the Civil Code she can­not be separated
from her child who was less than seven years of age, and that she cannot be
deprived of her parental authority over the child because not one of the
grounds for the termination, loss, suspension or deprivation of parental
authority provided in article 332 of the same Code obtains in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether the petitioner can be legally separated from her child,
Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>,
is an issue that is now moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having been born on <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="12">December
 15, 1957</st1:date>, the child is now 11 years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the second paragraph of art.
363 of the Civil Code, which prohibits the separation of a child un­der seven
years of age from her mother, "unless the court finds compelling reasons
for such measure, has no immediate relevance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner correctly argues, however, that the reasons relied
upon by the lower court - i.e., "petitioner is not exactly an upright
woman" and "it will be for the welfare of the child" - are not,
strictly speaking, proper grounds in law to deprive a mother of her inherent
right to parental authority over her child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be conceded that minor children - be they legitimate, recognized
natural, adopted, natural by legal fiction or illegitimate, other than natural
as specified in art. 269 of the Civil Code - are by law under the parental
authority of both the father and the mother, or either the father or the mother,
as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we take the view
that on the basis of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> seemingly
unpersuasive factual premises, the petitioner can be deprived of her parental
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while in one breath art.
313 of the Civil Code lays down the rule that "Parental authority cannot
be renounced or transferred, except in cases of guardianship or adoption
approved by the courts, or emancipation by concession," it indicates in
the next that "The courts may, in cases specified by law, deprive parents
of their [parental] authority." And there are indeed valid reasons, as
will presently be expounded, for depriving the petitioner of parental authority
over the minor Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the lower court's finding that the child was given to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span> by <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> with the
knowledge and consent of the pe­titioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In support of this finding, it cited the facts that the peti­tioner did
not at all - not ever - report to the authorities the alleged disappearance of
her daughter, and had not taken any step to see the child when she allegedly
discovered that she was in the custody of the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It discounted the petitioner's claim that she
did not make any move to recover the child because the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>
are powerful and influential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
is bound by the foregoing findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having taken her appeal directly to this Court, she is deemed to have
waived the right to dispute any finding of fact made by the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 332 of the Civil Code provides, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>The courts may deprive the parents of their authority or
suspend the exercise of the same if they should</u> treat their children with
excessive harshness or should give them corrupting orders, coun­sels, or
examples, or should make them beg or <u>abandon them</u>." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Abandonment is therefore one of the
grounds for depriving parents of parental authority over their children.</p>

<p class="BODY">Was the petitioner's acquiescence to the giving by <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> of her child to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>
tantamount to abandonment of the child?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To our mind, mere acquiescence - without more - is not sufficient to
constitute abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the record
yields a host of circumstances which, in their totality, unmistakably betray
the pe­titioner's settled purpose and intention to completely forego all parental
responsibilities and forever relinquish all parental claim in respect to the
child.</p>

<p class="BODY">She surrendered the custody of her child to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span> in 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She waited until 1963, or after the lapse of a period of five long
years, before she brought action to recover custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her claim that she did not take any step to
recover her child because the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span> were
powerful and influential, does not deserve any modicum of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mother who <u>really loves</u> her child
would go to any extent to be reunited with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The natural and nor­mal reaction of the petitioner - once informed, as
she alleged, that her child was in the custody of the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>
- should have been to move heaven and earth, to use a worn-out but still respec­table
cliché, in order to recover her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet she
lifted not a finger.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a matter of record - being the gist of her own unadul­terated
testimony under oath - that she wants the child back so that <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> Lay, the alleged father,
would resume providing the petitioner the support which he peremptorily
withheld and ceased to give when she gave the child away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A woman scorned, she desires to recover the
child as a means of embarrassing <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> who
retrieved the jeep he gave her and altogether stopped living with and
supporting her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the record likewise
reveals that at the pre-trial conducted by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, she
expressed her will­ingness that the child remain with the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>
<u>provided latter would in exchange give her a jeep and some money.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's inconsistent demands in the course of the
proceedings below, reveal that her motives do not flow from the wellsprings of
a loving mother's heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
contrary, they are unmistakably selfish - nay, mercenary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She needs the child as a leverage to obtain
concessions - financial and otherwise - either from the alleged father or the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she
gets the child back, support for her would be forthcoming - or so she thinks -
from the alleged father, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span>
Lay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span> would keep the child, she would agree pro­vided
they gave her a jeep and some money.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the petitioner's attitude, to our mind, does nothing but
confirm her intention to abandon the child - from the very out­set when she allowed
<span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> to give her away to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that the abandonment took
place when the child, barely four months old, was at the most fragile stage of
life and needed the utmost care and solicitude of her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for five long years thereafter she did
not once move to recover the child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
continuously shunned the natural and legal obligations which she owed to the
child; completely withheld her presence, her love, her care, and the opportunity
to display maternal affection; and totally denied her support and
maintenance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her silence and inac­tion
have been prolonged to such a point that her abandonment of the child and her
total relinquishment of parental claim over her, can and should be inferred as
a matter of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Note that this was not the only instance when she gave away a
child of her own flesh and blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
gave up her youngest child, named Betty Tan <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>,
to her <span class="SpellE"><u>comadre</u></span> in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> because she could not support it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of incalculable significance is the fact that nowhere in the
course of the petitioner's lengthy testimony did she ever express a genuine
desire to recover her child Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> - or, for that matter, her other child Betty Tan
<span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> because she loves her, cares for her, and
wants to smother her with motherly affections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Far from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wants Betty Chua
<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> back
so that the alleged father would resume gi­ving her (the petitioner)
support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wants her back to humiliate
and embarrass the respondent <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> who, with her
knowledge and consent, gave the child to the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But - "most un­kindest cut of all"
- she nevertheless signified her readiness to give up the child, in exchange
for a jeep and some money.</p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore affirm the lower court's decision, not on the
grounds cited by it, but upon a ground which the court overlooked - i.e., <u>abandonment</u>
by the petitioner of her child.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Contrast the petitioner's attitude with that of the respon­dents <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> - especially the respondent Flora <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> who, from the moment the child was given to
them, took care of her as if she were her own flesh and blood, had her
baptized, and when she reached school age enrolled her in a reputable exclusive
school for girls.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ironically enough, the real heart-rending tragedy in this case
would consist not in taking the child away from the <span class="SpellE">Cabang­bangs</span>
but in returning her to the custody of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">For, by her own admission, the petitioner has no regular source
of income, and it is doubtful, to say the very least, that she can provide the
child with the barest necessities of life, let alone send her to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no assurance at all that the al­leged
father, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> Lay an
unknown quantity, as far as the record goes - would resume giving the
petitioner support once she and the child are reunited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would then prevent the petitioner from
again doing that which she did before, i.e., give her away?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are of course conjectures, but when the
welfare of a help­less child is at stake, it is the bounden duty of courts -
which they cannot shirk - to respect, enforce, and give meaning and subs­tance
to a child's natural and legal right to live and grow in the proper physical,
moral and intellectual environment.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say that with the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>
spouses, a bright and secure future is guaranteed for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For life is beset at every turn with snares
and pitfalls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the record indubitably
pictures the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> spouses as a, childless
couple of conse­quence in the community, who have given her their name and are
rearing her as their very own child, and with whom there is eve­ry reason to
hope she will have a fair chance of normal growth and development into
respectable womanhood.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, to surrender the girl to the petitioner would be to
assume - quite incorrectly - that only mothers are capable of parental love and
affection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the contrary, this case
precise­ly underscores the homiletic admonition that parental love is not
universal and immutable like a law of natural science.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II.<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner assails as illegal and without basis the award of
the custody of Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> or Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Cabang­bang</span> spouses
upon the grounds, first, that the couple are not re­lated by consanguinity or
affinity to the child, and second, because the answer of the spouses contains
no prayer for the custody of the child.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of any kinship between the child and the <span class="SpellE">Ca­bangbangs</span> alone cannot serve to bar the lower court from
award­ing her custody to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the law provides that in certain cases the custody of a child may be awarded
even to strangers, as against either the father or the mother or against
both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in proceedings involving a
child whose parents are separated - either legally or <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> -
and where it appears that both parents are improper persons to whom, to entrust
the care, custody and control of the child, "the court may either
designate the paternal or ma­ternal grandparent of the child, or his oldest
brother or sister, or <u>some reputable and discreet person</u> to take charge
of such child, or commit it to any suitable asylum, children's home, or
benevolent society."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, sections 6 and 7 of Rule 99 of the Rules of
Court belie the petitioner's contention that the first sentence of art. 363 of
the Civil Code, which states that</p>

<blockquote>"In all questions on the care, custody, edu­cation and
property of children, the latter's welfare shall be paramount. ...,”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">applies only when the litigation
involving a child is between the fa­ther and the mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the policy enunciated in the above
quoted legal provision is of general application, is evident from the use of
the adjective <u>all</u> - meaning, the whole extent or quantity of, the entire
number of, every one of.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, therefore, error to argue that if the suit involving a child's custody
is between a parent and a stranger, the law must necessarily award such custody
to the parent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 7, Rule 99 of the
Rules a Court, precisely contem­plates, among others, a suit between a parent
and a stranger who, in the words of the provision, is "some reputable
resident of the province." <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And
under the authority of the said rule the court - if it is for the best interest
of the child - may take the child away from its parents and commit it to, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, a benevolent person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's contention that the answer of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span> contains no prayer for the retention by them of
the custody of the child, is equally devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The several moves taken by them are clear and
definitive enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, they asked for
her custody <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, they sought the dismissal of the
petition below for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, they added a gene­ral prayer for other <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
just and equitable in the premises. Surely the above <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
prayed for are clearly indicative of the <span class="SpellE">Cabangbangs</span>'
genuine desire to retain the custody of Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III.<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 1, Rule 102 of the Rules of Court provides that "Ex­cept
as otherwise expressly provided by law the writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
shall extend to all cases of illegal confinement or deten­tion by which any
person is deprived of his liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any
person is withheld from the person en­titled thereto." The petitioner has
not proven that she is entitled to the rightful custody of Betty Chua <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> or Grace <span class="SpellE">Cabangbang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the contrary, by want only and
completely shunting aside her legal and moral obligations toward her child, she
