				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Suit originally started in the City Court of Davao City. There, on April 27, 1963, plaintiff—a former sales-girl in defendant's Centro de Modas Tailoring—lodged her complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for unpaid wages, diffential pay, premium pay and overtime pay, amounting to P1,611.90.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><p></p>Plaintiff's complaint was met with defendant's motion to dismiss filed on May 18, 1963 upon the ground of release.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> This motion to dismiss brings to the fore another proceeding before the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. XII, where plaintiff first filed her complaint in February, 1963 against the same defendant, doing business under the name and style of Centro de Modas Tailoring, covering the same cause of action set forth in plaintiff's complaint, namely: non-payment of wages, differential pay, , premium pay, and overtime pay. That proceeding ended in an amicable settlement between the parties set forth in an ''Affidavit of Release" dated February 26, 1963 and executed by plaintiff before Bernardo G. Delfin, Labor Attorney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><p>On June 26, 1963, the City Court, over plaintiff's objection, granted the motion and, dismissed plaintiff's case.</p><p>Plaintiff thereafter elevated the case to the Court of First Instance of Davao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p>On October 3, 1963 the Court of First Instance of Davao —after a review of the record elevated from the City Court—similarly dismissed plaintiff's case upon the same ground of release.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>The present is an appeal registered on November 6, 1963 from the foregoing order of October 3, 1963, "on purely a question of law".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p>We focus attention on plaintiff's Affidavit of Release, which reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"I, LILLIA HERNAEZ, of legal age, married and a resident of Bonifacio Street, Davao City, after having duly sworn in accordance with law, hereby depose and say:&nbsp; </p><p>That I am the same Lilia Hernaez who filed a complaint with the Department of Labor, Davao City, against the Centro de Modas Tailoring for non-payment of wages, differential pay, premium pay and overtime pay and separation pay;&nbsp; </p><p>That acting upon my said claim, Atty. Bernardo G. Delfin, Labor Attorney, set a conference between me and the one against whom I hae filed my complaint;&nbsp; </p><p>That during the conference, the Centro de Modas, represented by Miss Fely Yan, and <em>I have agreed to settle the same amicably;</em>&nbsp; </p><p>That during the amicable settlement, <em>I was paid all my claims</em> against the Centro dc Modas, through Atty. Delfin;&nbsp; </p><p>That by virtue of the said <em>amicable settlement to my full satisfactio</em>n, I am executing this affidavit for the purpose of informing all and sundry of our said settlement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p></blockquote><p>For, indeed, the dismissals both in the City Court and in the Court of First instance are anchored exclusively on the value given the foregoing affidavit.</p><p>Plaintiff's complaint seeks relief for non-payment of wages, differential pay, premium pay and overtime pay. The release likewise covers the very same claim of plaintiff for non-payment of wages, differential pay, premium pay and overtime pay. Concretely, the claim before the court and the previous one before the Department of Labor, refer exactly to the same cause of action. That claim was amicably settled. The affidavit recites that plaintiff was paid all her claims against the Centra de Modas Tailoring thru Labor Attorney Bernardo G. Delfin.</p><p>Plaintiff does not impugn the genuineness and due execution of the affidavit of release she subscribed and swore to. There is no intimation that fraud, threat or intimidation vitiated that document. There is no charge that the settlement was executed through mistake or undue influence. It was voluntary; more, it was to her <em>full</em> satisfaction. The amicable settlement entered into is valid and binding. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The law looks at compromise with favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p>But plaintiff seeks to downgrade the legal effects of the release. She puts forward the averment that it amounts to a waiver of her claim for compensation and defeats the provisions of Commonwealth Acts 303 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and 444. Plaintiff is laboring under a misconception. Waiver "is the intentional relinquishment of a known right".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Here, there is no such known right. Nothing in the record suggests that plaintiff's claim had ever been fully-established or liquidated in the Department of Labor. There simply was a compromise, an amicable settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Said compromise is valid and binding, "not because it is the settlement of a valid claim, but because it is the settlement of a controversy"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> brought to the Labor Department. And, compromise is a ground for motion to dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p>The issue here raised is by no means untrodden ground. In 1956, in the Mercader case, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this Court was at grips with a similar problem. Plaintiff therein was employed by the Manila Polo Club as a bookkeeper and accountant. His services having been terminated, plaintiff lodged a claim for P10,000.00 in the Department of Labor. The proceedings there ended with plaintiff signing the receipt (Exhibit 1) for P7,000.00 "in full settlement of any and all claims, including overtime work, vacation and sick leave privileges, which said Alejandro Mercader has or may have against the Manila Polo Club." This notwithstanding, plaintiff sued defendant in court praying for P5,000.00 by way of actual and compensatory damages; P50,000.00, moral damages; P2.000.00, attorney's fees; and P200.00, litigation expenses. This Court there held that "by virtue of said settlement, plaintiff lost any action against the defendant Manila Polo Club in connection with his employment and separation from said Club." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Paraphrasing the opinion of this court in a labor case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the <em>compromise</em> now before us has the force of law between plaintiff and defendant, and may not be unilaterally jettisoned by plaintiff, one of the parties thereto.</p><p>Upon the premises, the order of October 8, 1963 appealed from should be, as it is, hereby affirmed. No costs allowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> So ordered.</p><p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P. </em>and <em>Zaldlvar, JJ.,</em> concur.</p><p><em>Order affirmed.</em></p><p><br>&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Civil Case No. 284-B, entitled Lilia Hernaez, plaintiff <em><em>vs.</em></em> Yan Kao, defendant.<p></p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Amended complaint registered in the City Court on May 14, 1963.<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>Section 1 (g) Rule 8 of the 1940 Rules of Court provides that a defendant may file a motion to dismiss the action on the ground:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"That the claim or demand set forth in the plaintiff's pleading has been released."
