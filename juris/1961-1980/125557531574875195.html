				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Teodoro N.  Pepito, et al. filed  before the Court  of  First
    
Instance of Bukidnon on January 19,  1963 a  petition for
    

    

    
  <em>quo warranto </em>wherein they disputed  the right of Lucilo
    
Alkuino, et al. to hold the positions of mayor, vice-mayor
    
and councilors, respectively, of the Municipality of Valencia,
    
Province  of   Bukidnon  (Civil  Case  No. 239).   Vicente
    
Cabiling, et al. also filed a similar petition of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto
    
</span>before the same court on  January 13,  1963 questioning
    
the right  of Eusebio Pabualan, et al. to hold the positions
    
of Mayor, vice-mayor  and  councilors  of the Municipality
    
of Dangcagan, Province of Bukidnon (Civil Case (No. 240).
    
And Benjamin  Belisario  likewise filed  a <i>quo  warranto</i> case before the  same court on January 2, 1963 questioning the right of  Marcelo  Ramirez to  hold the position
    
of secretary  of the Municipality of Valencia, Province
    
of Bukidnon  (Civil Case  No. 243).
    

<p>The respondents  in the three  cases above-mentioned
      
filed their respective answers in due time, and upon agreement of the  parties,  they were  tried  jointly.  On June
      
7, 1963, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, after the reception of the evidence
      
renders  decision upholding the right  of petitioners therein to the  positions of  which they were  allegedly deprived
      
by respondents awarding to them the salaries and emoluments pertinent thereto from the date of  their removal
      
until  their reinstatement,  with costs against respondents.</p>
<p>On June  10,  1963,  copies of the decision were served
        
both upon petitioners and  respondents, thru their  counsel.
        
On the same  date,  in the  afternoon, petitioners filed an
        
urgent motion for execution setting  the hearing thereof
        
on  June 13,  1963.  On June 11,  1963,  respondents  filed
        
their notice of appeal in the three cases, as well as their
        
corresponding cash bonds.  Because  of the appeal  they
        
interposed respondents registered  their opposition to the
        
motion for execution but, notwithstanding said  opposition,
        
the court <em>a  quo</em> granted  the  motion ordering  forthwith
        
the immediate execution of the decision.  In its order the
        
court <em>a quo </em>stated
the special reasons why in its opinion the issuance of the writ was
justified. And considering that the writ of execution was null and void
for the reason that it has been issued after the court had lest
jurisdiction over the case, respondents interposed the present petition
for certiorari.</p>
<p>This Court gave due course to the petition and issued
          
 the  preliminary injunction prayed  for without bond.</p>
<p>It appears that the decision of the court <i>a quo</i> was  rendered  on  June 7, 1963, copies of which were served upon
            
 the  parties  on  June  10,  1963.   It also appears  that on
            
 the  same date,  in the  afternoon, petitioners therein,  now 
            
 respondents, filed an urgent motion  for execution setting
            
 the  hearing thereof on June 13, 1963. And on  June 11,
            
 1963,  respondents therein, now petitioners,  filed their
            
 notice of appeal in the three cases, together with  the corresponding cash bonds.  It is  now contended that when
            
 the  court <i>a quo</i> granted the motion  for execution in its
            
 order of July 10, 1963, it no longer  had jurisdiction over
            
 the  case  for the reason  that respondents therein,  now
            
 petitioners, had  already filed  their notice  of appeal  and
            
 cash bonds long before, or on June  11, 1963.  In other
            
 words,  the theory of respondents, now petitioners, is that
            
 upon the filing of said  notice of appeal and bonds, tho appeal is deemed perfected,  and  consequently, the court  has
            
 thereby lost its jurisdiction over the  case  except  to issue
            
 orders  for the protection  and preservation of the rights
            
 of the parties which do not involve any matter  litigated
            
 by the  appeal under Section  9,  Rule 41, of the Rules of
            
Court.</p>
<p> There is no merit  in this  contention:   Note that  the
              
 urgent  motion  for execution was filed on  June 10, 1963,
              
 when no notice of appeal has as yet been filed on  the part
              
 of the  losing party.  It was only on  June 11, 1963.  the
              
next day,   when  respondents  therein, now  petitioners,
              
 filed their  notice of appeal and cash appeal bonds. They
              
 have even  filed  on the same date, June 11, 1963, a motion to
              
     
              

              
postpone the hearing of the motion for execution.  From
              
these facts it is clear that the court <i>a quo</i>  could still act
              
on the motion for execution filed on June 10, 1963 because
              
it was filed ahead of the notice of appeal and cash bonds
              
filed by petitioners herein.  It cannot be successfully contended that  the mere filing of the notice of appeal and
              
cash bonds has the  effect of nullifying  the motion  for
              
execution filed one day  ahead for that would  sanction a
              
precedent wherein a party to a  case, by the mere filing
              
of the notice  of  appeal and appeal bond,  may deprive
              
the court of its authority to act  upon a motion  that has
              
already been placed within  its jurisdiction.   As this Court
              
has  aptly said: "To hold  that,  in the present case, the
              
mere filing of the notice  of appeal, and the filing or deposit
              
of cash  bond with  the  clerk of  court  has automatically
              
deprived the trial court  of its jurisdiction over this case,
              
would  be to practically  nullify  the discretionary  power
              
granted  said court by section 2,  Rule 39, to order, upon
              
good reasons,  the execution  of  its judgment  before  the
              
expiration of the time  to appeal; because in all  cases
              
the judgment debtor may,  on the very  day the judgment
              
is rendered or  notified to  him, file notice of appeal and
              
deposit of P60.00  as  cash bond with the clerk  of court."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2 style1 style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p> Moreover,  in case of cash bond,  mere  deposit of the
                
amount of P60.00  with the clerk of court is not sufficient.
                
Notice of such deposit upon the  adverse party is still necessary, as well as its submission to the court for approval,
                
in order that the adverse party may object to the amount
                
of the bond and the court may decide whether  to approve
                
the  bond,  or fix  a different amount. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2 style1 style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> In  other words,
                
mere filing of the cash  bond is  not sufficient.  It is still
                
necessary that it  be approved by the court.  Therefore,
                
before this is done, the appeal cannot be deemed perfected
                
               
                

                

                
 so as to deprive the  court  of its jurisdiction over the    case.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2 style1 style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
<p> Here, it does not  appear that  the  appeal bonds  had
                  
 already been approved  by the  court <em>a  quo</em>
when it acted on the motion for execution. The approval of the
requisite appeal bonds by the Justice of the Peace of Malaybalay,
Bukidnon, cannot be considered valid it appearing that the judge
presiding the court <em>a quo</em> was not absent   
                  
 from his district when  the alleged approval was stamped 
                  
 by said justice  of the peace.</p>
<p>As to whether there  are good  reasons  justifying the
                    
 immediate execution of  the decision of the court  <em>a quo</em>,
                    
 suffice it to  quote hereunder what  said court says  on the
                    
matter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the cases at bar, stronger and more compelling reasons exist
                        
 than in  the Mabutas <i>versus</i>
Alzate case which involved only the position of a high school
principal, to warrant immediate execution of the judgment. This Court
is aware that since June, 1962 when the respondents were appointed to
their respective positions, a state of confusion ensued in the
municipalities concerned because two sets of municipal officials
claimed to be rightfully entitled to the office and pretended to
discharge its functions. In the municipality of Dangcagan two Chiefs of
Police appointed by the contending Municipal Mayors performed the
duties of the position, and criminal complaints had to be referred on
many occasions to the constabulary before they could be filed in court.
Varied official matters and transactions have been the object of
wrangling and dispute between the two sets of municipal officials in
the above-mentioned municipalities. The controversy in Dangcagan
reached a point wherein the Provincial Commander and the Provincial
Fiscal had to rush there to prevent bloodshed between the warring
factions on the occasion of the transfer of the seat of government from
the town proper of the barrio of Kitaotao last March, 1963. Complaints
from various residents of said municipalities about whom to deal with
in official matters have been brought to the attention of the Court.
Further continuation of the existing state of chaos obtaining in the
above-stated municipalities pending the final disposition of these
cases on appeal will aggravate the injury to the public service which
could not be allowed to pass with unconcern."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Wherefore, petition  is denied.   The writ  of injunction
