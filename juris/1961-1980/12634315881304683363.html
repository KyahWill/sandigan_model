and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> to <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span> to an
indeterminate penalty of six years and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>

and ordered them to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to the heirs of
Felix Ortega P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> as indemnity plus P20,000 as
moral and exemplary damages (Criminal Case No. 1318).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>
appealed from that judgment which was based on the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">At around ten-thirty in the evening of September 22, 1972, Felix
Ortega, 38, married to Patricia <span class="SpellE">Dilabaltan</span>, a
security guard of the <span class="SpellE">Lainez</span> Security Guard Agency at
Pier 2, and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> <span class="SpellE">Puting</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, was surrounded
and assaulted by <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>, 19; <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>,
alias Boy <span class="SpellE">Gaya</span>, 22; <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>,
alias Boy <span class="SpellE">Kalbo</span>, 17; Boy <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tangkad</span> and one named Nestor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assault was perpetrated near the outpost and <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> gas station at Pier 4, <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That place was illuminated by electric lamps
on <span class="GramE">the</span> street and in the outpost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The five assailants were armed with bladed
weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ortega tried to evade their
blows by stooping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reminded his
attackers that he was their comrade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record does not show the motive for the assault and how it started.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the assault, Ortega, who was mortally wounded, was brought
to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Mary</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Johnston</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> where he died upon arrival
at about ten-fifty-five on that same night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The medico-legal officer of the Manila Metropolitan Police performed an autopsy
on his body at two-quarter in the morning of the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corpse was identified by the victim's
sister, <span class="SpellE">Fely</span> <span class="SpellE">Arabihan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy disclosed that Ortega sustained four stab wounds
which penetrated his lung and liver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
location of the stab wounds implies that there was more than one
assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One fatal stab was on the <u>left
side</u> of the chest; another was on the <u>right side</u> of the chest; a
third was on the <u>front part</u> of the chest, and the fourth on the <u>back</u>
of the chest (lateral <u>posterior</u> left chest).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim also had a lacerated wound on the
chin and an abrasion on the lower lip.</p>

<p class="BODY">The stabbing was witnessed at close range by Vicky <span class="SpellE">Agaton</span> <span class="SpellE">Derima</span>, 30, married, and a
vendor of crabs at the <st1:city><st1:place>Asuncion</st1:place></st1:city>
market in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(She sold in that market the catch of the fishing boat owned by her and
her husband, Rudy <span class="SpellE">Derima</span>, a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driver.) She was allegedly at Pier 4 at past <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten
 o'clock</st1:time> on that night of <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="9">September
 22, 1972</st1:date> because she was waiting for a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
to take her to her residence at <st1:street><st1:address>156 <span class="SpellE">Dulo</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> <span class="SpellE">Puting</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">She was acquainted with the victim and with three of his
assailants, namely, <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was a member of the Manila Citizens' Police which was under the
supervision of a certain Major Adolfo of Precinct 1 of the Manila Metropolitan
Police located at <st1:street><st1:address>North Bay Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Balut</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tondo</span></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> was a
resident of <st1:street><st1:address>93 <span class="SpellE">Dulo</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
the same street where Vicky resided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Llanto</span> was a resident of Breakwater, <span class="SpellE">Isla</span>
<span class="SpellE">Puting</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, while <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> was a resident of <st1:street><st1:address>630 <span class="SpellE">Pitong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatang</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boy <span class="SpellE">Oxo</span> was killed later by a member of the Metropolitan Police
Command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nestor went into hiding and had
not been apprehended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> were members of the citizens' police patrol which
was organized to maintain peace and order in <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> <span class="SpellE">Puting</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted above, Vicky was also a member of
that organization.</p>

<p class="BODY">After witnessing the assault, Vicky rushed home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was confused and gripped with fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not notice what the assailants did
after the assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told a friend
named Elsie about the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elsie
reported the matter to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
that same night, Vicky was questioned by the police but she did not sign any
statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her statement was taken on <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1972</st1:date> by an investigator of the homicide
division of the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> police force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the investigation, she identified <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> as three of the five assailants whom she saw
stabbing Ortega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three were arrested
by operatives of Precinct 1 on the preceding day, October 7.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Aniano</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
21, a resident of Breakwater, <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> <span class="SpellE">Puting</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>,
saw the assault upon Ortega because, like Vicky <span class="SpellE">Agaton</span>
<span class="SpellE">Derima</span>, he happened to be at Pier 4, the scene of the
crime, waiting to board a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> which would take
him to <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> <span class="SpellE">Puting</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Vicky
was near the assailants, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was on the other side of the street about eight meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw Vicky witnessing the assault.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was acquainted with Vicky and with the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> used to
frequent his place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the next
day <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> went to his place and said that, although
Ortega was wounded, he fought back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was a member of the assailants' gang.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he did not join them in staging holdups.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
who also knew the victim, Ortega, and his family, was investigated by the
police after the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told the
policemen that <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> wounded Ortega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not able to give any statement because
he was under protective custody at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
since he was being molested by the assailants of Ortega.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 9, 1972, or one day after Vicky's statement was taken
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2), <span class="GramE">an information</span> for
murder was filed against <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the trial, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> pleaded the same alibi, which was that at the time
the incident happened, they were in <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> working as <span class="SpellE"><u>cargadores</u></span>
in the branch office of the Rice and Corn Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their alibi was confirmed by their alleged
foreman, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, 29, who presented a
notebook allegedly containing the <u>vales</u> or petty loans obtained by <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> and other
laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, as correctly pointed out by the trial court, the said
notebook does not exculpate <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> because it was not properly kept and it contains
many missing pages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the entries
were not made by <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Duero</span></st1:place> but by
an unnamed person who did not testify in court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Llanto's</span> alibi was that when the
incident occurred, he was in his house at Breakwater, <span class="SpellE">Isla</span>
<span class="SpellE">Puting</span> <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court did not give credence to the
alibis of the three accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Llanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> did not appeal
from the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> in this appeal contends that the
trial court erred in believing the testimonies of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Vicky <span class="SpellE">Agaton</span> <span class="SpellE">Derima</span>, in
not sustaining his alibi, and in not acquitting him on the ground of reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> admitted that he was acquainted
with his co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asked to explain why Vicky implicated him in
the killing of Ortega, <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> declared that Vicky had
a grudge against him because he was a member of the <span class="SpellE">Zoto</span>
Organization and Vicky was a former member thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was allegedly expelled because she spent
its money.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rebuttal, Vicky denied <span class="SpellE">Erispe's</span>
imputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She explained that she
resigned from the <span class="SpellE">Zoto</span> organization because of its
bad practices such as selling the land of the government for P200.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She surmised that the accused smeared her
character because she did not cooperate with them in implementing their nefarious
enterprises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She disclosed that <span class="SpellE">Erispe's</span> brother-in-law offered to pay her any amount if
she would desist from testifying against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's counsel, with much zeal and diligence, subjected the
testimonies of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Derima</span> to a painstaking scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noted some contradictions or
inconsistencies therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He vehemently
contends that those discrepancies impaired the credibility of the two
prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">However, the Solicitor General in his brief competently refuted
appellant's arguments and conclusions.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the alleged contradictions do not destroy the
probative value of the testimonies of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Derima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They did not <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> pervert the truth nor
perpetrate deliberate lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisive
fact is that they were present when the accused ganged up on Ortega and made a
concerted effort to injure and kill him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The inconsistencies pertained to minor details which would not justify
the exoneration of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the record does not show any reason or motive as to why Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Derima</span> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
would frame up appellant <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> and impute to him a
capital offense which he did not commit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His alibi is not credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing is murder qualified by abuse of superiority, a
circumstance alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
was correctly imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment against appellant <span class="SpellE">Erispe</span> is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the appellant.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
