of Iloilo, Branch III, issued in Civil Case No. 9660 entitled "Angelica <span class="SpellE">Viajar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Viajar</span>, plaintiffs, versus Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February
 </span>15, 1974</st1:date>, plaintiffs-petitioners filed a complaint for the
recovery of possession of property premised on the allegations that they were
the registered <span class="GramE">owners</span> <u>pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></u>
of a parcel of agricultural land at <span class="SpellE">Guibuangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
with an area of 2.0089 hectares, more or less, identified as Lot No. 7340, <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span> Cadastre and more particularly described as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A parcel of land (Lot No. 7340 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>, with improvements thereon situated in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span> and bounded on the Northeast
by Lot No. 7339; in the Southeast by Lot No. 7342; Southwest by Lots Nos. 7341
&amp; 7470 and on the West by the <span class="SpellE">Suage</span> River."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">their</span> ownership
thereof being evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-77367 of the
Register of Deeds of Iloilo, (par. 2, Complaint); that the above-described
parcel of land was acquired through purchase by the plaintiffs on September 6,
1973 following which they caused to be undertaken by a licensed Geodetic
Engineer the relocation survey of the property for the purpose of determining
the exact metes and bounds thereof. (par. 3, Complaint); that as a result of
the said relocation survey, plaintiffs came to know and discover that the
northeastern half portion of Lot No. 7340 has been eaten up and occupied by the
new waterbed of the <span class="SpellE">Suage</span> River as a result of the
natural change in its course, while the remaining southwestern portion of the
property is occupied and possessed by defendant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span>
(par. 4, Complaint); that plaintiffs also later came to know that the defendant
has occupied and possessed for more than (2) years not only the aforesaid
Parcel 2 but also the old abandoned riverbed of the <span class="SpellE">Suage</span>
River which was the original boundary on the West of the land in question, Lot
No. 7340 (par. 5, Complaint); that the northeastern portion of their property
having been occupied by the new riverbed of the <span class="SpellE">Suage</span>
River, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, plaintiffs have become by law <u>ipso</u>
<u>facto</u> the owners of the aforesaid abandoned riverbed in proportion to
the area they lost (par. 6, Complaint); that notwithstanding demands made by
the plaintiffs, defendant without any justifiable reason has refused and until
now still refuses to vacate the aforesaid area occupied by him or surrender the
possession thereof to the plaintiffs to the latter's great damage and prejudice
in the amount of P6,000.00 per year, P5,000.00 for moral damages and P500.00
for expenses of litigation (pars. 7, 8 and 9, Complaint).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer dated March 12, 1974, defendant-respondent Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span> denied the substantial allegations in the complaint
and averred as special and affirmative defenses that he is the owner of Lot No.
7511 situated at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Cawayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span>,
Iloilo, which lot is bounded on the east by <span class="SpellE">Suague</span>
River (par. 6, Answer); that since 1926 or 1927, the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span>
River gradually deposited soil accumulations on the eastern portion of Lot 7511
which the defendant promptly took possession and worked the same as his own as
soon as said <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River gradually, slowly and
consistently moved farther to the East (par. 7, Answer); that Lot 7340 claimed
by plaintiffs and allegedly titled in their names, is separated from Lot 7511
of the defendant by the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River, and the gradual
action of the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River, admitted by the
plaintiffs in their complaint, had eaten up said lot 7340 (par. 8, Answer);
that the land in dispute which is indicated as parcel 2, Lot 7340, of Annex
"A" of the complaint, as well as the old <span class="SpellE">Suague</span>
River bed, is the soil accumulation or accretion attached to Lot 7511, owned by
the defendant (par. 9, Answer); that defendant possessed the portions formed by
the accumulations of soil deposits made by the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span>
River gradually from 1926-27 up to 1940, at the latest, when the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River remained on a more or less stationary course
up to the present (par. 10, Answer); that defendant is owner of the soil
accumulations and the dried up riverbed now attached to his Lot 7511 (par. 11,
Answer).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-respondent filed as
counterclaim the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> for attorney's
fees and P5,000.00 as moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a reply filed on April 4, 1974, plaintiffs-petitioners averred
that they never admitted that the change in the course of the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River was through a gradual action resulting to an
accumulation of soil deposits to the eastern part of Lot No. 7511 owned by the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs had emphatically
and continuously insisted that the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River
changed its course through natural action by passing through the northeastern
portion of Lot No. 7340 owned by plaintiffs (par. 1, Reply); that said lot in
question indicated as Parcel 2 of Lot No. 7340 of Annex "B" is not
the soil accumulation or accretions attached to Lot No. 7511 owned by defendant
inasmuch as parcel 2 retains its identity, and in fact the old river bed of <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River formerly running between Lot No. 7511 and Lot
No. 7340 is still existing (par. 2, Reply); that the defense of accretion
interposed by defendant in the instant case does not apply; instead it falls
within the contemplation of Article 461 of the New Civil Code on change of
course of rivers (par. 4, Reply); and that by reason of the natural change of
the course of the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span> River, the abandoned river
bed which is existing as admitted by defendant himself, exclusively belongs to
the plaintiffs for reasons above stated (par. 5, Reply).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1974</st1:date>,
plaintiffs-petitioners amended their <span class="GramE">complaint by</span> <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Te as
defendant from whom they purchased the land in question upon the<span style=""> </span>latter's assurance that the title is
clean and the land<span style="">holding is not
possessed nor subject to any lien, encumbrances or claims by third
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs-petitioners prayed
in the alternative that should possession of defendant-respondent Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span> be sustained, an order be issued annulling the
contract of sale and direct the vendor <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Te to
return the purchase price thereof with interest from the date of execution of
the sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendant-respondent <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> </span>Te <span style="">filed
his own answer to the amended complaint acknowledging the deed of sale but
alleging that he only sold to plaintiffs-petitioners whatever rights he had
over the property under the Torrens Title and Tax Declaration over the land
transferred to him by the original owner; that complainants are precluded from
including defendant <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Te in the case because
the former had never previously demanded from the said vendor the cancellation of
the sale, but on the contrary, plaintiffs-petitioners have always maintained
that they were entitled as a matter of right to the ownership of the remaining
portion of Lot No. 7340 and the dry riverbed which are under the possession of
defendant <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="8"><span style="">August 8,
 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">,
defendant-respondent Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span> filed a Motion
for Summary Judgment dismissing the action of plaintiffs and declaring
defendant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span> the owner of the land in
question on the basis of the alleged admission of the plaintiffs in their
complaint as well as of the law and jurisprudence on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quoting par. 4 of the complaint which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"That as a result of
the said re</span>location survey, plaintiffs came to <span style="">know and discover that the north</span>eastern half portion of Lot No.

as a result of the natural change in its course, while the remaining
southwestern portion of the property is occupied and possessed by defendant
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span>,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">movant</span></span><span style=""> Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span> argues that said allegation
of plaintiffs is an admission on their part that the change of course of the
river was gradual and not sudden or abrupt; that it is therefore a case of <span class="SpellE">alluvion</span> in Article 457 of the Civil Code (366 of the Old
Civil Code) and not abandoned river bed in Article 461 of the Civil Code (370
of the Old Civil Code) as in the latter the change of course is sudden or
abrupt; that being <span class="SpellE">alluvion</span>, the land in question is
accreted land on Lot 7511 (Article 457 of the Civil Code; Article 366 of the
Old Civil Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Te filed his
"Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment" on the ground that there
is a clear controversy between the parties as to how the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Suague</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
had changed its course, whether abruptly as contended by the plaintiffs and
defendant <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Te or gradually as contended by
defendant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
claims that the abandoned river bed which in reality does not form part of Lots
Nos. 7511 and 7340 is likewise involved in the case and the question as to whom
such land should now belong is also a matter of controversy.</p>

filed, counsel for petitioners moved for the certification of the case to the
Supreme Court after realizing that the appeal involves pure questions of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted by the
Seventh Division of the Court of Appeals in the resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1976</st1:date> which certified the
case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> for final determination pursuant to Section

docketed as G.R. No. L-45321 and consolidated with G.R. No. L-43882, a petition
for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the same summary judgment filed by
plaintiffs-petitioners in the meantime on July 2, 1976 and given due course as
a special civil action in Our resolution of September 1, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having considered the petition as an original action, the
principal issue is whether or not the trial court gravely abused its discretion
in deciding the case by Summary Judgment dated <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs-petitioners contend that the lower court erred in
promulgating summary judgment in view of the questions of fact disputed in the
pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that by
invoking Article 461 of the Civil Code in relation to their allegation that
there was a natural change in the course of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Suague</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
they, in effect, alleged the abrupt or sudden change in the course of the
waters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They point out that this
contention was contradicted by defendant-respondent Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span>
in his answer when the latter claimed that the change was instead gradual under
the contemplation of Article 457 of the same Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, this defendant-respondent
supports the propriety of the summary judgment on the ground that the complaint
failed to aver categorically the sudden and abrupt change in the course of the
river, but on the contrary, the allegation therein that the land was eaten up by
the current amounts to an admission on the part of complainants that the change
was in fact gradual.</p>

<p class="BODY">From a careful reading of the complaint and answer, there are two
conflicting theories respecting the occurrence of a natural phenomenon, the
effects and consequences of which are governed either by Article 461<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

before the trial court is to determine whether there actually occurred an
abrupt and sudden change of the water current, or that the river had gradually
veered through </span>the years leaving alluvial deposit of soil now composing
the portion claimed by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot subscribe to the interpretation that the phrase
"eaten up and occupied by the new waterbed" imports an admission by
plaintiffs-petitioners of a gradual action of the water current, thus stripping
the complaint of its only contestable issue, and hence, needs only to be
disposed of in a summary judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
hold that the phrase "eaten up" is a vague expression of what
complainants wanted to convey, since the phrase can either mean gradual or
sudden action of the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
ambiguity, though, cannot deprive the complaint of its merit because the
pleader is required to state only the ultimate facts constituting his cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, by the reading of the
entire complaint, it is clear enough that the pleader did not take its own
expression to mean the gradual shifting of the river current, so much so that
defendant-respondent in his answer countered with a diametrically opposed
explanation as demonstrated in his factual allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, plaintiffs-petitioners in their
reply alleged that they never admitted that the change in the course of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Suague</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was through a gradual action resulting to an accumulation of soil deposits to
the eastern part of the lot owned by defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, co-defendant <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Te
conceded in his answer to the amended complaint that the <span class="SpellE">Suague</span>
River <u>suddenly</u> changed its course by channeling its bed at the
northeastern strip of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 7340 (Records, p.
28).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the interests of
the parties clashed on the proprietary effect of the natural phenomenon, the
issue all the more became genuine and ripe for adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs-petitioners claim ownership over
the abandoned riverbed in proportion to the area they lost when the river
opened a new channel within their property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, defendant-respondent Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Ladrido</span>
claims ownership to the disputed portion because it consists of accretion
attached to his land as a result of the gradual accumulation of soil brought by
the action of the water current.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
these conflicting claims, a factual dispute certainly arises which can only be
properly settled by means of a trial on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Summary judgment was therefore, unwarranted.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Relief by summary judgment is intended to expedite or promptly
dispose of cases where the facts appear undisputed and certain from the
pleadings, depositions, admissions and affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if there be a doubt as to such facts and
there be an issue or issues of fact joined by the parties, neither one of them
can pray for a summary judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
the facts pleaded by the parties are disputed or contested, proceedings for a
summary judgment cannot take the place of a trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the Rules will readily show that a summary
judgment is by no means a hasty one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
assumes a scrutiny of facts in a <u>summary hearing</u> after the filing of a
motion for summary judgment by one party supported by affidavits, depositions,
admissions, or other documents, with notice upon the adverse party who may file
an opposition to the motion supported also by affidavits, depositions, or other
documents (Section 3, Rule 34).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In spite
of its expediting character, relief by summary judgment can only be allowed
after compliance with the minimum requirement of vigilance by the court in a
summary hearing considering that this remedy is in derogation of a party's
right to a plenary trial of his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
any rate, a party who moves for summary judgment has the burden of
demonstrating clearly the absence of any genuine issue of fact, or that the
issue posed in the complaint is so patently unsubstantial as not to constitute
a genuine issue for trial, and any doubt as to the existence of such an issue
is resolved against the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that in the case at bar, the aforementioned guidelines
were not observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere reliance on
an "admission" arrived at by construction and dubitable by its terms,
rather than a clear and positive concession cannot be a basis for a summary
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's motion is not
supported by an affidavit of merit or any document attesting the state of facts
relied upon in the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has
the court afforded the parties a hearing on both the motion and opposition to
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the trial court in
cursorily issuing a summary judgment, committed a correctible error.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> </span>the summary judgment is set aside and the
case is hereby remanded to the trial court <span style="">for </span>further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without <span style="">costs.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
