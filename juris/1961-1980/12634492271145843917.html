				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An action for recovery of possession of land was filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1963</st1:date> by Beatriz G. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Leandro</span> <span class="SpellE">Balagot</span>, <span style="">in </span>the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff alleged in her complaint that she
is the registered owner of 1,296 square meters of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No.
52577 of the Registry of Deeds of said city, issued in her name on September 6,
1960; that she had purchased the same from J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tua­son</span>
&amp; Co., then the registered owner of the land under Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 49235; that "prior to September 6, 1960 up to the present”
defendant has been in possession of a portion of about 600 square meters of
said parcel of land, without the knowledge and tolerance of J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., and that in spite of demands on him by
plaintiff and her predecessor-in-interest, defen­dant has failed and refused to
vacate the land and re­move his house and other construction thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant, on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="2">February
 12, 1963</st1:date>, filed an ans­wer with a counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleged therein were that the portion of land
occupied by defendant, an area of 700 square meters, was part of the 50 <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">quiñones</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>of land first owned by <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> <span style="">in </span>1873;
that from Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, successor-in-interest of <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>, he bought the portion of land in question for
P4,900.00 on August 30, 1950; that right after the sale, he took possession of <span style="">the land, subsequently constructing thereon a
house worth P40,000.00; that pursuant to an agreement between J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., and the <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
heirs dated March 16, 1953, defendant's right to the land has preference over
the sale in favor of plaintiff; that, therefore, plaintiff should <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the portion of the land involved </span><span style="">herein </span><span style="">to defendant or pay him P4,900.00 for the land, P40,000.00 for his
house, and P5,000.00 for attorney’s fees and da­mages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="2">February
 19, 1963</st1:date>, answered defendant's counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="3">March
 14, 1963</st1:date> the court set the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prior to this scheduled date, however, on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1963</st1:date>, defendant filed <span style="">a </span>motion for leave to file a
third-party complaint, attaching the same to the motion, against J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>,
for payment of the value of the house and lot in case of eviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, served with notice of the motion, opposed it on April <span style="">6, </span>1963, stating that a third-party
complaint to enforce the warranty of eviction should have been filed before the
time for filing the answer, citing Article <span style="">1559, </span>Civil Code; and that the <span class="SpellE">Tuason-Deudor</span>
agreement defen­dant mentioned has been declared rescinded, citing this Court's
ruling in J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>, L-­16836, January 30, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said defendant's motion was denied on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1963</st1:date>, "for lack of
merit".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the order denying his
motion for leave to file a third-party complaint defendant ap­pealed to the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was
certified to <span class="GramE">Us</span> since the Court of Appeals found it to
involve ques­tions purely of law, namely:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) Is the third-party complaint admissible or not?</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) May the order denying the admission of the third-party
complaint <span class="GramE">be</span> appealed from at this stage of the
proceedings?</p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule the admission of a third-party complaint is left to the
discretion of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre­sent
case, however, involves a third-party complaint seek­ing to enforce a vendor's
warranty in case of eviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
pursuant to express provision of Article 1558 of <span style="">the </span>Civil Code, a defendant-vendee in a suit for eviction must
summon in said suit his <span class="GramE">vendor,</span> otherwise the latter
shall not be obliged to make good his aforesaid warranty:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. <span style="">1558.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The vendor shall not be obliged to
make good the proper warranty, unless he is summoned in the suit for eviction
at the instance of the vendee.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> contention is
that this sum­moning of the vendor should take place before the answer is
filed, under Art. <span style="">1559 </span>of the
Civil Code:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. <span style="">1559<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The</span></span></span> defendant vendor shall ask, within the time
fixed in the Rules of Court for answering the complaint, that the vendor be
made a co-defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The act of summoning the vendor can be accomplished either under
Article <span style="">1559 </span>of the Civil Code,
by asking that said vendor be made a co-defendant, in which case the request
should be made within the time for answering the complaint; or thru the <span style="">filing </span>of a third-party complaint
against said vendor, under Sec. 1, Rule 12, now Sec. 12 of Rule <span style="">6 </span>of the Rules of Court, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 12.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Third-party complaint</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A third-party complaint is <span style="">a claim </span>that
a defending party may, with leave of court, file against a person not a party
to the action, called the third-party defendant, for contribution, in­demnity,
subrogation or any other relief, in respect of his opponent's claim."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the first case, the vendor is summoned by being made a
co-defendant; in the second, by being made a third-party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this it can be seen that <span style="">a </span>third-party
complaint filed after the answer but before trial is not late; Article <span style="">1559's </span>time-limit does not apply
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Sec. 2 of Rule 12 of the
old Rules of Court, then applicable, provided that after service of his ans­wer,
defendant may, with notice to plaintiff, <span class="GramE">move</span> for
leave as third-party plaintiff to file a complaint against a third-party
defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">As adverted to above, in this case, the third-party complaint, as
against Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, seeks enforcement of the
warranty against eviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is
thus required by law to be resorted to instead of being left to be filed as a
separate action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not raised in the
action for eviction, the same will not <span style="">prosp</span>er<span style=""> </span>and the vendor will be released from
his warranty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only does the
admission of the third-party complaint against Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deu­dor</span>,
avoid multiplicity of suits; it is necessary for de­fendant to enforce said
warranty against his vendor.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., and
defendant, however, no relationship of vendor and vendee obtains and the
third-party complaint does not partake of the nature of an enforcement of a
warranty against eviction; rather, it seeks to enforce the <span class="SpellE">Tuason-Deudor</span>
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the trial court
properly disallowed the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article <span style="">1558 </span>of the Civil Code requires
defendant in eviction to summon to the suit his vendor, in this case Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>; <span style="">non-parties
to the sale, such as J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., do not
have to be summoned therein; hence, there being no necessity for inclusion of
J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., the dis­allowance of the
third-party complaint against it was </span>not erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the <span class="SpellE">appealability</span> of the order
disallowing the third-party complaint against Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>,
suffice it to reiterate that the same would finally dispose of defendant's
right to enforce his warranty against evic­tion, since a separate action for
the same, without having thus summoned to the suit the vendor, would not pros­per
(Art. <span style="">1558, </span>Civil Code, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After said disallow­ance, nothing further was
left to be done in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, as regards defendant's right
to enforce against <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> <span style="">the </span><span style="">warranty of </span><span style="">eviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said denial was there</span>fore
<span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is modified, so as to
allow the filing of the third-party complaint as against Pedro <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> but not against J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co. Case remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for further
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
