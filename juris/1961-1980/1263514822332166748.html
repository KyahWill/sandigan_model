 14, 1967</st1:date> elections for Lieutenant-Governor in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>sub-province</st1:placetype>

were petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estrello</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
and respondent Luis S. <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1967</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> went to the Com­mission on
Elections (<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He there petitioned to suspend canvass of the election returns from
Precinct 5, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dipaculao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, and Precincts 2, 7
and 15, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Maria
  Aurora</st1:placename></st1:place>, all of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>sub-province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Aurora</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sole ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is that alterations affecting the result of the election, were discovered to
have been fraudulently made on said election returns in the hands of the
provincial treasurer and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> sued for
time to enable him to seek a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised
Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, December 4, 1967, acting upon the foregoing
petition, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> wired respondent board of
canvassers, ordering the latter to suspend the canvass of votes cast for
Lieutenant-Governor in the aforementioned precincts and to suspend the proclamation
of any winning candidate for the said office for a period of five days from
December 4, to give respondent <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> time
"to go to court for [the] proper judicial remedy."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1967</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> lodged a petition in court
praying for a recount or, in the alternative, correction of the election
returns heretofore adverted to, and for preliminary in­junction.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
His petition reiterated the alleged alterations fraudulently made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He attached thereto copies of official
certifications of the munici­pal treasurers concerned and photocopies of the
returns on file with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December
 6, 1967</st1:date>, the court came out with an order directing judicial
recount and the issuance of a writ of prelim­inary injunction to stop respondent
board of canvassers from canvassing the returns in the questioned precincts and
from proclaiming the winning candidate for Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="20">8:30 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1967</st1:date>, the ballot boxes
for the three precincts of Maria Aurora were delivered to the court for
purposes of recount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deputy Clerk Andres
G. Cadiz, who took possession from the municipal treasurer thru the deputy
provincial sheriff, found them to have been tampered with, the bottoms thereof
having been destroyed and soldered bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1967</st1:date>,
candidate <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> asked the court to set aside said order
of judicial recount and to dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason he gave was that the official
certifications by the municipal treasurers, attached to the petition for
recount, were not the authentic copies contemplated by Section 163 of the
Revised Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He challenged the
court's jurisdiction to go into a recount of votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, at which both parties orally argued, the court, on
the same day, December 11, 1967, made the finding that "the requisites
mentioned in Section 163 of the Revised Election Code" were not
"complied with, as it is not alleged in petitioner's (herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>’] petition that another copy or other authentic
copies of the statements from the four (4) election precincts in question,
which allegedly give to petitioner [<span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>] a
different number of votes and the difference affects the results of the
election, have been submitted to respondent Provincial Board of Canvassers."
The court thereupon set aside its <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December
 6, 1967</st1:date> order directing the recount of votes cast in the disputed
precincts and, consequently, dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still on the same day, <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="12">December
 11, 1967</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, upon petition of
candidate <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>, wired another order directing
respondent board of canvassers to again suspend the canvass and proclamation
for forty-eight hours from receipt thereof, to enable <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>
to elevate to this Court the question of jurisdiction of the Court of First
Instance of Aurora on the matter in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This wire was received by the board on <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 13, 1967, instead of proceeding to this Court, <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> petitioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for
an order directing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the respondent board
of canvassers to immediately suspend canvass of votes in the four (4) precincts
in controversy and the proclamation of any winning candidate for
Lieutenant-Governor; (b) the municipal treasurers of <span class="SpellE">Dipaculao</span>
and Maria Aurora to immediately deliver to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
the election returns from Precinct 5 of <span class="SpellE">Dipaculao</span> and
Precincts 2, 7 and 15 of Maria Aurora; (c) the municipal treasurer of Maria
Aurora to immediately deliver to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> the ballot
boxes from Precincts 2, 7 and 15 of Maria Aurora, whose bottoms were allegedly
destroyed and contents tampered; (d) the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, as chairman of the provincial board of canvassers
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> and the Provincial Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, to immediately deliver to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
the allegedly falsified election returns from the four disputed precincts; (e)
a hearing before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> on the question of which
returns are genuine and correct, summoning for the purpose all the members of
the boards of inspectors concerned, who should be required to testify; and (f)
thereafter, the provincial board of canvassers to use the municipal treasurers’
copies of the election returns from the four questioned precincts in the
canvass of votes for Lieutenant-Governor of the sub-province of Aurora, and
then, make the corresponding proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The votes for the two candidates appearing on the copies of the
provincial treasurer and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, both allegedly
falsified, as compared with the votes in the purportedly genuine copies of the
municipal treasurers, are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">It is averred that in falsifying the copies for the provincial

erased and added by a different hand to produce the results reflected above.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> has, from the beginning,
consistently alleged that the vote difference in the discrepancies above shown
affects the true result of the election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his petition before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> dated <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1967</st1:date>, he specified that
as per the returns furnished him and the municipal treasurers of the
municipalities of <st1:city><st1:place>Aurora</st1:place></st1:city>
sub-province by the different boards of inspectors thereof, he (<span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>) received 8,554 votes while petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> garnered 8,424 votes, or a majority of 130 votes in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the falsifications charged are true, <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>
illegally lost a total of 310 votes while <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
illegally gained a total of 306 votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, upon the provincial treasurer's copies of the returns in the four
disputed precincts, <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> would lose to <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> by 486 votes; whereas, if the municipal treasurer's
copies were used for canvassing, <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> would win
over <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> by 130 votes, as heretofore stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court denied <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span> prayer for preliminary

to refrain from ordering respondent board of canvassers to canvass the votes
cast for Lieutenant-Governor in the disputed precincts and to refrain from
ordering the proclamation of the winning candidate for the said post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearings at the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>

<p class="BODY">On January 17, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, after
taking evidence and upon finding:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
that the copies of the election returns for the municipal treasurers of <span class="SpellE">Dipaculao</span> and Maria Aurora from the four precincts in
dispute are authentic, whereas the copies for the provincial treasurer of the
returns from the said precincts were falsified; and (b) that the three ballot
boxes for Precincts 2, 7 and 15 of Maria Aurora examined by the Commission
appeared to be patently tampered, the bottom of each box having been opened and
closed by soldering, promulgated its resolution, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering all the foregoing, the Commission finds, and RESOLVES

a returns of the Municipal Treasurer of the four Precincts are the true and
correct copies of the returns.</blockquote>

Prohibition and <i style="">Mandamus</i>, in view of
the preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court in said case already
mentioned earlier in this resolution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This case now stands submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The focal point is this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a case like the present, where copies of election returns were
alleged to have been tampered with and falsified after they have left the hands
of election inspectors, where should an aggrieved party seek his remedy, before
proclamation - the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> or the Court of First
Instance?</p>

<p class="BODY">The time has come, we believe, when we should take a hard look at
the limits of the authority of a court of first instance to take jurisdiction
under the provisions of Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> power over
election returns, A policy statement becomes necessary to avoid confusion.
There should be an expositor of the law for the guidance of all concerned.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence of this
Court thus far has established that the board of canvassers are to be guided by
election returns transmitted to it "which are in due form" and that
they must "be satisfied of the genuineness of the returns - namely, that
the papers presented to them are not forge and spurious" and "where
the returns are obviously manufactured, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the board will not be compelled to canvass them."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
And, if the board for one reason or another makes a wrong decision, or takes no
immediate action whether to consider or shunt aside returns which appear to
have been falsified or to be spurious, the matter may be elevated forthwith to
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span><i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></i>Because time, the fourth dimension, is of the essence; it cannot be
meaningless.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, as we recently declared in <span class="SpellE"><u>Espino</u></span>
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Zaldivar</u></span>, L-22325, <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1967</st1:date>, it is
"within the realm of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> concerns to
direct that only genuine returns be considered where x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> dastardly attempts were made to subvert the
people's choice by a resort to patently doctored returns."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
And this, because of the constitutional mandate that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
shall have exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws
relative to the conduct of elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

upon the other hand, circumscribes the power of a court of first instance to
direct a recounting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It says:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 163.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When</u> <u>statements</u>
<u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>precinct</u> <u>are</u> <u>contradictory</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In case it appears to the provincial board
of canvassers that another copy or other authentic copies of the statement from
an election precinct sub­mitted to the board give to a candidate a different
number of votes and the difference affects the result of the election, the
Court of First Instance of the province, upon motion of the board or of any
candidate affected, may proceed to recount the votes cast in the precinct for
the sole purpose of determining which is the true statement or which is the
true result of the count of the votes cast in said precinct for the office in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of such proceeding
shall be given to all candidates affected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have said in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lawsin</u></span> <u>vs</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Escalona</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
that a "judicial recount of votes under Section 163 - 'is a <u>special</u>
<u>authority</u> <u>conferred</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>Court</u> and must be
<u>restrictively</u> <u>construed</u>, so as not to extend to other cases that
may, more or less, bear some resemblance to the situation described in said
section (s).’” We there further pronounced:</p>

<blockquote>"The special nature and limited scope of the summary judicial
recount provided by section 168 of the Election Code is admittedly <u>aimed</u>
<u>at</u> <u>delaying</u> <u>as</u> <u>little</u> <u>as</u> <u>practicable</u> <u>the</u>
<u>proclamation</u> of the winning candidate, without prejudice to a thorough
revision of the election results in proper cases by means of the corresponding election
protest, which is the normal process provided for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>To</u> <u>multiply</u> <u>the</u> <u>grounds
</u>for a recount of votes before a proclamation by the board of canvassers is
made has the effect of downgrading the election protest as a remedy, and <u>to</u>
<u>prolong</u> <u>the</u> <u>periods</u> <u>during</u> <u>which</u> <u>the</u> <u>contested</u>
<u>positions</u> <u>will</u> <u>remain</u> <u>without</u> <u>an</u> <u>occupant</u>,
thereby provoking suspicion, conjecture, and unrest."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Viewed in this light, the court's delimited power in Section 163
of the Revised Election Code may only be invoked where "it appears to the
provincial board of canvassers that <u>another</u> <u>copy</u> or other <u>authentic</u>
copies of the statement from an election precinct submitted to the board give
to a candidate a different number of votes and the difference affects the
result of the election." To be underscored is the concept of the term
"another copy or other authentic copies." We pointed out in <span class="SpellE"><u>Espino</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Zaldivar</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>, that -</p>

<blockquote>"Implicit in the statute just quoted [Section 163] is that
differences in the number of votes given a candi­date should result from <u>contradiction</u>
in the <u>different</u> returns, as prepared and signed by the inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not discern in the law a purpose to
throw the burden on courts where it is patent - as is the case here - that
tampering a the returns occurred <u>after</u> they have left the hands of the
election inspectors, just to pave the way for the proclamation of a candi­date
in whose favor falsification was resorted to."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appropriately to be drawn
then is the line that divides the powers of the boards of canvassers and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, on the one hand, and the Court of First Instance,
on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are unprepared to say
that the election law intended that where, in a given precinct, some of the
returns are authentic and others are falsified, both the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
and the Court of First Instance will have concurrent jurisdiction - prior to
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such procedure breeds
confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It detracts so much from the
powers granted the boards of canvassers and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to proceed with dispatch with the work of canvassing and proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where before or during canvassing or before proclamation
representations are made that returns are falsified, it becomes the primary
duty, first of the board of canvassers, and then of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
to ascertain this fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">If finally the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> summarily finds
that there was falsification of the copies to be used for canvassing purposes,
then canvassing must be made upon the basis of authentic copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because a falsified return or spurious return
amounts to no return at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, on the other hand, the discrepancy in the returns was the
result of honest mistakes of the board of inspectors, two courses of action are
open in the court of first instance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
a petition for correction of returns with the consent of all the members of the
board of inspectors under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code;<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) a petition by the said board or any candidate affected for summary
judicial recount under Sections 163 and 168 of the same code.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the three remedies heretofore marked out are intended to be
speedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resort to the board of
canvassers and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in cases of falsification
should give rise to expeditious proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unanimity of the board of inspectors paves the way for immediate
correction by court order of any mistakes in the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So also is judicial recount - on application
of any candidate affected - summary in nature; Worth remembering at this point
is <span class="SpellE"><u>Cawa</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Del</u> <u>Rosario</u>,
L-16837-40, <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1960</st1:date>,
where we ruled that a summary judicial recount is merely for the purpose of
counting the number of votes received by each candidate "<u>as</u> <u>they</u>
<u>appear</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>face</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>ballots</u>."
After all, ballot appreciation is proper in an election contest <u>after</u>
proclamation.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedies thus
delineated are explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They serve as guidelines.
The right course to pursue given the fact of discrepancy -by reason of mistake
or otherwise - is there.</p>

<p class="BODY">We concede that there could be some delay in proclamation where
the wrong step is taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mistakes are
bound to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lack of the required
data compounded with pressure of time conceivably may induce an incorrect
move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to be accentuated is the
cornerstone tenet in elections of public officers that the choice of the people
expressed at the polls should not be frustrated by wrongful acts which can be
remedied. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And amongst these is
falsification of returns resorted to by the unscrupulous. It is correct to say
that these acts are punishable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not as easy, however, to pinpoint guilt <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emboldened, malefactors falsify returns in the
hope that the board of canvassers may take them for the genuine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A defeated candidate may grab proclamation,
take his seat, while he keeps the victim out by a long drawn expensive election
protest - if protest the latter can afford. It is because of all these that
remedies before proclamation, within the limits set out by the law, must have
to be exhausted. Important is that a canvass and proclamation be made on the
basis of authentic returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The end to
be achieved more than compensates the effort, money, and time expended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remedies heretofore mentioned before proclamation, likewise
offer a practical solution. Each of them far outweighs, in beneficent effects,
a subsequent election protest as a mode of relief. <u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because they take away the inducement -
proclamation - to falsify the genuine returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prompt
confirmation of the expression of the people's will - the overriding
consideration - is effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between the short delay in proclamation and
the long delay in an election protest, the choice is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is preferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It brings results more consonant with
fairness and reason.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other argument
pressed upon us is that, by the series of steps which <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>
had previously taken he is barred from filing his last petition before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> praying, amongst others, for a ruling on the
falsification of returns charge These steps, petitioner points out, are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>
asked the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to suspend canvass and proclamation
for Lieutenant-Governor to enable him to file a petition for judicial recount,
which <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did; second, <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>
then filed his petition for judicial recount in the Court of First Instance of
the sub-province of Aurora, which was dismissed after hearing; and third, <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> again asked <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to
suspend canvass and proclamation for a period of forty-eight hours so that he
can elevate the question of jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of
Aurora to the Supreme Court, which <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But instead, respondent <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span> returned to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and
procured <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> order of December 13 now under
review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The wrong proceedings taken by <span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>
in this case cannot constitute <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, that is reduced to a technicality which
serves no purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Etcubañez</span>
has not adopted inconsistent positions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Right from the start, his assertion - which never changed - was that the
election returns to be canvassed from the four precincts concerned, were
fraudulently altered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No positive
assertion of facts has been made from which he retreats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No party was misled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No fraud was foisted on anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, the crux of the matter is in his
honest misconception of the recourse furnished him by the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, no <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> can attach. The authorities are clear on this
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In broad terms, an act or
representation made <u>through</u> <u>innocent</u> <u>mistake</u> or <u>misapprehension</u>
or induced by fraud is not a ground for <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
More particularly, the assertion of a legal conclusion <u>where</u> <u>the</u> <u>facts</u>
<u>are</u> <u>all</u> <u>stated</u> does not operate to <span class="SpellE">estop</span>
the person making the assertion.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
And this, because, as we have already confirmed, the rule on <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> applies to questions of fact, not of law, about
the truth of which the other party is ignorant.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
We can derive, great profit from the statement that an "expression of
opinion as to what the law is does not make the law other than it is, nor does
it <span class="SpellE">estop</span> a party from relying on the law as it really
is."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And then, respondent's moves in swift succession constitute proof
of diligence in the protection of his rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He cannot be accused of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The overriding consideration, of course, is that, above and
beyond the narrow personal stakes of the opposing candidates, the rights of the
electorate, not to say the people, are involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To these rights we pay full respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus that the view is here expressed
that <u>before</u> proclamation <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> hands
should not be unduly shackled from deciding election matters the purpose of
which is to ascertain the will of the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should be given the opportunity in the
first instance to try within its capabilities to approximate the people's will
and thereby forestall the imminent probability that a wrong man may discharge a
public trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should write off an
unreasonable bridle upon <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> constitutionally
ordained obligation of exclusively enforcing and administering the election
laws and of insuring free, orderly, and honest elections, And this, if only to
help stem the tide of illegal election practices, commission of electoral
crimes, coercion of election officials, Abhorrence of the iniquity and
injustice resulting from a public office being occupied by a candidate
undeservingly proclaimed, is sufficient justification for our view that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is not powerless to fashion the appropriate remedy
- prevent the use in canvass of falsified returns.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, we are asked to
reexamine the doctrine laid down in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Espino</u></span>
case, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No compelling reason
exists why we should break away <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>. It is
argued that in pronouncing that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has power to
direct rejection of patently doctored returns, we tend to less heavily on <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, which unlike a court of justice, does not observe
procedural safeguards other than the bare requirement of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this merely emphasizes the fact that the
proceeding to determine which returns are genuine is summary; its purpose, to
expedite canvassing and proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
be stressed here is that really judicial recourse before proclamation may only
be had in the limited cases provided by law, i.e., petition for correction and
petition for recount.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other drawbacks there are which deter us from giving the nod to
the view that courts should be made to decide <u>before</u> <u>proclamation</u>
whether returns are falsified or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily summary in nature, the proceeding does not partake of a
full-dress trial. Probability exists that the court's finding in such summary
inquiry may, for lack of time, be wanting in the desirable earmarks of
contemplative wisdom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it may be
conducive to an arbitrary prejudgment of the factual issue of
falsification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the very same court
later on may be called upon to go over the question in a criminal case for
falsification or in an election contest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What if it draws a different conclusion? An embarrassing conflict of
views by the same court, perhaps by the same judge, is not a remote
possibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">And if all the procedural safeguards attendant in regular court
proceedings to determine falsification as a fact, are to be observed, undue
delay in proclamation is not far from a certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proclamation cannot wait for so long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elected officials, by law, should sit at
dates not far removed from election day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yet, there is a necessity, to strike down falsified returns before
they even begin to inflict damage.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, the victim of a proclamation upon falsified returns may
still go to court in an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But adverted to elsewhere this opinion is the fact that election
protests take a long time to decide If the protestant turns out to be the
actual winner in the elections, irreparable injury shall have been done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A grave injustice is caused to the winner, a
great wrong to the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worth reading
once again is the language of this Court, speaking thru Mr. Chief Justice Cesar
<span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Climaco</u></span>, L-25444, January 31, 1966.
It reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The well-known delay in the adjudication of election protests
often gave the successful contestant <u>a</u> <u>mere</u> <u>pyrrhic</u> <u>victory</u>,
i.e., a vindication when the term office is, about to expire, or has
expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so the notion has spread among
candidates for public office that the 'important thing' is the proclamation;
and to win it, they or their partisans have <u>tolerated</u> <u>or</u> <u>abetted</u>
<u>the</u> <u>tampering</u> <u>or</u> <u>the</u> <u>'manufacture'</u> <u>of</u>

to work for an empty triumph.</blockquote>

pressed upon us in a more clear-cut manner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And without, in any way, modifying our stand as outlined in the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party vs. Commission decision, we feel the
mores of the day require application - even extension - of the principle in the
Mitchell decision, which is realistic and commonsensical even, as it strikes a
blow at such pernicious '<u>grab</u>-<u>the</u>-<u>proclamation</u>-<u>prolong</u>-<u>the</u>-<u>protest</u>’

<p class="BODY">Our view, therefore, is that, in confirmation of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Espino</u></span> doctrine, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>

use genuine election returns for canvassing purposes.</p>
