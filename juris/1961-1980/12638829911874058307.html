conformity with this Court's judgment in De Laureano vs. Adil, L-43345, July
29, 1976, 72 SCRA 148.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the said comment, the petitioner filed a reply dated September

"with prejudice, the parties having entered into a Compromise Agreement
with respect thereto".</p>

in the lower lefthand corner thereof, where, below the handwritten words
"no objection", the signature of her counsel appears.</p>
