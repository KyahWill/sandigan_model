				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Government seeks a review of the decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
petitioner and against the respond­ents, declaring that respondent <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Parina</span> is not entitled to
the position of Customs Examiner I-R-23 in the Appraiser's Division of the
Bureau of Customs and that petitioner Juan E. <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>
is the person legally entitled to hold and exercise the same, and ordering the
Personnel Officer of the Bureau of Customs, Acting Commissioner of Civil
Service, Acting Commissioner of Customs and Acting Secretary of Finance to
restore said petitioner immediately to that position with a salary <span style="">corresponding to the position next lower </span>in
rank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without special
pronouncement as to costs."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner Juan E. <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> was, on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February 15, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="">, appointed clerk in the Bureau of
Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="1"><span style="">January 1, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, he received a permanent appointment as
Customs Liquidator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Promoted, on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="11"><span style="">November
 1, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, to the
position of </span>Customs <span style="">Examiner I,
Item No. 123-16, page 246, of Republic Ac</span>t <span style="">No. 1600, he was subsequently extended promotional appointments in
salary, the last of which was for P2<span class="GramE">,808.00</span> per
annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1960, an
administrative charge, Case No. R-21540, was filed against him, for alleged
grave misconduct, upon </span>the <span style="">ground
that a carton and a pack of untaxed Chesterfield cigarettes, <span style="">three (3) packs </span>of untaxed Camel
cigarettes and two (2) </span>cakes <span style="">of
face soap were found in his possession, as he sought to take them with him from
the Manila Air Station, after examining </span>the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">baggages</span></span><span style=""> of passenge</span>rs <span style="">who had
arrived from Guam on board the transport "SS DAVID SHUNK." After
appropriate proceedings, the Civil Service Commission rendered a decision, </span>dated
<st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November
 9, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, finding him
guilty as charged and suspending him for six (6) months, without pay, and
reprimanding him, as well as giving him a warning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision was, on appeal to the Civil
Service B</span>oard <span style="">of Appeals,
affirmed by the latter, <span style="">except </span>as
to the penalty, with respect to which the Board had decreed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"his salary is hereby reduced to that <span style="">corresponding to the position next lower in
rank, in lieu of </span>the six (6) months suspension imposed by the
Commissioner of </span>Civil <span style="">Service,"
apart <span style="">from </span>the afore mentioned
reprimand and warning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration
sought by <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> was denied by </span>said Board, on
<st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="9"><span style="">September
 26, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, or on
December 2, 1963, the then Secre­tary of Finance, upon the recommendation of
the Acting Com­missioner of </span>Customs, <span style="">and with the approval of the then Acting Deputy Commissioner of Civil
Service, appointed <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> as Clerk II, R-25, at
P2,196.00 per annum — which, admittedly, is the salary corresponding to the
position next </span>lower <span style="">in rank to
that held by him - effective upon assumption of duty, and </span>promoted <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Parina</span> — who had,
theretofore, held said position of Clerk II at P2,196.00 per annum -- to <span class="SpellE">Sevilla's</span> position as Customs Examiner I, R-32, with a
salary of P2,808.00 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> instituted, in the Court of
First Instance of Manila, the present <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span><u>
</u>proceedings against <span class="SpellE">Parina</span>, The Acting Secretary
of Finance, the Acting Commissioner of Customs, the Personnel Officer of the
Bureau of Customs and the Acting Commissioner of Civil Service; to oust <span class="SpellE">Parina</span> from said office of <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>
and secure the latter's reinstatement thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In due course, said court rendered the aforementioned decision, from
which the Government has appealed directly to the Supreme Court, on questions
purely of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue in this appeal, as in the lower court, boils down to
whether or not the decision of the Civil Service Board of Appeals, sentencing <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> to a reduction of his salary 'to that corresponding
to the position next lower in rank," meant to divest him of his position
as Customs Examiner I — with an item and an annual compensation of P2,808.00 —
and to require that he be given another position, with the reduced salary
aforementioned, or merely reduced his salary to that corresponding to the
position next lower in rank, <u>without</u> a change of item and/or position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government maintains that the first alternative was intended
by the Civil Service Board of Appeals, although the latter did not say so
specifically, because "it would be absurd to consider that a single
position can be lower in rank to itself," and because <span class="SpellE">Sevilla's</span>
salary can not be reduced "without the accompanying appointment to the
position to which the reduced salary corresponds."</p>

<p class="BODY">We are unable to share this view.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, the decision of the Board did not direct that <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> be given a <span style="">"<u>position</u>"
</span>other than that he was holding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It merely ordain­ed that his "<u>salary</u>" - not position —
be "reduced to that" — <span style="">meaning
</span><u>salary</u> --- "corresponding to the position next lower in
rank." Indeed, a person may hold an office or position at a salary lower
than the amount of the budgetary item <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, which
is but the maximum he can be given, under said item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, despite <span class="SpellE">Sevilla's</span>
appointment — immediately preceding the contested one — for an item and
position carrying a compensation of P2,808.00 per annum, it is not contested
that the Board could have rendered <span style="">a
valid decision either <u>suspending</u> his right to discharge the duties of
said position and to collect the emoluments attached thereto, or <u>divesting
him completely</u> of said position and of the aforesaid emoluments, by
decreeing his removal from office or dismissal from the service, without any
further action on the part of the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the Board has the <u>lesser</u>
power to reduce said emoluments, without such <span style="">action on </span>the part of the appointment authority, or without
requiring another appointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Otherwise, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the decision of the Board, even if valid and
final, as well as <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, would be depend­ent upon
the willingness of the appointing authority to imple­ment it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the power of appointment
necessarily entails the exercise of judgment and discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the officer clothed with such power
cannot be compelled to exercise it in favor of a given person.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As a consequence, the theory of the
Government in this case tends, either to im­pair the efficacy of decisions of
the Civil Service Board of Appeals, or to undermine the basic assumptions of
the power of appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We do</span></span> <span style="">not believe that either alternative is consistent with the letter and
spirit of our laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed,
without special pronouncement as <span style="">to cost</span>s.</p>

"Congress can not, either appoint the Commissioner <span style="">of </span>the National Employment Service, or impose upon the President
at the duty to appoint any particular person to said office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The a pointing power is the exclusive
prerogative of the President, upon which no limitations may be imposed by
Congress, except those resulting from the need of securing the concurrence of
the Commission on Appointments and from the exercise of the limited legislative
power to prescribe the qualifications to a given appointive office." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Quitoriano</span>,
L-6898, April 30, 1954.)</span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: -27pt;">"Appointment of a public
officer involves the exercise of discretion which, unless abused, the courts
will not attempt to control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
that power, in no just sense can it be said that the right exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the appointing officer or body may
listen to the recommendation or advice of others, yet the selection must
finally be his or its act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so this
power of selection of an appointee is and should be vested alone in the
officers of boards authorized to appoint, although it is limited to persons
possessing the qualifications required by the civil service statues and
rules." (42 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 951)</p>
