				<BR><BR><div align=""><o:smarttagtype name="date" namespaceuri="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"></o:smarttagtype><div class="Section1"><br><p>This direct appeal was interposed by Flora <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> 
against an order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo (in its Civil Case No. 
1138), dated June 26, 1962, requiring her to restore to <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Salas the products of a parcel of land that had 
been delivered to her pending appeal against a judgment of the same court in 
favor of <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> but which was later reversed by final 
judgment of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. 10288-R. The reversal was 
subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court in case G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-14961.</span></p>
<p><span class="GramE">Originally, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">Salas,</span> had filed 
in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo an action against Flora <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span>, in the latter's capacity as <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Datoon</span>. The complaint 
averred plaintiff's ownership of a parcel of land (Lot 7711 of the <span class="SpellE">Pototan</span> Cadastre), covered by T.C.T. No. 11841, allegedly 
mortgaged by Salas to the late <span class="SpellE">Datoon</span> (in the form of 
a sale a retro) in order to secure n debt to the latter, and sought <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> thereof upon payment of the P100.00 balance of 
the indebtedness, which plaintiff consigned in court. Defendant pleaded in 
answer that Salas had conveyed title to <span class="SpellE">Datoon</span>; that 
the latter had been in possession of the land since 1934, as owner, thereof; and 
that plaintiff's possession was that of a mere tenant of defendant <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>. The latter also counterclaimed for the 
landlord's share of the produce of the lot, at the rate of 20 <span class="SpellE">bultos</span> worth P500.00 per annum. At defendant's instance a 
receiver was appointed by the court.</p>
<p>After trial, the Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, and ordered 
the plaintiff and/or the receiver to deliver possession to the defendant <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span>. It also sentenced <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> 
Salas to pay damages at the rate of P400.00 per agricultural year until that of 
1948-1949; P300.00 for the ensuing, year 1949-1950; and P240.00 for the year 
after that. Salas appealed the judgment, but upon motion the defendant <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span>, in 1951, obtained execution pending appeal (Rec. 
App., p. 45), and the land was turned over to her.</p>
<p>In 1958, the Court of Appeals, as noted at the start of this opinion, 
reversed the judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">lloilo</span>, and ordered Flora <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> 
to execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the disputed lot 
to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Salas, upon withdrawal of the 
P100 previously consigned in court by the latter; and declared that—</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"<span class="GramE">immediately</span> after the execution of said deed, it is 
the duty of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and/or receiver to turn over 
the material possession of the lot in question to the plaintiff appellant, to 
whom shall also be delivered all the funds which the receiver may have in his 
hands less his compensation."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> resorted to the Supreme Court, but in 1961 
the latter affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The decision became 
final, and the records were remanded to the court of origin. The corresponding 
writ of execution having been issued at the behest of Salas, the Sheriff 
delivered possession of the lot to the prevailing Party; and after various 
incidents and pleadings Flora <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> finally executed 
the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, as ordered, in favor of 
Salas on <st1:date month="3" day="24" year="1962">March 24, 1962</st1:date>. 
However, <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> resisted the order to turn over the 
products of the land, claiming that the decision of the Court of <span class="SpellE">Appals</span> had made no mention thereof. The Court of First 
Instance, on <st1:date month="6" day="26" year="1962">June 26, 1962</st1:date>, 
overruled her objections, and on <st1:date month="7" day="17" year="1962">July 
17, 1962</st1:date> denied her motion to reconsider. Thereupon, Flora <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> appealed once more to the Supreme Court, reiterating 
her arguments in the court below.</p>
<p>We find no merit in the appeal.</p>
<p>The appellant <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> having obtained in 1951 a writ 
of execution pending appeal, and thus taken possession of the land in dispute, 
she thereby replaced the receiver for all legal purposes in the collection of 
its produce. In equity and justice, therefore, the decree of the Court of 
Appeals to deliver to the winning party (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> Salas) the material possession of the land as 
well as "all the funds which the receiver may have in his hands" applies to her 
(<span class="SpellE">Quinga</span>) as well, as if she were the receiver 
proper.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals had no need of specifying in the judgment of reversal 
that there should be restitution of the land and of its products. Such 
restoration is expressly provided for in Rule 39, section 5, of the Rules of 
Court:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"Sec. 5.</span> Effect of reversal of executed 
judgment.—<span class="GramE">Where</span> the judgment executed is reversed 
totally or partially on appeal, the trial court, on motion, after the case is 
remanded to it, may issue such orders of restitution as equity and justice may 
warrant under the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="GramE">and</span> the rule should apply in the absence of any 
contrary disposition in the final judgment of the appellate courts. </p>
<p>Under the aforesaid judgment, appellant <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> 
should have <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> the land to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Salas as soon as the latter tendered the balance of 
the indebtedness. Had <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> done so, Salas would have 
remained in possession; she would not have been turned out in 1951, is she was, 
by the premature execution; and she would have received the crops of the land 
thereafter. It is but just, therefore, that <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span> 
should be required to account for the products that she was able to receive in 
the place of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Salas.</p>
<p>It is no <span class="GramE">defense</span> that, prior to the finality of the 
judgment of the appellate court, the land and its products had been already 
distributed among the heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Datoon</span>. His <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, 
appellant herein, personally knew of the claim of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Salas; she also knew, and was bound to know, that 
the judgment of the Court of First Instance dismissing the complaint had been 
appealed, and could be reversed. It was, therefore, incumbent upon her to 
reserve the land and its products from distribution among the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Datoon</span> until final judgment was rendered, and she is 
personally answerable for her failure to do so, apart from the obligation of the 
heirs themselves not to profit from what is not theirs.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders appealed from are affirmed, and the records 
ordered remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings consonant with 
this decision. <span class="GramE">Costs against appellant Flora <span class="SpellE">Quinga</span>.</span></p>
