and prohibition with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction, filed by the petitioners - City Auditor, City Treasurer and
Assistant City Treasurer of the City of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> -
against the respondent Judge Mariano A. <span class="SpellE">Zo­sa</span> of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental,
imputing lack and/or excess of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion to
said respondent in the use against petitioners of His Honor's power to punish
for contempt and seeking to prohibit the respondent judge from proceed­ing with
the hearing of the contempt proceedings against said petitioners in the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following background facts may be gleaned from the pleadings
of the parties: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Under Resolution No. 72,
dated January 22, 1965, of the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span>,
respondent - presiding judge of Branch III (at <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>)
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental
-was granted gasoline allowance at the rate of P100.00 per month for the period
from August 1, 1964 to June 30, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The resolution was duly approved by the Mayor of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Availing of the privilege granted, respondent
sought to collect the gasoline allowance aforesaid by presenting the
corresponding vouchers - one for the sum of P1,100.00 covering the period from
August, 1964 to June, 1965, and the other for the amount of P600.00 covering
the period from July to December, 1965 - to the petitioners City Treasurer and
the City Auditor of Ozamiz City for audit and payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one for P600.00 was presented on a date
not disclosed in the record but evidently earlier than March 2, 1966 be­cause
it was on this latter date that, according to the pleadings, the same voucher
was presented again together, this time, with the one for P1,100.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
According to the respondent, he was accompanied by councilor <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abasolo</span>, Jr. on the
first occasion and the second voucher was presented not by him personally but
by a certain Judge <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Largo and an Atty. Francisco
<span class="SpellE">Alfajardo</span>, nei­ther of whom is shown to have any
connection with the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assistant
City Treasurer Hugo B. <span class="SpellE">Daguman</span>, in his capacity as
Acting City Treasurer at the time, refused to pay the said vouchers, the said
official pointing out that the same were not accompanied with the requisite ap­proval
by the Department of Justice of the said grant to respondent of the privilege
to enjoy the gasoline allow­ance referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">To obviate the Acting City Treasurer's objection to the claim,
respondent worked for the approval of the Re­solution granting the gasoline
allowance by the Office of the President, thru the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meanwhile, he requested the Assistant
City Treasurer in a letter dated June 2, 1965 to obligate the corresponding
accumulated funds for his gasoline allowance in the books of account of the city
to forestall their impending re­version to the general fund, since, at the
time, the fis­cal year was about to end.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That request was not given any favorable response by the Assistant City
Treasurer who justified his action by claiming that at that time, he was not
even certain that there would be enough bal­ances and no overdraft would be
incurred by the city at the end of that fiscal year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1966</st1:date>,
respondent presented again his vouchers to the officials of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:place></st1:city> concern­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said vouchers were then duly accompanied
already with the required approval of the Executive Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to respondent, his representatives
who made the follow-up of his claim with the office of the City Audi­tor were
assured by the said official then that he would pass the vouchers in audit as
they were duly supported with the necessary papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out later, however, that in his
letter to the City Treasurer dated March 2, 1966, petitioner City Auditor
advised the former that his office offered no objection to the giving of
gasoline allowance to Judge Mariano A. <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span> of Branch
III of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental with station at <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, same province, <u>only for the period by his
tour and for actual services rendered in this jurisdiction as vacation judge or
as may be so ordered by the Honorable Secretary of Justice</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That letter was transmitted by mail, together
with an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to the respondent. It was
received at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1966</st1:date>
by respondent who, at the time of the delivery, was in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
presiding over the hearing of Criminal Case No. 5918.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He read it then and there, after which he
showed signs of emotional disturbance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Distressed by what to him appeared to be "a sudden and unexpected
turnabout" in the stand of petitioner City Auditor in the merit of his
claim for gasoline allowance, and construing the collective actions taken by
all the petitioners "a concerted design and plan" of said officials
"to humi­liate, ridicule and downgrade him and his office" to satisfy
their desire to "make him appear as a mendicant", respondent
immediately suspended and cancelled the hearing of the case before him and
issued an order to the three city officials for them to appear before him for
contempt at 8:00 o'clock in the morning of the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It developed that the subpoena (by telegram)
issued for the purpose was not served to petitioner Assistant City Treasurer
Hugo B. <span class="SpellE">Daguman</span> and when only petitioners City
Auditor <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Buyco</span>
and City Treasurer <span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Kabanlit</span>
appeared before respondent in the morning of March 8, 1966, the hearing of the
contempt charge against them was postponed to the afternoon of that day in
order to secure the appearance of petitioner City Auditor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing on the contempt charge was
accordingly held at <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30</st1:time> in the
afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor explained to the
three city officials the background of his contempt charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before he was through explaining his
position, other incidents marred the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point, the <st1:place><st1:placename>peti­tioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Auditor must have been either
amused or taunted by the way the respondent judge called out his name "<span class="SpellE">Buyco</span>", and when he stood up in response, respondent
ordered his arrest on the ground that the City Auditor was sneering or laughing
at the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an officer of the court
was conducting him to jail in pursuance of the respondent judge's order, respondent
called back said petitioner and asked him:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Are you laughing?" The latter answered, "No, sir."
Respondent repeated the question and the City Auditor reiterated his
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must have all the more
intensely vexed respondent because according to him it was "not only
without respect but defiant to the authority and dignity of the court in
session", so he declared <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Auditor guilty of contempt and
ordered him incarcerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only after the
said city official had stayed in jail for about five (5) minutes did respondent
reconsider his order of incarceration and had the said petitioner brought back
before the court from jail; and only then was respondent judge able to
continue, explaining his position in his contempt charge against the three city
officials in connection with their previous actions relative to his claim for
gasoline allowance, which charge has been docketed in his court as Special Case
No. 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the respondent judge
filed with the court the written specification of his charges, to wit:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"SPECIFICATION OF
CHARGES<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, without asking for it on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1965</st1:date>, the Municipal Board of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City adopted and passed Resolution No. 72 which
resolution is well known to respondents;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, wishing to avail of the privilege magnanimously
granted by the said Resolution, the Presiding Judge of Branch III of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, trusted
employee sent for pre-audit and payment by the City Auditor and <span class="SpellE">and</span> the City Treasurer a voucher for the payment of the
gasoline allowance from August 1, 1964;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, without much ado and with the least respect to the
Presiding Judge, then Acting City Treasurer Hugo <span class="SpellE">Daguman</span>
refused payment, and when asked for a written comment regarding his refusal despite
repeated requests made by the offended Judge, refused to make his rejection in
writing;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, in order to forestall reversion of the accumulated
amount due the offended Judge, a letter was written and sent to then Acting
Treasurer <span class="SpellE">Daguman</span> duly receipted by his Office on
June 2, 1965 requesting him to have the amount due obligated in the books of
account of the City pending receipt of approval by the Executive Department and
motivated by hatred and spite did not so obligate as requested;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, in a letter dated March 2, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Buyco</span>, in connivance and confabulating with the
City Treasurer and the Assistant City Treasurer of the City of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span>, to put in public contempt and ridicule the
Presiding Judge of Branch III of this Court, wrote a letter which the
respondents well know, in connection with Resolution No. 72 (was) duly approved
by the Office of the President, limiting the enjoyment of such allowance 'only
during the period covered by his tour of duty and actual services rendered in <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City as vacation Judge or as may be so ordered by
the Honorable Secretary of Justice', as aforesaid contrary to what was granted
by Resolution No. 72 and duly approved by the Executive Department purposely to
belittle, begrudge and ridicule and expose to public contempt the offended
Judge;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This unprovoked act of the respondents has so humiliated,
embarrassed and ridiculed the Court causing emotional stress and untold shame
on the Presiding Judge so much so that in the trial of Criminal Case No, 5918,
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span>
the time the letter of the City Auditor indorsed through the City Treasurer was
received, the offended Judge had to suspend and cancel all proceedings as he
was so mentally disturbed by the letter of the respondents amounting to grave
and actual disturbance of Court proceedings which act constituted as it did
constitute not only direct but also constructive contempt of court as it had
severely impaired the administration of justice, and has subjected the Court to
public contempt and ridicule.</blockquote>

by <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>

praying for an extension of five (5) days from March 12, within which to file
their respective answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same

was required to answer said petition and restrained from proceeding to conduct

</span>It turned out later, however, that in the meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1966</st1:date>, hearing on the contempt

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Auditor and Assistant City
Treasurer were arrested and lodged in the provincial jail at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> that same morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a Saturday and the respondent judge
had gone home before counsel for the two incarcerated officials was able to
file an urgent motion for reconsideration praying the court to reconsider its
order of detention or, in the alternative, to fix the bond for their provisional
liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was already <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon when the
respondent signed the order for their release upon their filing a cash bond of
P500.00 each.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the position of petitioners that the respondent judge's
vouchers for gasoline allowance, like any ordinary money claim of private
persons against the City of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span>, are subject to
auditing rules and procedures; that as he disallowance or denial thereof in
audit by them (petitioners) should neither constitute violation of an order of
His Honor nor expose him to ridicule and public contempt; and, that the act of
respondent judge in requiring them to appear before him in order to face the
contempt charge <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>, even if their denial of
the vouchers in question is supported by well-grounded reasons and auditing
rules and regulations, constitutes grave abuse of discretion and excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners charge that
respondent judge was using the power of his court to punish for contempt as a
coercive measure to compel them to pass in audit his claim for gasoline
allowance.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent judge, on the other hand, denies such imputation and counters that
he filed the contempt charge against the herein petitioners not to secure the
allowance of his vouchers as he had long waived his right to the gasoline
allowance claimed therein, but, that the real basis of his contempt charge
against them is the shabby, disrespectful, unmitigated harassment and ridicule
and exposure to public contempt he was subjected to by petitioners who made him
go back and forth to <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City looking like a
beggar and a mendicant when his above-mentioned vouchers were presented to them
for audit and payment, which, according to him, constitute both direct and
constructive contempt of court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Viewed from any angle, the circumstances of this case cannot
justify the actuations of respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Quite the contrary, what appears evident here is that much of the
unpleasantness which attended the incidents before Us now could have been
avoided if respondent judge had only acted with the sobriety and circumspection
expected of him as a judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
obvious that the matter he had taken up with petitioners - the processing of
the vouch­ers for his gasoline allowances - was not, in legal con­templation,
officially connected with the administration of justice or the functions of his
office and so, peti­tioners were not under strict obligation to render him, in
relation thereto, the same degree of obeisance and sub­mission as are due to a
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If some measure of defer­ence
were lacking in their attitude, there was not enough ground for him to invoke
his power to punish for contempt, specially because petitioner city auditor's
objection to the approval of respondent's vouchers to the effect that there was
no indication in said vouchers that respondent had used his car "in a tour
of duty in the City of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span>" or that he-had
rendered any service in the said outside his territorial jurisdiction this
defined the pertinent administrative order of the Department of Justice cannot
be said to be altogether whimsical or capricious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is highly important for judges to bear in
mind at all times that the power of contempt, being drastic and extraordinary
in its nature, should not be resorted to unless it is necessary to do so in the
interest of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
We do not see that respondent judge was so motivated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judges of the courts of first instance are national officials
whose compensations are paid wholly by the national government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent has not cited any law and none has
been found by Us which makes it the obligation of local governments to pay them
any additional compensation, remu­neration or allowance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By respondent's own assertion, the allowances
which gave rise to the incidents herein involved were in the nature of a
"privilege magnanimously granted" by the Municipal Board of <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
this Court is aware that respondent has not been the only recipient of such
kind of generosity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similar grants of
transportation and gasoline allowances are reported to be a general practice in
many, if not all, of the provinces and cities throughout the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More, even grants for travel abroad, styled
as study or inspection tours, involving scores of thousands of pesos have been
reportedly accepted and enjoyed by some judges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No less than the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has taken cognizance of such practices and of their undesirable
implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apprehensive of their
adverse effects on the integrity and independence of the judiciary and the
faith of the people in its complete impartiality, the President has pointed out
in Memorandum Circular No. 191 dated <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1968</st1:date>:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"MEMORANDUM
CIRCULAR NO. 191<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"PRESCRIBING
THE POLICY REGARDING THE GRANT OF TRANSPORTATION AND REPRESENTATION ALLOWANCES,
INCLUDING OTHERS OF SIMILAR NATURE, PAYABLE OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDS, TO
JUDGES OF THE COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE AND COURTS OF EQUIVALENT RANK AND JUDGES
OF CITY AND MUNI­CIPAL COURTS, AND OTHER NATIONAL OFFICIALS BELONGING TO THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Executive Order No. 31, s. 1954, as pointed out by the Auditor
General, authorizes the payment of transportation allowance, for the use on
official business of privately-owned automobiles, only to <u>provincial</u> and
<u>city</u>, officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recently,
however, it has become the practice of some lo­cal governments to grant not
only transportation allowances but representation and other allowances, at
rates entirely at their discretion, to judges and other national government officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strictly speaking, these allowances should be
provided by the national government and not by the local governments, since the
administration of justice is a matter of national, not local, concern.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Aside from the lack of uniformity in the rates of these
allowances, it bears emphasis that since these are granted in the discretion of
the local legislative bodies and executive officials, who may from time to time
substantially increase or decrease or entirely with­draw the same at their
pleasure, the practice would tend to undermine the people's faith in the
impartial administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While undoubtedly most of the recipients of these allowances would
remain true to their oath of office in the discharge of their duties, the
receipt of such allowances would nevertheless give cause for litigants to doubt
their impar­tiality especially where local officials who have some say on these
allowances appear as counsel for, or appear to be interceding on behalf of, the
adverse parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to add, the
independence of the judiciary, which is so vital to the stability of our
democratic institutions, should not be placed under such a cloud of suspicion,
even if unfounded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To establish uniform rates of transpor­tation allowances for
judges and said offi­cials, it is hereby declared the policy of the Office of
the President to authorize, as it is hereby authorized, the payment of trans­portation
allowances to judges of the courts of first instance, and those of courts of
equivalent rank who are not receiving any such allowance from the national
government, at a monthly rate not exceeding P200.00; to judges of the city
courts of Manila and <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, at the same rate;
to other city judges and national government officials belonging to the
Department of Justice, at a monthly rate not exceeding P150.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Henceforth, no representation or any other form of allowance,
including the so-called travel grant, shall be authorized to be paid out of, or
chargeable against, any local government funds appropriated for the said
purpose in favor of any of the above-mentioned judges or officials.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Secretary of Justice and the Audi­tor General are hereby
directed to implement immediately this circular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To insure strict compliance with the policy
herein establish­ed, and to guard against unauthorized pay­ments, the Auditor
General shall see to it that all claims or vouchers or payrolls for the payment
to such judges and officials of any form of allowance payable out of local
funds shall be <span class="SpellE">preaudited</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Finance shall likewise
enjoin all Provincial/City Treasurers not to sign or approve any claim, voucher
or payroll for such allowances unless the same is in conformity with this
Circular.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Circular shall govern the payment of such allowances
commencing with the current fiscal year, and any previous authority in­consistent
with this Circular is hereby re­voked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Payment of such allowances during and for the current fiscal year
without the prior approval of this Office shall be adjusted and the excess or
unauthorized payments shall be refunded or set off against those becoming due
in the future.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the said memorandum circular and its amend­ments,
Memorandum Circulars Nos. 296 and 299 of November 3 and 13, 1969, respectively,
have set limits to the amounts of the allowances that may be granted by local
governments to judges and fiscals who do not receive any allowances from the
national government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if
such allowances have to be tolerated, perhaps to enable judges to meet their
needs which the national government cannot provide for, the President has
deemed it wise and, We believe, rightly, to subject the same to certain
limitations, to make sure that the amounts to be appropriated do not exceed
what are ne­cessary and reasonable in proportion to the finances of the local
governments concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, as We view them, the strictures of the President contained in the
above-quoted memorandum circular more than suggest that un­less really needed,
they should be avoided, if only to erase any possible doubt some people may
entertain regarding the justness of decisions of the local courts in cases
involv­ing local governments and/or local officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, ac­ceptance of such allowances
necessarily entails periodic representations judges would have to make before
probably minor local officials for the payment thereof, and when it is
considered that it is not very unusual for such rela­tively minor officials to
be over-conscious of their passing importance, one can easily imagine the
indignities and humiliations that judges may have to bear in the process of
collecting them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said allowances not
being a matter of right inherent in the positions of the judges, the mere possibility
that these judges might have to plead some minor local official or another for
the approval of the vouchers <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> or for the
payment thereof is in itself disgraceful to the judicial office.</p>

<p class="BODY">If there be real need for any kind of allowance for judges in
order that they may be able to maintain themselves respectably in their
stations, it is more in keeping with the dignity and independence of the
judiciary that the same be provided by the national government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, in this manner, the inequality and
uncertainty attendant to the allow­ances given by respective local governments
cannot exist, or in other words, whether or not a judge will receive any al­lowance
or how much it would be will not have to depend on the whim and caprice of any
local council or official.</p>

<p class="BODY">Salient, therefore, is the point that in making repre­sentations
for the processing of the papers concerning his transportation and gasoline
allowances with petitioners, respondent could not have been in the performance
of his official functions as a judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What he was working for was something which in legal contemplation was
purely private and personal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, as
observed above, it was something that would have been best to avoid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That respondent was, according to him,
accompanied by a local official in the person of Councilor <span class="SpellE">Abasolo</span>
Jr., certainly, did not enhance his situation - far from it, for it only served
to emphasize how much he had to depend on the benevolence of the local
officials for what, indeed, he had no strict legal right to.</p>

<p class="BODY">From these considerations, it necessarily follows that the facts
alleged in the above-quoted "Specification of Charges" filed by
respondent against petitioners cannot make out any case of contempt, whether
direct or indirect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Direct contempt as defined
by Section 1 of Rule 71 consists of "misbehavior in the presence of or so
near a court or judge as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before the
same, including disrespect toward the court or judge, offensive per­sonalities
toward others, or refusal to be sworn or to ans­wer as a witness, or to
subscribe an affidavit or deposition when lawfully required so to do." It
is true that according to this provision the misbehavior contemplated includes
"disrespect toward the …<span style="">&nbsp; </span>judge",
but it is evident that the disrespect referred to must be such as would
"obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before" the court or
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By no stretch of the imagination
can respondent's presentation to petitioners of his vouchers as well as his
request later on, to have the amounts thereof immediately obligated so as to
avoid reversion of the corresponding funds at the end of the fiscal year, on
the one hand, and the latter's refusal to favorably act on them, on the other,
be considered as part of any judicial proceeding, particularly since this
happened in the office of the petitioners in <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span>
City, decades of kilometers away from <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, the
municipality wherein respondent was then holding court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, respondent cites as "grave and ac­tual
disturbance of Court proceedings which act constituted, as it did constitute,
not only direct but also constructive contempt of court, as it had severely
impaired the adminis­tration of justice and has subjected the Court to public
contempt and ridicule", the fact that when the allegedly of­fensive <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> of the petitioners City Auditor and City
Treasurer reached him, he was in the course of trying a criminal case and he
had to suspend and/or cancel all the proceedings therein as a result of
"emotional stress", "un­told shame",
"embarrassment", "ridicule" and "mental distur­bance"
suffered by him upon receipt thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
cannot agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear to Us that
petitioners had nothing to do with the hour when their <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span>
would be delivered to and be read by respondent, specially because it does not
ap­pear that they personally and purposely took the said <span class="SpellE">in­dorsements</span>
to respondent at that particular time when he was holding court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can We see any reason why respondent,
by reacting the way he alleges he did, had to subordinate the due performance
of his official functions to the purely personal interest he had in collecting
extra-legal allowances which could only compromise his position as a judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The best statement respondent could make of his case appears in
his answer to the supplemental petition thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Before stating in details the answer of the respondent to the
aforesaid Supplementary Petition, respondent respectfully submits that contrary
to what the petitioners alleged in their original petition and reiterated in
the Supplementary Petition, the contempt proceedings was not instituted on the
non-payment of the gasoline allowance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Time and again respondent reiterates that he has waived the privilege
and bounty given to him by Resolution No. 72 of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1966</st1:date> im­mediately
upon citing the petitioners for contempt;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent insists and re-states that it was the shabby,
disrespectful and mocking treatment amounting to ri­dicule and downgrading the
Presiding Judge of the Third Branch of the 16th Judicial District was subjected
to by the petitioners, Hugo B. <span class="SpellE">Daguman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Kabalit</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Buyco</span>, when he
followed up his claim under Resolution No. 72 granting him gasoline
allowance;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have already pointed out that whatever conse­quence the
actuations of the petitioners may have pro­duced upon the respondent, the same
cannot be the basis of any contempt charge, for the simple reason that they are
not related in any manner to any judicial proceeding being conducted by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To constitute direct contempt "the
misbehavior should be committed either in the pre­sence of or so near a court,
while in session, or in the presence of or so near a court even if not in
session, in connection with the administration of justice." (Mar­tin,
Rules of Court, Vol. 3, 1969 ed., pp. 347-348, cit­ing <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>
vs. Tan, G. R. No. L-12043, <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="5">May 23,
 1958</st1:date>.) If respondent had indeed suffered what he claims, We can
only say that he unnecessarily brought them upon himself by readily accepting
magnanimity from local officials for the enjoyment of which, he should have
foreseen that he would have to cater to the impositions and demands of minor
officials, because what was being given to him was only an extra-legal
"privilege magnanimously granted." No spectacle, We reiterate, can be
more disgusting and more degrading to the dignity of the judicial office, than
that of a judge being made to appear as a mendicant before local officials over
whom he might have to exer­cise jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither could petitioners have been held guilty of constructive
contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3 of Rule 71 defines
this offense as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3. <u>Indirect contempt to be punished after charge and
hearing</u>. - After charge in writing has been filed, and an opportunity given
to the accused to be heard by himself or counsel, a person guilty of any of the
following acts may be punished for contempt:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Misbehavior of an officer of a court in the
performance of his official duties or in his official transactions;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful
writ, process, order, judgment, or com­mand of a court, or injunction granted
by a court or judge, including the act of a person who, after being
dispossessed or ejected from any real property by the judgment or process of
any court of competent jurisdiction, enters or attempts or induces another to
enter into or upon such real property, for the purpose of executing acts of
ownership or possession, or in any manner disturbs the possession given to the
person adjudged to be entitled thereto;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any abuse of or any unlawful inter­ference
with the process or proceedings of a court not constituting direct contempt
under Section 1 of this rule;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any improper conduct tending, directly or
indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming to be an attorney or an of­ficer of a
court, and acting as such without authority;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(f)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failure to obey a subpoena duly served;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(g)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rescue, or attempted rescue of a person or
property in the custody of an officer by virtue of an order or process of a
court held by him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Only sub-paragraph (d) of the above section could have any
relevance to the facts of this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to said sub-paragraph "any improper conduct tending,
directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administra­tion of
justice" may be the basis of punishment for indirect contempt after charge
and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the acts imputed to
petitioners could by any means have "impede(d), obstruct(ed) or degrade(d)
the administration of justice" or tended to do so, whether directly or
indirectly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The way We look at it, it
was the respondent's acceptance of the allowances involved here that has to a
great extent impaired his use­fulness as a judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is not the personal and private
degrading of a judge that is contumacious; it is the degrading of the
administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
facts alleged in the "Specification of Charges", not even remotely
could petitioners' unfavorable action on the respondent's vouchers and their
alleged intent to put respondent in pub­lic contempt and ridicule by such
action could constitute indirect contempt, since it is obvious that such
matters are unrelated to the exercise by respondent of his judicial functions
and authority inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City was not even
within the area over which his territorial jurisdiction ended, as respondent
was supposed to have judicial notice of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the dignity and authority of the courts must be maintained, it is
worthwhile emphasizing that "a judge should always bear in mind that the
power of the court to punish for contempt should be exercised for purposes that
are impersonal, because that power is intended as a safeguard, not for the
judges as persons, but for the functions that they exercise." (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Masaquel</span>, G. R. No. L-22536, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1967</st1:date>, 20 SCRA 1247, 1260.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Two incidents also complained of here serve to emphasize the
utter confusion in the mind of respondent as to the extent of his powers in the
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the date set for the
hearing of the charge against them, <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioners</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Auditor and Assistant City
Treasurer moved for extension of the period to file their written answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While, on the one hand, respondent pretended
to be noble to said petitioners by acceding to their prayer for extension,
"so that he may not be misunder­stood as being vindictive", on the
other hand, he <span class="SpellE">exhi­ted</span> his excessive zeal in trying
to assuage his wounded feelings by ordering their immediate arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">He now claims that he did so under the authority of Section 5 of
Rule 71 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 5. <u>Hearing; release on bail. </u>- If the hearing is
not ordered to be had forthwith, the accused may be released from custody upon
filing a bond, in an amount fixed by the court, for his ap­pearance to answer
the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the day set for the
hearing, the court shall proceed to investigate the charge and consider such
answer or testimony as the accused may make or offer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">He argues that the power to release on
bail provided for in this section, presupposes the power to order arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, respondent does not have to in­dulge
in such a deduction not altogether ineludible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last paragraph of Section 3 of the same Rule which provides that
"nothing in this section shall be so construed as to prevent the court
from issuing process to bring the accused party into court, or from holding him
in custody pending such proceedings" sufficiently gives any court
authority to have an alleged contemnor arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the power to order arrest
undeniable. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The point, however, that
under the cir­cumstances of this case, it was obviously a grave abuse of
discretion on the part of respondent to order the ar­rest of the said two
petitioners, considering that even presiding with the fact that legally there
was no con­tempt in the facts alleged against petitioners, as these Petitioners
were rather important officials of the City, there was no risk at all of their
non-appearance in the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
they asked for further time to file their answers, did not indicate at all that
they would disappear or that they would defy the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the other incident, respondent issued a memoran­dum directing
the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> to aid the Provin­cial
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental in prosecuting the con­tempt
charge here in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent did
this after said City Fiscal had already formally entered his appearance for the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever impropriety or
irregu­larity may be alleged regarding a <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
appearing as defense counsel in a contempt case, albeit in this parti­cular
case, respondent's theory that it was the duty of the fiscal to assist him in
prosecuting the contempt case does not hold because the fiscal referred to was
an assist­ant city fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> which is outside
of the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the alleged contempt, the memorandum
in question smacks not only of an attempt to deprive petitioners of the assistance
of counsel which, according to the fiscal, had been given by him upon request
of the mayor inasmuch as the charge against petitioners involved the
performance of their official duties, but of even giving to the pro­secution
the very arm he has taken away from the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an attitude of unfairness, can gain
nothing but the disapproval of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Procedurally speaking, petitioners should have awaited until the
termination of the contempt proceedings before coming to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that this case has been
pending for quite sometime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the importance of the interests of the judiciary and the administration
of justice herein involved and which We have discussed above make it imperative
that We put earlier finish to this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, no factual issues have been raised by the parties and herein
petition partakes somehow of the nature of one for habeas corpus.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> is granted, the proceedings
for contempt in the court below are hereby declared to be in grave abuse of
discretion and/or in excess of the jurisdiction of respondent judge and set

It seems more probable that the voucher for P1,100.00 was the first one
submitted since the same covers an earlier period. Moreover, it is to be noted
that the voucher for P600.00 does not appear to be covered by Resolution No.
