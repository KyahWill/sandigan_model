<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">December

the decision of the trial court acquitting the defendants of the crime charged
renders these civil cases moot and academic; (3) the trial court has no

OPPOSITIONS TO MOTION TO DISMISS filed by both plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated
Mining Company and the records of all the three civil cases, it clearly shows
that upon the issuance of said Free Patents on November 26, 1960, the same were
duly registered with the <span style="">office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>,
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 122 of Act 496, as amended, and consequently,
these properties became the private properties of the defendants, under the
operation of Sec. 38 of said Act; hence, these titles enjoy the same privileges
and safeguards as Torrens titles (Director of Lands vs. Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Carle, G.R. No. L-12485, </span><st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="7"><span style="">July 31,

P-209 and P-210 belonging to the defendants are now indefeasible and this Court
has no power to disturb such indefeasibility of said titles, let alone cancel
the same.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The principal factual
issue raised by the plaintiff, Republic of the Philippines represented by the
Director of Lands, and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, petitioner
herein, is that the lands covered by the patents and certificates of title are
timber lands and mineral lands and, therefore, not alienable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without receiving evidence, the trial court
dismissed the three (3) cases on the ground that upon the issuance of the free
patents on November 26, 1960, said patents were duly registered in the Office
of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> pursuant to
Section 122 of Act 496, as amended, and said properties became the private
properties </span>of the defendants under the operation of Section 38 of the

concluded that these titles enjoy the same privileges and safeguards as the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> title, and Original Certificates of Title Nos.

<blockquote>"On the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the
Director of Lands to dispose of the properties since they are within the forest
zone, the court finds Republic Act No. 3872, to clear this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, amending Section 44 of the Land
Act in its second paragraph states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'A member of the national cultural minorities who has continuously
occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest,

secured or disposable under this provision of the Public Land Law.'</p>

<blockquote>The 'preceding paragraph' refers to the right of a person to have a
free patent issued to him, provided he is qualified, which in this case the
Director of Lands has the jurisdiction to dispose, whether the land be
disposable or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision of
law, certainly, applies to herein defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for this law is explicit and could very well be seen from its
EXPLANATORY NOTE, which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Because of the aggressiveness of our more enterprising Christian
brothers in Mindanao, Mountain Province, and other places inhabited by members of
the National Cultural Minorities, there has been an exodus of the poor and less
fortunate non-<span class="SpellE">christians</span> from their ancestral homes
during the last ten years to the fastnesses of the wilderness where they have
settled in peace on portions of agricultural lands, unfortunately, in most
cases, within the forest zones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this
is not the end of the tragedy of the national cultural minorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the grant of pasture leases or
permits to the more <span class="SpellE">agressive</span> Christians, these
National Cultural Minorities who have settled in the forest zones for the last
ten years have been harassed and jailed or threatened with harassment and imprisonment.</p>

Public Land Act is to give the national cultural minorities a fair chance to
acquire lands of the public domain.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</p>

summarized the present state of the law thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'If a Spanish title covering forest land is found to be invalid, that
land is public forest land, is part of the public domain, and cannot be appropriated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before private interests have intervened, the
government may decide for itself what portions of the public domain shall be
set aside and reserved as forest land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Possession of forest lands, however long, cannot ripen into private
ownership.' Nor is this all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
reiterated the basic state objective on the matter in clear and penetrating
language:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The view this Court takes of
the cases at bar is but in adherence to public policy that should be followed
with respect to forest lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many have
written much, and many more have spoken, and quite often, above the pressing
need for forest preservation, conservation, protection, development and
reforestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not without
justification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, forests constitute a
vital segment of any country's natural resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of common knowledge by now that absence
of the necessary green cover on our lands produces a number of adverse or ill
effects of serious proportions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
the trees, watersheds dry up; rivers and lakes which they supply are emptied of
their contents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fish
disappears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Denuded areas become dust
bowls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As waterfalls cease to function,
so will hydroelectric plants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
rains, the fertile topsoil is washed away; geological erosion results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With erosion come the dreaded floods that
wreak havoc and destruction to property - crops, livestock, houses and highways
- not to mention precious human lives, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'"<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
