				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City (<i>a</i>)
dismissing plaintiff-appellant's complaint for the recovery of three
(3) parcels of land and their produce in the sum of P320,000.00; and (<i>b</i>)
instead, sentencing plaintiff to pay P2,000.00 for attorney's fees and
P1,000.00 for expenses of litigation, to defendant Lino Bangayan, and
P2,000.00 as attorney's fees and P500.00 as expenses of litigation, to
the other defendant Luy Kim Guan.
  <p> The pertinent facts as
found by the trial court and upon which its decision was predicated are
set forth in the following portion of the decision appealed from:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The
plaintiff Natividad Herrera is the legitimate daughter of Luis Herrera,
now deceased and who died in China sometime after he went to that
country in the last part of 1931 or early part of 1932. The said Luis
Herrera in his lifetime was the owner of three (3) parcels of land and
their improvements, known as Lots 1740, 4465 and 4467 of Expediente No.
5, G.L.R.O. Record 477 and the area, nature, improvements and
Boundaries of each and every of these three (3) lots are sufficiently
described in the complaint filed by the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p>"Before
leaving for China, however, Luis Herrera executed on December 1, 1931,
a deed of General Power of Attorney, Exhibit 'B', which authorized and
empowered the defendant Luy Kim Guan, among others to administer and
sell the properties of said Luis. Herrera.</p>
    <p>"Lot 1740 was
originally covered by Original Certificate of Title 8601 registered in
the name of Luis Herrera, married to Go Bang. This lot was sold by the
defendant Luy Kim Guan in his capacity as attorney-in-fact of the
deceased Luis Herrera to Luy Chay on September 11, 1939, as shown in
Exhibit '2', the corresponding deed of sale. Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 3162, Exhibit '3', was issued to Luy Chay by virtue of said
deed of sale. On August 28, 1941, to secure a loan of P2,000.00, a deed
of mortgage to the Zamboanga Mutual Building and Loan Association was
executed by Luy Chay, Exhibit '4'. On January 31, 1947, the said Luy
Chay executed a deed of sale, Exhibit 'E', in favor of Lino Bangayan.
By virtue of this sale, Transfer Certificate of Title T-2567 was issued
to Lino Bangayan on June 24, 1949, Exhibit '1'.</p>
    <p>"Lots 4465
and 4467 were originally registered in the name of Luis Herrera,
married to Go Bang, under Original Certificate of Title No. O-14360,
Exhibit '5'. On December 1, 1931, Luis Herrera sold one-half (1/2)
undivided share and to Luis .Herrera and Go-Bang, the other half (1/2),
as shown Exhibit '12' and Exhibit '12-A', the latter an annotation made
by the Register of Deeds of the City of Zamboanga, in which it is
stated as follows:</p>

    <p>"On
July 23, 1937, Luis Herrera thru his attorney-in-fact Luy Kim Guan, one
of the defendants, sold to Nicomedes Salazar his one-half 1/2
participation in these two (2) lots, as shown in Exhibit 'C', the
corresponding deed of sale for P3,000.00. Transfer Certificate of Title
No. T-494-(T-13045) was issued to Nicomedes Salazar and to the
defendant Luy Kim Guan, Exhibit '7'. On August 4, 1936, the defendant
Luy Kim Guan and Nicomedes Salazar executed a deed of mortgage in favor
of the Bank of the Philippine Island to secure a loan of P3,500.00,
Exhibit '6'. On August 17, 1937, the defendant Luy Kim Guan and
Nicomedes Salazar sold Lot 4465 to Carlos Eijansantos for the sum of
P100.00 as shown in Exhibits '9', corresponding deed of sale, and
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2653 was issued on September 7,
1939 to Carlos Eijasantos Exhibit '10'. Nicomedes Salazar sold his half
1/2 interest on Lot 4467 to the defendant Lino Bangayan for P3,000.00
on February 22, 1949, Exhibit 'B', and the corresponding Transfer
Certificate of Title T-2654 was issued to Lino Bangayan and to Luy Kim
Guan, both are co-owners in equal shares, Exhibits '8'. opinion of the
City Attorney, Exhibit 'p', and an affidavit of Atty. Jose T. Atilano,
Exhibit 'O', state that Lino Bangayan is a Filipino citizen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"As
admitted by both parties (plaintiffs and defendants) Luis Herrera is
now deceased, but as to the specific and precise date of his death the
evidence of both parties failed to show."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It is the contention of plaintiff-appellant that all the transactions
mentioned in the preceding quoted portion of the decision were
fraudulent and were executed after the death of Luis Herrera and,
consequently, when the power of attorney was no longer operative. It is
also claimed that the defendants Lino Bangayan and Luy Kim Guan who now
claim to be the owners of Lots Nos. 1740 and 4467 are Chinese by
nationality and, therefore, are disqualified to acquire real
properties. Plaintiff-appellant, in addition, questions the supposed
deed of sale allegedly executed by Luis Herrera on December 1, 1931 in
favor of defendant Luy Kim Guan, conveying one-half interest on the two
lots, Nos. 4465 and 4467, asserting that what was actually executed on
that date, jointly with the general power of attorney, was a lease
contract over the same properties for a period of 20 years for which
Luy Kim Guan paid the sum of P2,000.00.</p>
  <div align="justify">We
find all the contentions of plaintiff-appellant untenable. Starting
with her claim that the second deed executed on December 1, 1931 by
Luis Herrera was a lease contract instead of a deed of sale as asserted
by defendant Luy Kim Guan, we find that the only evidence in support of
her contention is her own testimony and that of her husband to the
effect that the deceased Luis Herrera showed the said document to them,
and they remembered the same to be a lease contract on the three
properties for a period of 20 years in consideration of P2,000.00.
Their testimony was sought to be corroborated by the declaration of the
clerk of Atty. Enrique A. Fernandez, who allegedly notarized the
document. Outside of this oral testimony, given more than 23 years
after the supposed instrument was read by them, no other evidence was
adduced. On the other hand, defendant Luy Kim Guan produced in evidence
a certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> signed by
the Register of Deeds of Dipolog, Zamboanga (Exh. 11) to the effect
that a deed of sale, dated December 1, 1931 executed by Luis Herrera in
favor of Luy Kim Guan and entered in the primary Book No. 4 as duly
registered on September 30, 1936 under Original Certificate of Title
No. 14360. It is to be noted that the deed of sale was registered
shortly after the issuance in the name of Luis Herrera of Original
Certificate of Title No. 14360 pursuant to Decree No. 59093, covering
the two lots, Nos. 4465 and 4467 (Exh. 5), dated April 7, 3936. In
virtue of said deed of sale of December 1, 1931, Original Certificate
of Title No. 14360 was cancelled and Transfer Certificate of Title No.
13045 (Exh. 12) in the names of the conjugal partnership of the spouses
Luis Herrera and Go Bang, one-half share, and Luy Kim Guan, single,
one-half share, was issued on September 30, 1936. Later, or on July 23,
1937, Luy Kim Guan, in his capacity as attorney-in-fact of Luis
Herrera, sold the half interest of the latter in the two parcels of
land, in favor of Nicomedes Salazar, whereupon TCT No. 13045 was
cancelled and TCT No. RT-657 (494-T-13045) (Exh. 7) was issued in the
names of Luy Kim Guan and Nicomedes Salazar in individual equal shares.
On August 4, 1937, both Luy Kim Guan and Nicomedes Salazar mortgaged
the two parcels in favor of the Bank of the Philippine Islands for the
sum of P3,500.00 (Exh. 6). On August 17, 1937, Nicomedes Salazar and
Luy Kim Guan sold their respective shares in Lot No. 4465 to Carlos
Eijansantos (Exh. 9), subject to the mortgage, resulting in the
issuance of TCT No. 2653 (Exh. 10) covering the entire lot No. 4465 in
the name of said Carlos Eijansantos. On February 23, 1949, Nicomedes
Salazar sold his half share in Lot No. 4467 to Lino Bangayan, as a
consequence of which, TCT No. 2654 (Exh. B) was issued covering said
Lot No. 4467 in the names of Luy Kim Guan and Lino Bangayan in
undivided equal shares.</div>
  <p> With respect to Lot No. 1740, the
same was sold by Luy Kim Guan, in his capacity as attorney-in-fact of
Luis Herrera, on September 11, 1939 to Lui Chay (See Exh. 2) who, in
August, 1941, mortgaged the same (Exh. 4) to the Zamboanga Mutual Loan
and building Association (See TCT No. 3162 [Exh. 3] issued in the name
of Lui Chay). Later on, Lui Chay sold the entire lot to defendant Lino
Bangayan by virtue of the deed of sale dated January 31, 1947 (Exh. E),
and as a consequence thereof, TCT No. 2567 was issued in the name of
said vendee. (See Exh. 1). As a result of these various transactions,
duly recorded in the corresponding office of the Register of Deeds, and
covered by appropriate transfer certificates of title, the properties
are now registered in the following manner: Lot No. 1740, in the name
of Lino Bangayan; Lot No. 4465, in the name of Carlos Eijansantos; and
Lot No. 4467, in the names of Lino Bangayan and Luy Kim Guan in
undivided equal shares.</p>
  <p> In the face of these documentary
evidence presented by the defendants, the trial court correctly upheld
the contention of the defendants as against that of plaintiff-appellant
who claims that the second deed executed by Luis Herrera in 1931 was a
lease contract. It is pertinent to note what the lower court stated in
this regard, that is, if the second deed executed by Luis Herrera was a
lease contract covering the 3 lots in question for a period of twenty
(20) years, there would have been no purpose for him to constitute Luy
Kim Guan as his attorney-in-fact to administer and take charge of the
same properties already covered by the lease contract.</p>
  <p>
Coming now to the contention that these transactions are null and void
and of no effect because they were executed by the attorney-in-fact
after the death of his principal, suffice it to say that as found by
the lower court, the date of death of Luis Herrera has not been
satisfactorily proven. The only evidence presented by the
plaintiff-appellant in this respect is a supposed letter received from
a certain "Candi", dated at Amoy in November, 1936, purporting to give
information that Luis Herrera (without mentioning his name) had died in
August of that year. This piece of evidence was properly rejected by
the lower court for lack of identification. On the other hand, we have
the testimony of the witness Lu Chung Lian to the effect that when he
was in Amoy in the year 1940, Luis Herrera visited him and had a
conversation with him, showing that the latter was still alive at the
time. Since the documents had been executed by the attorney-in-fact one
in 1937 and other in 1939, it is evident, if we are to believe this
testimony, that the documents were executed during the lifetime of the
principal. Be that as it may, even granting <i>arguendo</i> that Luis
Herrera did die in 1936, plaintiffs presented no proof and there is no
indication in the record, that the agent Luy Kim Guan was aware of the
death of his principal at the time he sold the property. The death of
the principal does not render the act of an agent unenforceable, where
the latter had no knowledge of such extinguishment of the agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
  <p>
Appellants also raise the question of the legality of the titles
acquired by Lui Chay and Lino Bangayan, on the ground that they are
disqualified to acquire real properties in the Philippines. This point
is similarly without merit because there is no evidence to support the
claim. In fact, in the deed of sale as well as in TCT No. 3162 issued
to Lui Chay, the latter was referred to as a citizen of the
Philippines. Nevertheless, the lower court acknowledged the probability
that Lui Chay could have been actually a Chinese citizen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
At any rate, the property was subsequently purchased by Lino Bangayan,
as a result of which TCT No. 3162 in the name of Lui Chay was cancelled
and another certificate (TCT No. T-2567) was issued in favor of said
vendee.</p>
  <p> As to Bangayan's qualification, the lower court held
that said defendant had sufficiently established his Philippine
citizenship through Exhibit P, concurred in by the Secretary of
Justice. We find no reason to disturb such ruling.</p>
  <p> With
respect to Luy Kim Guan, while it is true that he is a Chinese citizen,
nevertheless, inasmuch as he acquired his one-half share in Lot No.
4467 in 1931, long before the Constitution was adopted, his ownership
can not be attacked on account of his citizenship.</p>
  <p>    Appellants, in this appeal, contest the judgment of the       court <i>a quo</i>
awarding defendants Lino Bangayan and Luy Kim Guan attorney's fees in
the sum of P2,000.00 each, and expenses of litigation in the amounts of
P1,000.00 and P500.00, respectively. We agree with the appellant in
this regard.</p>
  <p> This Court has laid down the rule that in the
absence of stipulation, a winning party may be awarded attorney's fees
only in case plaintiff's action or defendant's stand is so untenable as
to amount to gross and evident bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
The same thing, however, can not be said of the case at bar. As a
matter of fact, the trial court itself declared that the complaint was
filed in good faith. Attorney's fees, therefore, can not be awarded to
defendants simply because the judgment was favorable to them and
adverse to plaintiff, for it may amount to imposing a premium on the
right to redress grievances in court. And so with expenses of
litigation. A winning party may be entitled to expenses of litigation
only where he, by reason of plaintiff's clearly unjustifiable claims or
'defendant's unreasonable refusal to his demands, was compelled to
incur said expenditures. Evidently, the facts of this case do not
warrant the granting of such litigation expenses to defendants. In the
absence of proof, that the action was intended for reasons other than
honest, we may agree with the trial court that the same must have been
instituted by plaintiffs in their belief that they have a valid cause
against the defendants.</p>
  <p> Wherefore, and with the above
modification, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed in all
other respects, without prejudice to appellants' right to demand from
the agent (Luy Kim Guan) an accounting of the proceeds of the agency,
if such right is still available. No costs. So ordered.</p>
