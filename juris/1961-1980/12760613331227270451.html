				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>These are appeals by the plaintiff corporation, the administratrix of the 
estate of the late Bernardo S. Dungao and the Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co., 
Inc., from a judgment and supplementary judgment rendered by the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, the dispositive parts of which read, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is hereby rendered in favor 
of the plaintiff ordering the defendant to pay to said plaintiff the sum of 
P5,138.02, plus 12% interest thereon from June 15, 1949, until fully paid, 
together with 20% thereof or P1,027.60as attorney's fees. Defendant's counter 
claim is hereby ordered dismissed. </p>
<p>With costs against the defendant. </p>
<p align="center">* * * </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, judgment is likewise rendered in favor of plaintiff ordering the 
respondent Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., to pay jointly and severally, 
with the defendant to said plaintiff the sum of P5,138.02, plus 12% interest 
thereon from April 2, 1958, until fully paid, together with 20% thereof 
orP1,027.60 as attorney's fees, (Civil Case No.8535) </p></blockquote>
<p>certified by the Court of Appeals to this Court, for the reason that "the 
question of jurisdiction raised by the parties is of such a substantial 
character that it necessarily removes this case (appeals) from the appellate 
competence of this Court." </p>
<p>It appears that on 18, 21 and 29 September 1948, Bernardo S. Dungao executed 
in favor of Macondray &amp; Co., Inc., three promissory notes for the total sum 
of P6,100, and on 17 December 1948, to replace the three promissory notes, he 
executed in favor of the same party, a promissory note for the sum of P6,100 
payable by installments, with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the 
date of execution of the note and with the stipulation that in default of 
payment of the principal and interest, when due and payable, the total balance 
and interest would become due and payable, and that an additional sum equivalent 
to 20% of the total balance and Interest would be paid to the holder by way of 
attorney's fees and cost of collection. </p>
<p>Bernardo S. Dungao paid the amount of P961.98 on the principal and interest 
up to 15 June 1949 but defaulted in subsequent payments to Macondray &amp; Co., 
Inc., and despite several demands on him, he failed and refused to pay. So, on 1 
July 1949 Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. brought an action in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila against him for the collection of the balance of the 
principal amounting to P5,138.02, the stipulated interest thereon and attorney's 
fees. Upon motion of the plaintiff, Macondray &amp; Co., Inc., a writ of 
attachment was issued on 16 August 1949, but this was later on dissolved on 21 
September 1949, when the defend-ant put up a surety bond subscribed by the 
defendant, asprincipal, and the Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., as 
surety. The extent of the obligation under the bond appears, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, we, Bernardo S. Dungao, as principal, and the Rizal Surety &amp; 
Insurance Company, as surety, in consideration of the dissolution of said order 
of attachment, hereby jointly and severally bind ourselves in the sum of Six 
Thousand One Hundred Sixty-five Pesos &amp; 62/100 (P6,165.62), Philippine 
currency, under the condition that incase the plaintiff recover judgment in the 
action, the defendant will, on demand, pay to the plaintiff the full value of 
the property so released, or pay to the plaintiff any judgment the latter may 
recover in the action, upon the plaintiffs compliance with the provisions of the 
Rules of Court. </p></blockquote>
<p>Before the trial of the case, Bernardo S. Dungao died on 30 July 1952. On 6 
August 1952 counsel for the deceased Bernardo S. Dungao moved for the dismissal 
of the case on the ground that this action being for recovery of money did not 
survive the defendant who had died. Meanwhile, in the Court of First Instance of 
Rizal, administration proceedings for the settlement of the estate of the late 
Bernardo S. Dungao was commenced and Maria Gervacio Bias Vda. de Dungao, the 
widow of the late Bernardo S. Dungao, was appointed administratrix of the 
estate. On 14 July 1954, the Courtof First Instance of Manila ordered the 
substitution of thedefendant Bernardo S. Dungao, deceased, by Maria Gervacio 
Bias Vda. de Dungao, as party defendant in the case. On 31 July, administratrix 
Maria Gervacio Bias Vda. de Dungao moved for the dismissal of the case on the 
same ground as that set forth in the motion of 6 August 1952. On 15 November, 
the motion to dismiss was denied. On 15 September 1955, the administratrix 
renewed her motion for the dismissal of the case, on the ground that on 23 
November 1953 the plaintiff had filed in the intestate proceedings of the late 
Bernardo S. Dungao pending in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (case No. 
1714) a "Manifestation of Creditor" claiming "the amount of P5,128.02 plus 
twelve per cent (12%) interest thereon from June 15, 1949, P1,027.60 for 
attorney's fees and costs," and praying that in the distribution of the estate 
of the deceased the claim of Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. be taken into account. On 
26 September 1955, the third motion to dismiss was denied. </p>
<p>On 13 February 1956 the parties submitted a stipulation of facts dated 6 
February 1956 which reads, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now come the parties with their respective undersigned attorneys and to this 
Honorable Court respectfully submit the following agreed stipulation of facts

Court of First Instance of Rizal, entitled "Intestado del Finado Bernardo S. 
Dungao" was ordered substituted as defendant in this-case; </p>

<p>Dear Sir: </p>
<p>Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. has requested me to take your car and truck in view 
of your failure to pay the overdue installments on the promissory notes which 
you signed to cover the purchase prices thereof. In the hope that you will avoid 
all the troubles incident to judicial proceedings, I expect that you will pay

<p>Sir:</p>
<p>With reference to your letter to me dated February 12, 1949, which I received 
on February 26, 1949, in which you stated that the Macondray &amp; Company 
advised you to take back the four trucks I bought from them. In this connection, 
I wish to tell you that those trucks are at your disposal. Of course, when I 
bought these trucks I had an agreement with Mr. Lackwood that in case I find 
these small trucks to be unfit to my line or the running of which will be 
losing, I am given the privilege to return them to the Company and change them 
with new ones. Such being the case, I am turning them back to your Company for I 
have been losing so much for I had them repaired and repainted. However, if the 
two Ford trucks can be separated from the four trucks Join-Obligation, I will be 
willing to retain them provided that I will be required only to pay Two Hundred 
Pesos(P200.00) monthly for the two trucks simply because the business now is 
very slow as everybody finds it. I wish to inform you further that ever since I 
received your letter I stopped using them. In brief, you have the full 
disposition and discretion in this matter without resorting to court 
litigation.</p>
<p>Before closing I wish to reiterate in my request that if the accounts of the 
two Ford trucks can be separated from the Join-Promissory Note that I signed and 
I will be allowed to pay Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00) monthly for these two 
trucks then I am willing to retain them and if not acceptable to your Company, 
then the trucks will be sent to your shop or you can get them from my 
garage.</p>

<p>After hearing, on 5 March, 2 August, and 23 September,1958, judgment, 
supplementary judgment and order, respectively, were rendered by the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, as stated at the beginning of this opinion. </p>
<p>On 27 March 1958, in the said Court of First Instance of Manila, the 
plaintiff Macondray &amp; Co., Inc., filed a motion alleging that the estate of 
the deceased Bernardo S. Dungao was insolvent and therefore praying that the 
Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co,, Inc., be made to pay the amount of the 
judgment. The surety company objected to the motion on the ground that the 
judgment was not yet final. On 19April 1958, the court directed the surety 
company to file a responsive pleading to the plaintiff1s motion for the purpose 
of joining the issues. On 29 May 1958 the surety company filed the responsive 
pleading entitled "Amended Answer," setting up the defense (1) that the court 
had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the plaintiff's claim against it (the 
surety company) and the deceased defendant;(2) that as the surety company was 
not served with notice of the Judgment rendered on 5 March 1958 the same could 
not be enforced against it; (3) that the step taken by the plaintiff to make it 
liable on its bond is premature and too late in so far as it sought to establish 
its (surety’s)liability; and (4) that the plaintiff is guilty of laches in 
prosecuting its claim against it. </p>
<p>The plaintiff presented evidence in support of its motion against the surety 
company on the date set for hearing, but the surety company waived presentation 
of evidence in its behalf. </p>
<p>On 2 August, and 23 September, 1958, the court rendered a supplementary 
judgment and entered an order referred to herein before. </p>
<p>On 30 September 1958, the plaintiff Macondray &amp; Co., Inc., moved for a 
reconsideration of the order entered on23 September 1958 in so far as it awards 
interest on the plaintiff's claim from 2 April 1958 only and not from 15 June 
1949. On 13 October 1958, the surety company objected to the motion for 
reconsideration filed by the plaintiff. On 20 October, the court denied the 
motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiff and, at the same time, granted 
the surety company an opportunity to file its own motion for reconsideration. On 
24 October, the Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the order entered on 23 September 1958 modifying the 
supplementary judgment rendered on 2 August 1958, on the ground that the said 
order had no basis in law and that it contravened the provisions of the 
indemnity bond executed by the defendant to dissolve the attachment issued in 
case No. 8535 of the Court of First Instance of Manila. On 25 November 1958 the 
plaintiff Macondray &amp; Co., Inc., objected to the motion for reconsideration 
filed by the Rizal Surety &amp;Insurance Co., Inc. On 2 December 1958, the 
motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>
<p>The plaintiff assigns an error claimed to have been committed by the trial 
court, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lower court erred in ordering the Rizal Surety &amp; Insurance Co., inc., 
to pay interest only from April 2, 1958 instead of from June 15, 
1949.</p></blockquote>
<p>The defendant Bernardo S. Dungao (deceased), represented by administratrix 
Maria Gervacio Bias vda. de Dungao, assigns five errors allegedly committed by 
the trial court, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>
<p>When the lower court assumed jurisdiction and decided the case at bar. </p>
</li><li>
<p>In not declaring that the order of attachment and the counter bond filed by 
defendant Bernardo S. Dungao have no legal effect after the death of the said 
Bernardo S. Dungao and in not including the bondsman as party in this case. ; 
</p>
</li><li>
<p>In admitting documents marked as Exhibits G, G-l, G-2, H, I and J as evidence 
in this case when they are incompetent. </p>
</li><li>
<p>In not declaring that the purchase con-tracts marked as Exhibits B, C and D 
and the consolidating promissory note marked as Exhibit A has (have) been 
novated in view of the letter of Bernardo S. Dungao of March 16, 1949 accepted 
by the plaintiff-Appellee and the payment made by said Bernardo S. Dungao marked 
as Exhibits E and F for the plaintiff-appellee and 10 and 11 for the 
administratrix-appellant. </p>
</li><li>
<p>In ordering the defendant-appellant to pay the sum of P5,138.02, plus 12% 
interest thereon from June 15, 1949 until fully paid without considering the 
payment made on account by the deceased Bernardo S. 
Dungao.</p></li></ol></blockquote>
<p>And the surety company assigns four errors claimed to have been committed by 
the trial court, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>The lower court erred in taking cognizance of the case involving as it does 
a simpleclaim for money against the deceased Bernardo S. Dungao, principal of 
the bond. <br><br>
</li><li>The lower court erred in holding appellant-surety's bond liable for the 
claim of plain-tiff in the amount of P5.138.02. <br><br>
</li><li>The lower court erred in charging interest on appellant-surety1s bond at the 
rate of 12% per annum from April 2, 1958. <br><br>
</li><li>The lower court erred in awarding attorney's fees equivalent to 20% of the 
claim of plaintiff, or P1,027.60. </li></ol></blockquote>
<p>The first point or question to determine in these appeals is whether the 
Court of First Instance of Manila had jurisdiction to take cognizance and decide 
the case, in spite of the fact that before the trial thereof the court was 
apprised of the demise of the defendant on 30 July 1952. The action brought 
against him being for recovery of money, the same should have been dismissed to 
be prosecuted in the manner especially provided in the Rules of Court. </p>
<p>Section 21 of Rule 3, Rules of Court, provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the action is for recovery of money, debt or interest thereon, and the 
defendant dies before final judgment in the Court of First Instance, it shall be 
dismissed to be prosecuted in the manner especially provided in these rules. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 7 of Rule 86, Rules of Court, provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A creditor holding a claim against the deceased secured by mortgage or other 
collateral security, may abandon the security and prosecute his claim in the 
manner provided in this rule, and share in the general distribution of the 
assets of the estate; or he may foreclose his mortgage or realize upon his 
security, by action in court, making the executor or administrator a party 
defendant, and if there is a judgment for a deficiency, after the sale of the 
mortgaged premises, or the property pledged, in the foreclosure or other 
proceeding to realize upon the security, he may claim his deficiency judgment in 
the manner provided in the preceding section; or he may rely upon his mortgage 
or other security alone, and foreclose the same at any time within the period of 
the statute of limitations, and in that event he shall not be admitted as a 
creditor, and shall receive no share in the distribution of the other assets of 
the estate; but nothing herein contained shall prohibit the executor or 
administrator from redeeming the property mortgaged or pledged, by paying the 
debt for which it is held as security, under the direction of the court, if the 
court shall adjudge it to be for the best interest of the estate that such 
redemption shall be made. </p></blockquote>
<p>There seems to be no doubt that the action brought by the plaintiff 
corporation is for collection or recovery of money. The prayer of the complaint 
unmistakably appears to or collection be for recovery of a sum of money. And 
although at the bottom of the promissory note sued upon and before the signature 
of the obligor there appears the following: "The payment of this note is secured 
by mortgage on personal property," yet it does not appear that the plaintiff 
sought to foreclose it, as the personal property mortgaged to secure the payment 
of the promissory note is not described in the complaint. The attachment levied 
on some properties of the defendant, on the plaintiff's motion, to secure 
payment of its money claim, might constitute an exception to the general rule on 
claims that do not survive, as provided for in section21 of Rule 3, Rules of 
Court. But after the discharge of the attachment upon the filing of a bond by 
the surety company, the property attached became free from any specific lien and 
reverted to its previous condition. </p>
<p>The reason behind the rule of non-survival of money claims is to grant all 
creditors a proportionate share in the estate of the deceased debtor should the 
same be in-sufficient to pay fully the debts that the deceased had contracted in 
his lifetime and owed his creditors. </p>
<p>The action brought by the plaintiff being one for recovery of money, debt or 
interest thereon did not survive after the death of the defendant debtor. As 
already stated, the case should have been dismissed to be prosecuted in the 
manner especially provided in the Rules of Court. </p>
<p>Having arrived at this conclusion, the other points raised by the parties 
need not be passed upon. </p>
<p>As to the bond filed by the surety company, the same having been filed to 
secure the discharge of the writ of attachment validly issued by the Court of 
First Instance of Manila on the properties of the defendant before his death to 
answer for any money judgment that may be rendered against him, It must be 
deemed to subsist or continue to answer for any money claim of the plaintiff 
corporation that may be allowed by the probate court-- the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal —in the probate proceedings instituted for the administration 
and settlement of the estate of the late Bernardo S. Dungao, because the 
dismissal of the action after the death of the defendant is directed by the 
Rules of Court and the filing of the money claim in the probate proceedings is 
just a continuation of the action brought by the plaintiff corporation to 
collect the sum of money owed to it by the defendant, subject, of course, to 
such defense or defenses that may be set up by the surety company to be 
determined by the probate court. As a matter of fact, the plaintiff corporation 
already has filed in the probate court its money claim for its allowance. </p>
<p>The judgments and order appealed from are set aside, without prejudice to the 
filing of the money claim by the plaintiff corporation with the probate court of 
the province of Rizal and without special pronouncement as to costs.
