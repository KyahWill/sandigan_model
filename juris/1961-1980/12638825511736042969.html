				<BR><STRONG>MAKASIAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a verified letter-complaint, dated September 11, 1973,
addressed to the NBI Sub-Office in <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, Cesar M. <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>, a <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> Assistant Provincial Fiscal, complained that Atty.
Gregorio Bautista, Deputy Clerk of Branch IV, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, committed acts
unbecoming an officer of the court and derogatory to the public service, when,
on September 10, 1973, between 1:30 and 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, said
respondent, evidently under the influence of liquor and for no reason at all,
uttered defamatory statements against him and his wife, Marjorie R. <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>, a subordinate employee in the same court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> NBI Sub-Office
conducted an investigation of the complaint; filed the corresponding criminal
case for grave slander in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, docketed therein as Criminal Case No. 2314;
and referred the administrative aspect of the case to this Court for
corresponding action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, respondent denied all the charges
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he admitted that
"in the interest of truth, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> I drink
occasionally but I do not report for work under the influence of liquor in the
manner I am pictured to have been doing so in the report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember of three occasions only between
August 16, 1971 which is the date of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of my appointment herein and September 11, 1973 wherein I was a little bit
drunk in going to the office, and all of these took place after lunch time --
the reason being that I failed to resist the tempting offers for drink by the
company with whom I was then with (sic) in taking my lunch on these
occasions."</p>

<p class="BODY">By Resolution of this Court's First Division, dated <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1976</st1:date>, this case was
referred to the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Investigating Judge recommended "that Administrative
Matter No. P-226 <span class="GramE">be</span> dismissed, the case considered
closed and the respondent exonerated." Evidently, the recommendation of
the Investigating Judge was anchored on the failure of complainant and his wife
to appear, despite notice, at the investigation of the case on <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1976</st1:date>, and on the affidavit
of desistance filed earlier by Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>
in behalf of his wife.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(WE cannot subscribe to
the aforesaid recommendation for exoneration of the respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Evidence which <span class="GramE">are</span> documentary in
character appearing in the records of this case reveal that indeed respondent
misbehaved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A certification, dated
September 12, 1973, issued by the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, shows that in the police blotter of September
9, 1973 "at around 2:30 PM Atty. Gregorio Bautista, Deputy Clerk of Court
at CFI, Branch IV, <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
created a public disorder at the Office of the Municipal Secretary while <span style="">under the influence of liquor."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, when respondent was summoned to appear in the Office of the
National Bureau of Investigation, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, to explain his side in connection with the
complaint of Assistant Provincial Fiscal Cesar <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>,
Senior NBI Agent Cesar B. de <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
reported: "It is noteworthy to mention in this connection that Subject
(respondent) was afforded a chance to defend himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of complying with the NBI
summons addressed to him, he appeared in the Office disgracefully drunk and was
not at all in a physical state to explain."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing documentary proofs, which remain <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>, coupled with respondent's admission that on
"three occasions only between August 16, 1971 which is the date of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of my appointment herein and September 11, 1973
wherein I was a little bit drunk in going to the office and all of these took
place after lunch time -- the reason being that I failed to resist the tempting
offers for drink by the company with whom <span style="">I
was then with (sic) in taking my lunch on these occasions," unerringly
reveal that indeed respondent misbehaved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There <span style="">is, </span>therefore,
reasonable ground to believe that he is guilty of conduct prejudicial to the
best interest of the service and unbecoming an officer of the court) (The
affidavit of desistance </span>executed by the wife of complainant, Marjorie R.
<span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>, on October 7, 1976, which was submitted by
the respondent for the purpose of dismissing this administrative case, becomes
immaterial to this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To condition
administrative action upon the will of every complainant, who may, for one
reason or another, condone a detestable act, is to strip the proper authorities
of their power to discipline persons in the public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so, if WE consider that administrative
offenses affect not only rights of private individuals but also those of the
public, and where, as in the instant case, the charge can be proved by other
evidence independent of the stand of the complainant and his wife) (<u>Apropos </u>to
state, in this connection, is the fact that respondent's position as branch
clerk of court calls for constant contact with the public, and naturally any
indecorous or censurable act such as drunkenness during office hours adversely
affects public opinion concerning the courts as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent is duty bound to maintain a high
degree of respectability at all times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such is the norm of conduct impose as a condition of employment in the
government service.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, RESPONDENT ATTY. GREGORIO BAUTISTA, </span>DEPUTY
CLERK OF BRANCH IV OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF PANIQUI, TARLAC, IS HEREBY
