<blockquote>From the pleadings and annexes, the following appears:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The OBM is a commercial banking corporation
duly organized and existing under the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
with principal office at <st1:address><st1:street>Rosario Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners are the majority and controlling
stockholders thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The OBM was opened
for business on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="1">6 January 1964</st1:date>
with authorized capital of P30 million, P10 million subscribed and P8 million
thereof paid, but had been suspended by respondent from clearing with the CB
and from lending opera­tions for various violations of the banking laws and
implementing regula­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
charged that the OBM became financially distressed because of this suspension
and the deprivation by the CB of all the usual credit facilities and
accommodations accorded to the other banks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The alleged <span class="GramE">exactions of onerous fines and penalties
by respondent was</span> likewise blamed for the aggravated situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its deficiencies it was made subject to
penalties of 12% interest on <span class="SpellE">overdrawings</span> and 36% per
annum on reserve deficiencies, which by 1968 amounted to several millions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By April, 1967, the financial situation of the OBM had caused
mounting concern in the CB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
Ramos and the OBM management finally met with respondent CB on the necessity
and urgency of rehabilitating the OBM through the extension of necessary
financial assistance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The upshot of these conferences appears from the correspondence
exchanged between the GB and the OBM.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="5">2 May 1967</st1:date>,
the Governor of the Central Bank, Andres Castillo, upon instructions of the
Monetary Board, wrote a letter (Petition, Annex "B") stating:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"This is with reference to the conference had between Mr. <span class="SpellE">Emerito</span> Ramos, Sr., Chairman of your Board, and the
undersigned, the Deputy Governor, the Acting Superintendent of Banks, and the
Officer-in-Charge, Accounting Department of this Bank, last Friday evening on
the present very precarious condition of the Over­seas Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the conference, we described to Mr. Ramos
at length the circumstances which led to the present precarious condition of
the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stressed the imminent
danger of the bank's being thrown out of clearing, in accordance with existing
Central Bank regulations, on account of its continuous adverse clearing
balances, and of the immediate necessity of putting up ad­ditional capital in
the amount of at least P3 million, which Mr. Ramos promised to put up when he
last appeared before the Monetary Board.</p>

<p class="2Q">I informed Mr. Ramos that if his bank is thrown out of clearing,
the Central Bank will proceed in accordance with the existing policy under
which he and other stockholders representing a majority will have to sign a
trusteeship agreement with the Philippine National Bank pursuant to which the
Overseas Bank will be managed by the Philip­pine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the PNB takes over manage­ment in such
eventuality, the Central Bank could also announce that it is ready to support
the Philip­pine National Bank in order to allay the fears of depositors and
creditors."</p>

<blockquote>In view of the OBM stockholders' reluctance to execute the Voting
Trust suggested, the Monetary Board adopted Resolution No. 2015 dated <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="10">16 October 1967</st1:date>, having the
following terms (Petition, Annex "F"):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">"'(1) To require
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Emerito</span> M. Ramos, Sr., the principal stockholder
of the Overseas Bank of Manila, to submit a listing of his properties and to
mortgage or assign the same to the Central Bank to cover the overdraft balance
therewith of the Overseas Bank of Manila;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">"'(2) To require
the stockholders of the Over­seas Bank of Manila to subscribe to an appropriate
voting trust agreement so that the Central Bank may be able to effect a complete
reorganization and/or transfer the management of the bank to a nominee of the
Monetary Board;'"</p>

<blockquote>Further conference ensued, and on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="10">30 October 1967</st1:date> Governor Castillo of the CB wrote again
(Petition, Annex "G"):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"I wish to refer to the conference had between your <span class="SpellE">goodself</span> and the members of the Monetary Board at <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="10">16
 October 1967</st1:date>, relative to the financial condition and state of
affairs of The Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
of which the substantial majority of stock is owned by you and your family and
corporations controlled by you.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Among other things, the Monetary Board, having in mind the
overdrawing in your deposit account with the Central Bank which, on that date,
stood at P22.3 million, together with the balance of your past due emergency
loan with the Central Bank amounting to P10.3 million ex­clusive of accumulated
interest, decided that, as a measure to stave off liquidation, a voting trust
agreement should be executed by you and your family and the corporations
controlled by you in favor of the Superintendent of Banks, in an instrument
similar to the one executed by stockholders of the Republic Bank in favor of
the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="10">23 October 1967</st1:date>, the Legal Counsel
of this Bank submitted to you a draft of such "Voting Trust Agreement"
desired by the Monetary Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
on 25 October 1967, you handed the Legal Counsel your own draft of a
"Trust Agreement" which, in essence, is not a voting trust agreement
as desired by the Monetary Board and reiterated in its Resolution No. 2020
dated 20 October, 1967 and confirmed on 24 October 1967,"</p>

<blockquote>This was followed up by another letter of <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="11">8 November 1967</st1:date> (Petition, Annex "H"):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"In line with the conference this morning between your <span class="SpellE">goodself</span> and the under­signed, the Deputy Governor, the Acting
Super­intendent of Banks, and the Central Bank Legal Counsel, and your
manifestation of readiness to abide by the decisions of the Monetary Board on
all matters involving the Overseas Bank of Manila, it is requested that the
voting trust agreement prepared by the Legal Counsel of this Bank be now signed
by you and other members of your family and by the proper of­ficials of the
corporations which are stock­holders of the bank and which are controlled by
you and your family.</p>

<p class="2Q">"It is also requested that the execution of the mortgages on
the properties you offered as security for the obligations of the Overseas Bank
of Manila to the Central Bank be finalized, and the shares of stock belonging
to you and your family in your corporations and enterprises be endorsed in
favor of the Central Bank and de­livered to us as soon as possible."</p>

<blockquote>Finally, on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">20 November
 1967</st1:date>, the petitioners herein executed the Voting Trust Agreement

<blockquote>Petitioners likewise conveyed by way of mortgage to the CB all
their private properties and holdings to secure the obligations of the OBM to
the CB, but there is no agreement as to the value of these properties,
petitioners contending that they are worth over 141 million, but the CB
appraised them at around 67 million (Petition, Annexes "B" and
"C").</blockquote>

<blockquote>But as early as 25 September 1967, Mr. Martin <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>,
who had become president of OBM only since 13 March 1967, had written to the
Superinten­dent of Banks that transactions worth around P48 million, of which
over P43 million were time deposits, at usurious rates of interest, had not
been incorporated in the Bank's books nor reported to the Board of
Directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was explained<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>
that the OBM management had resorted to these unrecorded transactions because
the suspension of its lending activities after 14 months of operation reduced
OBM to virtual inactivity, and it had to agree to pay high premiums or
interests on such deposits because this high costs is com­paratively cheaper
than the Central Bank's interests on <span class="SpellE">overdrawings</span> at
the rate of 12% per annum and a penalty of 36% per annum on reserve
deficiencies.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Oliva's</span> letter prompted a further
investigation of OBM records by the CB examiners that revealed allegedly
unrecorded deposits and transactions (which is disputed by Petitioners)
amounting to 48,007,211 as of 13 Sept­ember 1967 (reduced to P35 million when
petition was filed); diversion of deposits to accounts controlled by certain
OBM officials (so-called COFICO and EMRACO accounts) and loans to the Ramos
family and firms controlled by them.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> Petitioners contend that these
transactions were recorded in subsidiary ledger accounts that were linked to
the general ledger accounts of the Bank under the so-called EMRACO and COFICO
accounts, and finally incorporated in <span class="GramE">OBM' s</span> regular
books in September, 1967 upon instructions of President Martin Oliva.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>
And as to the loans to the Ramos family and firms, the same had been written
off when around 31 July 1967 the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span> conveyed to
the OBM properties worth P54.096 million.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="10">27 October 1967</st1:date>,
the Superintendent of Banks reported that the condition of the OBM was one of
insolvency, calling for applica­tion of Section 29 of the Central Bank Act and
liquidation of OBM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, with the
listing of Ramos properties worth 100 million, it was added, a new possibility
emerged to recapitalize the OBM in 100 million.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">"2. However,
with the letter dated <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="10">October 26,
 1967</st1:date> of Mr. Martin R. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, President of
the Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, giving
a list of the Ramos properties worth P100 million (?), a radically different
possibi­lity has emerged.</p>

<p class="2Q">"If the valuation of the P100 million (net of encumbrances to
the parties other than the CB and TOBM) to the properties is true, or
substantially true, then the new 'possibility' may be briefly stated thus:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">"A <u>Recapitalization</u>
of the Overseas Bank of Manila on the amount of P100 million will save the
bank, because -- as a general proposition, subject of course to corroborative
quantification -- ­such a magnitude of capital can make good the bad loans as
well as the funds that cannot be legitimately accounted for, and can absorb the
losses in bad debts, can provide it with funds for viable operations, and thus
ultimately give adequate protection to depositors and creditors.</p>

<blockquote>In the same memorandum report, considering the need for liquid
funds, the Superintendent of Banks suggested the following alternatives:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">"(1) The OBM be
required to acquire the properties in payment for frozen or bad loans or for
unaccountable funds, and then mortgage the properties to CB for emergency
advances, or</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">(2<span class="GramE">)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> owners be required to mortgage the
properties to the CB directly, and for CB to extend loans to OBM depending on
the needs."</p>

<blockquote>Three days later, 30 October 1967, the Central Bank governor wrote
to the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Emerito</span> Ramos, reiterating the
need for the OBM stockholders to execute a voting trust agreement" to
stave off liquidation", which letter was followed by another of 8 November
1967, requiring the execution of the Voting Trust Agreement by the OBM
stockholders and of the mortgage of their properties to secure OBM obligations
to the Central Bank and the endorsement of the shares of stock held by them in
their cor­porations and enterprises (Petition, Annexes "G" and
"H", quoted pre­viously).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners duly complied (Annexes "A", "C" and
"S") in November, 1967.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="12">5 December 1967</st1:date>,
new directors and officers drafted from the CB itself, the PNB and DBP were
elected and installed and they took over the management and control of the <span class="GramE">Overseas</span> bank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="6">14 June 1968</st1:date>,
the CB announced that only P10 million were available as emergency loan to OBM
and requested the management of the latter (appointed under the Voting Trust
Agreement to replace the old Board elected by the stockholders) to project how
it could help bail out OBM.</blockquote>

<blockquote>OBM president, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Orosa</span>, submitted a
"Projected Cash Flow Statement"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> concluding -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"It is pointed out here that with the P10 million <span class="GramE">loan</span> from the CB, the extremely distressed financial
condition of TOBM will con­tinue to prevail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At best, the P10 million <span class="GramE">loan</span> will enable TOBM
to resume limited lending operations on a highly selected basis and diminish
its estimated loss by some P492.5 thousand assuming that the loans to be
extended have a high turnover rate and a 100% repayment ratio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, with the P10 million CB loan, the
annual loss has been estimated to be P8.9 million.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be able to breakdown in operations,
therefore, TOBM needs <span class="SpellE">loanable</span> funds estimated at
P196 million, pla­cing the cost of such funds at 1-1/2%."</p>

<blockquote>In a memorandum submitted to Governor <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>
12 days later, 22 July, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Orosa</span> unburdened himself
and deplored CB for hemming and hawing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This caused, he said, the loss of "psychological advantage"
initially gained by <span class="SpellE">PNB's</span> take over of the OBM
management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reminded the CB Governor
about the OBM management's request on <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="1">6
 January 1968</st1:date> for a P20 million loan to enable OBM to get on its feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At that time", he said, "the
aid we are recommending, properly used, would have staved off panic and
restored some confidence."</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Eight months of indecision has made de­positors lose faith
and as a result, we are faced with more court suits and withdrawals than ever
before and more obligations have matured."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>The next day, <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="7">23 July 1958</st1:date>,
the Superintendent of Banks recommended to the Monetary Board that OBM be
liquidated under Section 29, Republic Act 265, if its "capital structure
cannot be strengthened to meet the re­quirements of Section 22 of RA 337"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a>,
and if "massive financing cannot be given to enable the bank to expand its
risk assets".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He concluded that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“………The bank's continuance in business under its present extremely
pre­carious financial condition, without the neces­sary capital injection and
financial aid, will involve not merely probable, but <u>certain further losses
to its depositors and other creditors</u> and may have further <u>adverse
effects on the banking system</u>."</p>

<blockquote>Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="8">13 August
 1968</st1:date>, as heretofore stated, the CB Monetary Board adopted
Resolution No. 1333, ordering the Super­intendent of Banks to proceed to the
liquidation of the OBM, under Section 29 of the Central Bank Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already noted, implementation of this
resolution was restrained by this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners aver that no adequate financial assistance was granted
to the OBM after the execution of the Voting Trust Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further claim that the said agreement is
not only bilateral, im­posing reciprocal obligations for valuable
consideration, but was also entered into by respondent CB in the performance of
its duties under the law; and that under said agreement the obligation of the
CB was to act and work for the "rehabilitation, normalization and
stabilization" of the OBM, through the extension of adequate and necessary
financial assistance to stave off liquidation, is legally demandable, as well
as a duty specifically enjoined and imposed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And that in violation of
its obligations, the CB, "after eight months of delay", adopted the
questioned resolutions, without notice to or hearing the petitioners.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>By resolution of this Court, the respondents were required to
answer the petition and set for hearing the petition for a writ of
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on 13 August 1968,

the OBM from doing business and instructing the Superintendent of Banks to take

<blockquote>The CB stand is that to assail Resolution 1333 of the Monetary
Board ordering the liquidation of the Overseas Bank, an action must be filed in
the Court of First Instance of Manila by the Bank itself, and not by
petitioning stockholders, allegedly in view of the provi­sions of Section 29,
Republic Act No. 265, paragraph 3, reading:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"At any time within ten days after the Monetary Board has
taken charge of the assets of any banking institution, such institution may
apply to the Court of First Instance for an order requiring the Monetary Board
to show cause why it should not be enjoined from continuing such charge of its
assets, and the court may direct the Board to refrain from further proceedings
and to surrender charge of its assets."</p>

<blockquote>This argument must be rejected, for it overlooks the fact that
before the Central Bank adopted said Resolution No. 1333 on 13 August 1968 this
Court had already taken cognizance of the petition herein, assailing
Resolutions Nos. 1263 and 1290 of the Monetary Board as "patent acts of
liquidation", <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of its alleged
commitment to rehabilitate the Overseas Bank; and the Court, in fact, already
had required the Central Bank to answer the petition on 12 August 1962, prior
to the adoption of Resolution No. 1333.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter resolution is clearly an act in pursuance of the policy
outlined in the previous resolutions (1263 and 1290) enjoined by this Court hence,
if jurisdiction was already acquired to delve into the validity of Resolutions
1263 and 1290 (and this the Central Bank admits), there is no cogent reason
why, after such jurisdiction had been acquired, the Court should be deprived
thereof by the subsequent adoption of Resolution 1333, particularly because the
latter, in relation to the antecedent facts, appears to be no more than a
deliberate effort to evade the jurisdiction of this Court, and have the case
thrown back to the Court of First Instance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pegarum</span>, this Court quoted
with approval the rule that:</blockquote>

existing at the time it is invoked, and if the jurisdiction once attaches to
the person and subject matter of the litigation, the subsequent happening of
events, although they are of such a character as would have prevented
jurisdiction from attaching in the first instance, will not operate to oust
jurisdic­tion already attached."</p>

There is no denying that creditors, depositors and the banking community are

they can hardly be expected to resist the plans and actions of respondent

officer of the CB, the chief of its Department of Supervision and Examination
of all banking institutions operating in the country, subject to the
instructions of the Monetary Board at all times, pursuant to Section 25 of the
CB charter, Republic Act No. 265; and it is not credible that he should have
understood that he was entering into the trust agreement in his personal capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Bearing in mind that the communications, Annexes "B" and

to be construed against the party that caused them<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>,
the record becomes clear that, in consideration of the execution of the voting
trust agreement by the petitioner stockholders of OBM, and of the mortgage or
assignment of their personal properties to the CB (Res. No. 2015, 16 October
1967, Annex "F", Petition), the CB had agreed to announce its
readiness to support the new management "in order to allay the fears of
depositors and creditors" (Annex "B"), and to "stave off
liquidation" by providing adequate funds for "the rehabilitation,
normalization and stabilization" of the OBM, in a manner similar to what
the CB had previously done with the Republic Bank (Petition, Annex
"G", <u>ante</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While no
express terms in the documents refer to the provision of funds by CB for the
purpose, the same is necessarily implied, for in no other way could it
rehabilitate, normalize and stabilize a distressed bank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even in the absence of contract, the record plainly shows that the
CB made express representations to petitioners herein that it would support the
OBM, and avoid its liquidation if the petitioners would execute (a) the Voting
Trust Agreement turning over the management of OBM to the CB or its nominees,
and (b) mortgage or assign, their properties to the Central Bank to cover the
overdraft balance of OBM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners having complied with these condi­tions and parted with value to the
profit of the CB (which thus acquired additional security for its own
advances), the CB may not now renege on its representations and liquidate the
OBM, to the detriment of its stockholders, depositors and other creditors,

<p class="2Q">"The broad general rule to the effect that a promise to do or
not to do something in the future does not work an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
must be qualified, since there are numerous cases in which an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> has been predicated on promises or assurances as
to future conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of
'promissory <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>' is by no means new, although
the name has been adopted only in comparatively recent years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ac­cording to that doctrine, an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> may arise from the making of a promise, even
though without consi­deration, if it was intended that the promise should be
relied upon and in fact it was relied upon, and if a refusal to enforce it
would be virtually to sanction the perpetration of fraud or would result in
other injustice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this respect, the
reliance by the <span class="SpellE">promisee</span> is generally evidenced by
action or forbearance on his part, and the idea has been expressed that such action
or forbearance would reasonably have been expected by the <span class="SpellE">promisor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere omission by the <span class="SpellE">promisee</span>
to do whatever the <span class="SpellE">promisor</span> promised to do <span class="GramE">has</span> been held insufficient "forbearance" to give

<blockquote>Disingenuously, the CB pleaded that the Voting Trust agreement was
binding only upon the trustee, the Superintendent of Banks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as already pointed out, this position is
unacceptable since the trustee could have no private interest in the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that, but CB
subsequently caused its own team of nominees to take over the direction and
management of the OBM, through the voting of the shares conveyed to the
trustee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even more, in August, 1970, the
CB gave notice that it would not extend or renew the voting trust, and
attempted to turn back the shares covered by it to the petitioners, thereby
recognizing the ob­ligations under the agreement as its own, and repudiating
its original disclaimer thereof.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">All these points will greatly affect any projection.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.4in; text-indent: 0.2in;"><u>REQUEST</u>:</p>

<p class="2Q">That the PNB management team be withdrawn from TOBM.</p>

<blockquote>It is obvious from this memorandum that far from heeding the
request of its own team for an advance of P30 million (or P17 million in cash)
to enable the OBM to resume normal operations, the Central Bank did nothing to
support the OBM between 6 January to 14 June, for almost six months, and kept
even its own management team largely in the dark as to what to expect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 14 June, CB advised that only P10 million
were to be made available (i.e., one third of the require­ments estimated
necessary by its own representatives).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This amount was naturally considered insufficient to normalize, much
less re­habilitate, the OBM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet all
this while, the CB was holding peti­tioners' mortgages on their private
properties worth at least P67 million in 1967 by the CB's own appraisal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners claimed they were worth P100
million, which can not be very far from the truth, consi­dering the continual
rise in real estate values.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Not content with procrastinating for 6 months, without taking
positive steps to normalize OBM as it had agreed to do, nor even announcing its
support of its own management team or disclosing its policy regarding the
future of OBM, the CB finally adopted the resolu­tions now attacked by herein
petitioner stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="7">30 July 1968</st1:date>, it excluded the OBM
from clearing with the CB (<span class="SpellE">Resol</span>. <span class="GramE">No.

petitioners' private properties were to guard against.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="8"><span class="GramE">1 August 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, CB authorized (and virtually directed) its nominee Board of

1290); and thirteen days thereafter (<st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="8">13
 August 1968</st1:date>), the CB directed its Superintendent of Banks to
proceed to liquidate OBM (<span class="SpellE">Resol</span>. No. 1333) under
Section 29 of Re­public Act No. 265 (Central Bank Charter), providing that -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"SEC. 29.</span> <span class="GramE"><u>Proceedings
upon insolvency</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-­Whenever,
upon examination by the Superintendent or his examiners or agents into the
condition of any banking institution, it shall be disclosed that the condition
of the same is one of insolvency, or that its continuance in business would
involve probable loss to its depositors or creditors, it shall be the duty of
the Superintendent forthwith, in writing, to inform the Monetary Board of the
facts, and the Board, upon finding the statements of the Superintendent to be
true, shall forthwith forbid the institution to do business in the Philippines
and shall take charge of its assets and proceeds according to law.</p>

<p class="2Q">"If the Monetary Board shall determine that the banking
institution cannot resume business with safety to its creditors, it shall, by
the Solicitor General, file a petition in the Court of First Instance reciting
the proceedings which have been taken and praying the assistance and
supervision of the court in the liquidation of the affairs of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Superintendent shall thereafter, upon
order of the Monetary Board and under the supervision of the court and with all
convenient speed, convert the assets of the banking institution to money."</p>

<blockquote>We are constrained to agree with petitioners that the conduct of
the CB from and after January, 1968, reveals a calculated attempt to evade rehabilitating
OBM despite its promises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more
ag­gravating is that by the ordered liquidation, depositors and other creditors
would have to share in the assets of the OBM, while the CB's own credits for
advances were secured by the new mortgages it had obtained from the
petitioners, thereby gaining for it what amounts to an illegal preference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To cap it all, the CB disregarded its
representations and promises to rehabilitate and normalize the financial condition
of OBM, as it had previously done with the Re­public Bank, without even
offering to discharge the mortgages, given by petitioners in consideration for
its promises, or notifying peti­tioners that it desired to rescind its
contract, or bringing action in court for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And all the while CB knew that the situation
of the OBM was deteriorating daily, with penalties at 3% per month continually
accumulating, while its creditors, depositors and stock­holders awaited the
promised aid that never came, and which apparently CB never intended to give.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The deception practiced by the Central Bank, not only on peti­tioners
but on its own management team, was in violation of Articles 1159 and 1315 of
the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"ART. 1159<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="2Q">"ART. 1315<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contracts</span> are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the
parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly
stipulated but also to all the con­sequences which, according to their nature, <u>may
be in keeping with good faith</u>, usage and law." (Emphasis supplied)</p>

<blockquote>This Supreme Court expounded the import of these legal provisions
in <span class="SpellE">Abelarde</span> vs. Lopez, 74 Phil. 344, 348, stating:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">Cleverness should never take the place of
the loyal, upright and straightforward observance of plighted
undertakings."</p>

<blockquote>The CB excuses itself by pleading that the OBM officers had
resorted to non-recording of time deposits in the Bank's books and diverting
such deposits to accounts controlled by certain bank of­ficials, and other
irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to note,
however, that these "unrecorded" deposits were revealed to the CB as
early as <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="9">25 September 1967</st1:date>
by the then President of the OBM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr.
Martin <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, who had no hand in such irregularities
and who informed the Superintendent of Banks that time deposits worth P43<span class="GramE">,188,009.29</span> had not been carried in the books and had not
been reported to the OBM directors.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> In fact, on <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="9">29 September 1967</st1:date>, the CB had already ordered its
examiners to investigate the Bank's records and determine the parties
responsible.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a>
Notwithstanding knowledge of these irregularities, the CB did not withdraw its
promised support, and insisted on the execution of the Voting Trust Agreement
on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">20 Nov­ember 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such attitude imports that, in its opinion
the irregularities disclosed were not to be blamed on the OBM itself or its
depositors and creditors, but on the officials responsible; and further, that
the OBM could still be saved by adequate aid and management reform, which was
required by CB's duty to maintain the stability of the banking system and the
preservation of public confidence in it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent CB likewise urges in its defense that the rehabilitation
of the OBM has become impossible, and points out to the reports of the
Superintendent of Banks and of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Orosa</span> (the President of OBM elected by the CB nominees
under the Voting Trust) that the Bank's <span class="SpellE">loanable</span>
funds had to be expanded to P136 million to break even.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a> It
is to be borne in mind, however, that these reports were made in July, 1968,
after six months of inaction on the part of the CB, without positive action on
its part to comply with its previous commitments. Furthermore, while the
stabilization of the OBM required injections of capital, it would be erroneous
to assume that such capital would have to reach P130 million, or that it would
have to be advanced all at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For had
the CB furnished the original aid of 30 million asked by the <span class="SpellE">Orosa</span> team early in January, 1968, and the OBM allowed to
resume operations with CB support, the restored confidence would have stimu­lated
new deposits, which, as is well-known, become in turn a source of <span class="SpellE">loanable</span> funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
thus becomes apparent that most of the diffi­culties invoked now by the CB are
of its own making, and are not a lawful excuse for its refusal to comply with
its commitments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, in the
computations by the CB examiners, there are included a total of P16.994 million
for <u>estimated</u> losses, interests and penalties<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a>
that did not represent amounts to be disbursed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More concretely, even in July, 1968, after six months of CB
dilly-dallying, the actual amount needed to be loaned to the OBM for capital
requirements "to support the necessary expan­sion in risk assets of
P126.334 million in order to break even in its operations" was estimated
by the Superintendent of Banks at no more than P40.730 million.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a>
This amount tallies with Mr. A. <span class="SpellE">Orosa's</span> estimate that
an advance of P30 million in January, 1968 would have saved OBM.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a>
There is no showing that these amounts were beyond the capacity of CB to make<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>,
nor is it proved that they exceeded the amounts supplied for the rehabilitation
of the Republic Bank (the CB, for reasons of its own, refused to disclose the latter
amounts despite requests from the court).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cer­tainly, the ten million increase in advance capital requirements
between January and July of 1968 can not be blamed on the petitioners herein,
and was not of their own making.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondent CB cites American cases to the effect that the
courts can not interfere with CB's discretion in determining whether or not a
distressed bank should be supported or liquidated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In none of the cases cited, however, does it
appear that the CB engaged to support the distressed bank in exchange for
control of its management and additional mortgages its favor, and, therefore,
the authorities cited are not in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Discretion has its limits and has never been held to include arbitrariness,
discrimination or bad faith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We conclude that having induced the petitioners to part with ad­ditional
security in reliance upon its (CB's) promises and commitments to avert
liquidation and to support, normalize and rehabilitate the OBM, the respondent
CB is duty bound to comply in good faith with such promises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, being contrary thereto, CB
Resolutions Nos. 1263, 1290 and 1333 should be annulled and set aside for
having been adopted in abuse of discretion, equivalent to excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And never having attempted to comply, <span class="GramE">nor</span> even to begin compliance, with its commitments and
promises, the respondent CB is precluded to invoke the expiration of the period
specified for the duration of its obligations under the Voting Trust
Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such period should, in
justice and equity, be deemed to start running from and after the CB begins due
performance of its commitments, promises and represen­tations in good faith.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKALINTAL, <i>J.</i>:<u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I fail to see, either from the record of this case or from the
opinion of the majority, just how and where respondent Central Bank acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion so as to
justify the <span style="">writs </span>of certiorari
and prohibition granted by this Court; and just how and where said respondent
neglected to perform a duty specifically enjoined by law so as to justify the
writ of mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind the acts
complained of in the <span style="">petition, namely, </span>Resolutions
Nos. 1263 and 1290, passed <span style="">by the
Monetary Board on </span>July 31 and August 1, 1968, <span style="">respectively, were, </span>if anything, a judicious exercise of
discretion for the purpose of carrying out the policies laid down by the
Central Bank Act with respect to supervision over the operation of private
banking institutions; and this Court, by issuing the writs prayed for, has
substituted its own judgment for that of the Monetary Board in a matter that is
peculiarly within the competence of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the decision, as far as I can make out, is that the
Voting Trust Agreement of <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1967</st1:date> created contractual obligations, with which "res­pondent
Central Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> is </span>directed
to comply..." The directive does not specify what those <span style="">obligations are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The principal <span style="">stipulation </span>in the agree­ment is simply what its <span style="">title indicates:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petitioners </span>here, <span style="">referred </span>to as the <u><span style="">Cestuis</span></u><span style=""> <u>Que</u> </span><u><span style="">Trust</span></u><span style="">, assign </span>to the Trustee "for such purpose" <span style="">the </span><span style="">voting rights </span>to all their shares of
stock in the <span style="">Overseas Bank </span>of <st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span>subject to
certain conditions thereafter stated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose <span style="">envisaged </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">expressed in the
first of the two "WHEREAS" clauses of the agreement, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"the abovenamed stock­holders
(petitioners here) believe that it is </span>for and/or in the <span style="">interest </span>and
<span style="">benefit </span>of
the bank's <span style="">depositors,
</span>creditors and stockholders that this <span style="">trust agreement </span>should be <span style="">entered </span>into
by them for the <span style="">rehabilitation, </span>normalization and stabilization of the <span style="">Overseas </span>Bank
of Manila."</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems, from a <span style="">reading </span>of the decision of this Court, that
the purpose for which <span style="">the Voting Trust </span>Agreement was <span style="">entered </span>into - more accurately, the
goal sought to be achieved - is mistaken for the obligation thereunder, and
that such obligation devolves not upon the Trustee, the Superintendent of
Banks, but upon the Central Bank itself, which is not a party to the agree­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that <span style="">as </span>it may, the agreement contains an
optional rescission clause, which <span style="">is
only logical, since </span><span style="">the feasibility </span>of rehabilitating, normalizing and stabilizing the
Overseas Bank, which was then in extreme­ly distressed circumstances, would
depend upon many factors which could not be predicted with mathematical
certitude, but only upon a reasonably considered projection of future
probabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus while the life of
the agreement would be for three years from the date of its execution, it was
provided expressly "that the Trustee may, at its option, relinquish the
trust, upon approval of the Monetary Board."</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolution No. 1263, adopted <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1968</st1:date>, excluded the Overseas Bank, then under
trusteeship, from clearing with the Central Bank, effective immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolution No. 1290, adopted the next day,
granted authority to the Board of Directors of the Overseas Bank to suspend
opera­tions pending final action by the Monetary Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such final action was evidently meant to be
in connection with the recommendation submitted by the <span style="">Superintendent of </span>Banks to the Monetary Board on <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1968</st1:date>, which reads in part <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"After considering (1) the Ex­aminers' provisions for
estimated losses on the recorded loans and re­ceivables of P13.766 million
(exclusive of estimated losses of P13.243 million on 'unrecorded' loans and
receivables), plus 2(a) the accrued interest on the emergency loans by, and
overdrawings with, the Central Bank, and 2(b) penal­ties payable on deposit <span style="">reserve de­ficiencies aggregating </span>P3.228
million, or <span style="">a
</span>total of P16.994 million, all of these not yet taken up in the books,
the bank's capital accounts per books of P14.356 million as of June 30, 1968,
would be wiped out resulting in an estimated deficiency to credi­tors of P2.638
million.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the minimum capital
required under Sec­tion 22 of Republic Act No. 337 as of June 30, 1968 is
P19.142 million, the amount of fresh capital needed to be put up to <span style="">comply with the minimum capital </span>requirement
as of June 30, 1968 would be P21.780 million.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, P18.950 million of new capital must be put up by the Bank
to support the necessary expansion in risk assets of P126.334 million in order
to break even in its operations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the total fresh capital which the Bank must put up to meet
the requirements of Section 22 of R.A. No. 337, after considering the estimated
losses on loans and other expenses not yet taken up in the books, as well as
the necessary expansion in risk assets so as to break even in its operations,
would be P40.730 million.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the capital structure cannot be strengthened to meet the
requirements of Section 22 of R.A. No. 337, and massive financing cannot be
given to enable the Bank to expand its risk as­sets to the level at which it
can break even in operations, then there seems to be no other alternative
except to liquidate the Bank under Section 29 of R.A. No. 265.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bank's continuance in business under its
present extremely precarious financial condition, with­out the necessary
capital injection and financial aid, will involve not merely probable, but
certain, further losses to its depositors and other creditors and may have
further adverse effects on the banking system."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the situation depicted by the Superintendent of Banks, which
in his opinion presented no other alterna­tive except to liquidate the Overseas
Bank pursuant to Section 29 of Republic Act No. 265 (Charter of the Central
Bank), the adoption of Resolutions Nos. 1263 and 1290 was not, in my opinion, a
violation of the Voting Trust Agree­ment, much less an abuse of discretion on
the part of the Monetary Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a sense the issue with respect to the afore­said resolutions
has become moot and academic in view of the fact that on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1968</st1:date>, after the instant pe­tition was
filed, the Monetary Board adopted Resolution No. 1333, wherein it decided as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">To</span> forbid the
Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> to do
business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To instruct the Superintendent of Banks to
take charge, in the name of the Monetary Board of the bank's assets;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To instruct the Superintendent of Banks to
take such further action as may be necessary pursuant to Section 29 of Republic
Act No. 265; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To refer the said memorandum report of the
Superintendent of Banks as well as previous pertinent reports of the examiners
of the Department of Supervision and Examination, particularly those pertaining
to unrecorded certificates of time deposits bearing the signatures of former
officers of the bank, to the Central Bank Legal Counsel for appropriate legal
action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The adoption of Resolution No. 1333, it seems to me, should
remove the present controversy from this Court - if it was properly here at all
in the first place, which I doubt - and address it to the Court of First
Instance pursuant to Section 29 of the Central Bank Charter, which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 29.</span> <span class="GramE">Proceeding
upon in­solvency.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Whenever,
upon examination by the Superintendent or his examiners or agents into the
condition of any banking institution, it shall <span style="">be </span>dis­closed that the condition of
the same is one of insolvency, or that its continuance in business would
involve probable loss to its depositors or creditors, it shall be the duty of
the Superintendent forthwith, in writing, to inform the Monetary Board of the
facts, and the Board, upon finding the statements of the Superintendent to be
true, shall forthwith forbid the institution to do business in the Philippines
and shall take charge of its assets and proceeds according to law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Monetary Board shall there­upon determine within thirty days
whether the institution may be reorganized or otherwise placed in such a con­dition
so that it may be permitted to <span style="">resume
business with safety to its creditors and shall prescribe the con­ditions under
which such resumption of business shall take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such case the expenses and fees in the
adminis­tration of the institution shall be determined by the Board and shall
be paid to the Central Bank out of the assets of such banking institution.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At any time within ten days after the Monetary Board has taken
charge of the assets of any banking institution, such institution may apply to
the Court of First Instance for an order requiring the Monetary Board to show
cause why it should not be enjoined from continuing such charge of its assets,
and the court may direct the Board to refrain from further pro­ceedings and to
surrender charge of its assets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the Monetary Board shall determine that the banking institution
cannot resume business with safety to its creditors, it shall, by the Solicitor
General, file a petition in the Court of First Instance reciting the pro­ceedings
which have been taken and pray­ing the assistance and supervision of the court
in the liquidation of the affairs of the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Superintendent shall thereafter, upon order of the Monetary Board
and under the supervision <span style="">of the court
and with all convenient speed, convert the assets of the banking institution to
money."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">My misgiving as to the
propriety of the remedy sought by petitioners </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that it is essentially for the enforcement of
an alleged contract, presented in the guise of a petition for certiorari,
prohibition and mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">borne out by the
decision of this Court, which directs the Central Bank "to comply with its
ob­ligations under the Voting Trust Agreement, and to desist from taking any
action in violation thereof." It is to be noted that no "act which
the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or
station" </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">ordered to be performed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Compliance with contractual obli­gations is beyond the purview of
mandamus, and original jurisdiction over an action for that purpose pertains to
the Courts of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
action is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law which,
being available to petitioners, should bar the present recourse to the extraordinary
writ of mandamus, especially because certain vital facts are controverted by
the parties, such as the outstanding liabilities which can not be paid by the
Overseas Bank, the value of the properties mortgaged to the Central Bank by
petitioners, the extent of the loans secured by the mortgage, and the amount of
money which the Central Bank is supposed to advance in order to comply with its
supposed undertaking to rehabilitate, normalize and stabilize the Overseas
Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curiously enough, <span style="">as </span>already noted, the decision of
this Court merely directs compliance with the Voting Trust Agreement without
specifying - if indeed what is implied is the rehabilitation of the Overseas
Bank - just what should be done to achieve that goal, or just how many millions
of pesos the Central Bank must continue to pump into the Overseas Bank in order
to put it on its feet again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no
idle speculation to say that the writs granted by this Court may raise more
questions than they answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With particular reference
to the mortgages executed by petitioners, they say the same were a
consideration of the Voting Trust Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Central Bank denies this and maintains that the mortgages
were constituted as security for "the huge amounts of emergency loans and
overdrawings advanced in the clearing house to the OBM by the Central
Bank." The Voting Trust Agreement itself is silent on the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My own reading of the record convinces me of
the correctness of the position of the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, considering the existence of a
substantial disagreement on this point, not only between the parties but also
among the members of this Court, the issue could best be resolved in an
ordinary action, either for specific performance as hereinbefore indicated or
for rescission of the mortgages and the re-conveyance of the mortgaged
properties to petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
resolution of this issue I believe that this Court is not the proper forum in
the first instance, <span class="GramE">nor</span> the present petition the
proper vehicle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Going back to Section 29
of Republic Act No. 265, it may be noted that what the Central Bank did,
including its suggestion that a Voting Trust Agreement be executed, was in
accordance with its powers and duties under the said section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever a banking institution is in a state
of insolvency the Monetary Board shall determine whether it "may be
reorganized or otherwise placed in such a condition so that it may be permitted
to <span class="GramE">resume</span> business with safety." A Voting Trust,
such as that which </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">entered into in the
case of the Overseas Bank, is certainly one of the measures which may be
adopted for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rehabilita­tion
of the distressed institution is the primary goal of the authority given to the
Monetary Board, and there is nothing so sacrosanct in a voting trust agreement,
or in the use of the word "rehabilitate" therein, that once it is
executed the Central Bank is thereby bound to see the
"rehabilitation" through as an ordinary con­tractual commitment, no
matter how costly and impractical it may prove. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>For Section 29 also provides that "if the
Monetary Board shall determine that the banking ins­titution cannot resume
business with safety to its creditors, it shall, by the Solicitor General, file
a petition in the Court of First Instance reciting the pro­ceedings which have
been taken and praying the assistance and supervision of the Court in the
liquidation of the affairs of the same." This was precisely the step con­templated
by the Monetary Board when it passed Resolution No. 1333 on August 1968, and any
questions concerning its validity, in my opinion, should be raised in a proper
case as authorized in the said provision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the foregoing
considerations, I vote to deny the writs prayed for and to dismiss the instant
petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
