<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> corporation, in compliance with the decision,
submitted, on 24 February 1966, a detailed statement to support its claim for
P37,236.00 and, on 1 March 1966, the excepts from its amended by-laws and from
the minutes of the meeting or its<span style="">&nbsp; </span>board
electing Mr. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Binamira</span> as vice-president and
confirming his designation as general manager, instead of the board resolution
authorizing Mr. <span class="SpellE">Binamira</span> to execute the power of
attorney in favor of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Elevado</span>,
as the latter had promised to present to the court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3 March 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, defendant-appellant Aida <span class="SpellE">Abastillas</span>
received a copy of the decision (Record, page 2), and on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">10 March 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> filed a motion to declare plaintiff corporation
non-suited for its failure to appear in the pre-trial because the power of
attorney of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elevado</span> to represent the corporation
was invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">12 March 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="5"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">12 May 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, defendant-appellant filed a petition set aside judgment, which was
denied in an order dated </span><st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="5"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">14 May 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same order, defendant was ordered
"either to except - - - submitting the basis for the exception; or to
accept plaintiff's claim that she is indebted to plaintiff in the sum of P37<span class="GramE">,236.00</span> . . . . . .” Defendant-appellant moved to
reconsider, but her motion was denied on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">4 June 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hence
defendant-appellant interposed the present appeal from the order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="5"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">14 May 1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> denying her petition to set aside judgment, including the portion of
the order ordering her to except or accept plaintiff claim in the sum of P37<span class="GramE">,236.00</span>, and from the order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">4
 June 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> denying reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Appellant's
theory is that the by-laws of plaintiff corporation did not empower its
vice-president and general manager to execute the power of attorney in favor of
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elevado</span> to represent said corporation in the
pre-trial; that since Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elevado</span> lacked the
authority to represent the corporation, the corporation was, therefore, absent
during the pre-trial, and for such absence, it should have been non-suited, under
Section 2, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">‘'SEC. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Failure to appear at pre-trial conference</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- A party who fails to appear at a pre-trial
conference may be non-suited or considered as in default."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Appellant adds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the submission
by plaintiff of the excerpts from the bylaws of the corporation and from the
minutes of the board meeting electing Mr. <span class="SpellE">Binamira</span> as
vice president and confirming his designation as general manager is not a
sufficient compliance with the condition provided for in the compromise
judgment, which called for the board solution authorizing Mr. <span class="SpellE">Binamira</span> to execute the power of attorney, not the said
excerpts; and that although the general manager has power to execute contracts
binding upon the corporation, such power refers only to the business of trading
merchandise and not to the “business of litigation at law” (per Reply Brief,
page 12).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It does
not appear from the "Terms of Settlement" that the matter of
corporate representation in the pre-trial was a consideration - - - - much less
the controlling consideration - - - - that impelled the parties to enter into
the said settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant,
therefore, cannot claim that she would not have entered into the agreement had
she known that accountant <span class="SpellE">Elevado</span> had no authority to
represent the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her ground of
fraud in her petition to set aside judgment is no fraud at all; she was not
deceived into giving her consent to the agreement; the power of attorney was
presented at the pre-trial conference (Record, page 107) and not kept off from
her notice, or suppressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has not
even alleged any prejudice, outside of the terms of the settlement, that
accrued to her by reason of the supposed lack of authority of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elevado</span> on the contrary, her bringing up the matter of
corporate representation after she had consented to the agreement, has delayed,
by a technicality, the satisfaction of them judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could have withheld her consent had she
been serous in her belief that the power of attorney was invalid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Appellant's
admission that the general manager has authority to execute contracts of
trading binding upon the company (Reply Brief, page 12) implies, incidentally,
if not necessarily, his power to seek judicial redress for non-fulfillment or
breach of such contracts by parties with whom said general manager has
contracted in behalf of the company, such as the present appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the
power can not be delegated, the plaintiff corporation's act in sub­mitting the
detailed statement of account called for in the compromise and decision
constitutes an adoption and ratification of the compromise and a validation of
accountant <span class="SpellE">Elevado's</span> act in entering the same,
thereby curing whatever defect in authority existed heretofore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The trial
judge has the discretion to declare a party non-suited (American Insurance Co.
vs. Republic, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-25478, </span></span><st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="10"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">23 October 1967</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, 21; SCRA
464; Home Insurance Co. v. U. S. Lines Co., G.R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> L-25593, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="11"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">15 November 1967</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, 21 SCRA 863), and, in this case, in view of the
circumstances, he did not abuse such discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But, if
for one reason alone, the appellant's petition to set aside judgment was
properly denied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the petition was filed
late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She received a copy of the
decision on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3 March 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> and filed her petition on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="5"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">12 May 1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3, Rule 38, of the
Rules of Court provides that such petition should be filed "within sixty
(60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, order, or other
proceeding to be set aside, and not more than six (6) months after such judgment
or order was entered, or such proceeding was taken .........” Despite her
having filed her petition within six (6) months, such time of filing did not
satisfy the period of limitation because the filing was not made within sixty
(60) days after she learned of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second period mentioned in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
rule is a limitation to the first (2 Moran 222, and cases cited therein).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">FOR
THE FOREGOING REASONS</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, appealed orders are hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Treble costs in instance personally against counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
