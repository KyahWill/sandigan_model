the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
dismissing the appeal of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">defendant for its failure to pay in full the
appellate court's docket fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of Appeals certified this case to us for final determination for the reason
that then question in足volved is one of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="7"><span style="">July 18,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the plaintiff
instituted an action for damages against the defendant in the Justice of the P</span><span style="">eace </span><span style="">Court (now Municipal Court) of <span class="SpellE">M<span style="">ati</span></span></span><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After trial judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the
defendant, ordering the latter to pay </span><span style="">the former the sums </span><span style="">of P1<span class="GramE">,036.49</span> as
actual damages and P300.00 as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notice of the judgment was received by counsel for the defendant on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="10"><span style="">October
 25, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day the defendant filed with the Justice
of the Peace Court </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">notice of appeal to the Court of First
Instance, with the appeal bond of P25.00 in the form of cash deposit with the
Municipal Treasurer, and a postal money order for P12.00 payable to the clerk
of the </span><span style="">Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> for the appellate court docket fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Justice of the Peace then transmitted the
record of the case to the clerk of the Court of First Instance, who
acknowledged receipt thereof in a notice dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November 10, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two days after the
expiration of the fifteen day period within which to perfect the appeal the
plaintiff moved to dismiss the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">on the ground of failure to pay in full the
docket fee which, in accordance with Rule 130, Section 5 of the Rules of Court
(old) should be P32.00 instead of P12.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In an order dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="11"><span style="">November 17, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon the defendant moved to
reconsider, but was turned down in an order dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="12"><span style="">December 22, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
only issue here </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">whether or not the appeal to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> was perfected in ac足</span><span style="">cordance </span><span style="">with Rule 40, Section 2</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the Rules of
Court (old), </span><span style="">notwithstanding the
failure to pay in full the appellate court docket fee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant contends that
the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> should have allowed the appeal as there was
substantial compliance with the Rules of Court, the deficiency in the amount
paid for docket fee being a technical defect which could be cured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant maintains that the rules on
procedure should be construed liberally so as not to deprive it of the right to
appeal on mere technicality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
it claims good faith and lack of intention to disregard the Rules and explains
that the deficiency of P20.00 in the docket fee was due to an honest mistake in
computation on the part of counsel, he being </span><span style="">a new </span><span style="">practitioner who was then appealing a civil
case for the first time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had that
counsel, upon realizing his mistake and without having been asked to do so by
the clerk of the Court of First Instance, purchased <span style="">a </span>postal money order for P20.00 on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="11"><span style="">November 16, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, with the intention of remitting the same to
cover the shortage in the docket fee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
rule is settled that, in case of appeals from inferior courts to the Courts of
First Instance, the amount of the appellate court docket fee should be deposited
in full within a period of fifteen days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, if half only of the amount is deposited and the other half is
tendered after the expiration of such period, the appeal is not deemed
perfected.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> True, in several
instances this Court has re足laxed the rule and then allowed the appeal in order
to pre足vent a miscarriage of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For instance, where the appellants were from the very beginning ready
and willing to pay the correct amount of docket fee and the failure to do so
was caused by the mistake of either the clerk of the Court of First Instance</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or the clerk of
the justice of </span><span style="">the peace court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or of the justice </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the peace and the
municipal treasurer,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or of the municipal treasurer alone,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court held that it would be unjust to
dismiss the appeal under the circumstances because:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Every citizen has the right to assume and trust that a public
officer charged by law with certain duties knows his duties and performs them
in accordance with <span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>To penalize such a
citizen for relying upon said officer in all good faith is repugnant to
justice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the instant </span><span style="">case, </span><span style="">however, the
failure of the appellant to pay the full amount of appellate court docket fee
was due to the inexcusable negligence of Atty. Antonio</span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span>, its
counsel in the Justice of the Peace Court, if not indeed to his ignorance of
the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanation that such
failure was caused by an honest mistake of said counsel in the computation of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">amount required is
not credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Rule 30, Section 5
of the Rules of Court (old), no computation was necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the amount of P12.00 which was
actually paid was below the statutory minimum of P16.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, said counsel did not refer to the
Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he was a new
practitioner did not justify his negligence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If anything, it should have made him more careful in the handling of his
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the
dismissal of the appeal does not constitute a reversible error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
