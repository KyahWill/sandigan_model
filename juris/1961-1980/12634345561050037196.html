for having carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years of age, against her will,
with the use of a deadly weapon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the offended party, Antonia (Anita) Solano,
who was born on <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1958</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
was serving as a housemaid in the house of the accused, Felipe Morales, in
order to pay off a debt incurred by her parents with said Felipe Morales.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused is married to Isabel <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span> and the
spouses have four (4) children whose ages are 16, 15, 11, and 7 years.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
They live in a secluded and forested area in <span class="SpellE">Nanganangan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dumalinao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, a barrio very far from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
and the highway, and where their nearest neighbor lived half a kilometer away.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of March 10, 1970, while the household was asleep,
Felipe Morales told Antonia Solano, who was sleeping by herself in another part
of the <span class="SpellE">unpartitioned</span> house, "to wake up because
he would make a sexual intercourse" with her.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, the accused got his bolo and, pointing it at the chest of the girl near
her neck, told her that if she would not consent, he would kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pulled down her panty and placed himself
on top of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">She </span>struggled to get up, but Felipe Morales held her down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could not shout because she was afraid
that the accused would kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused inserted his penis into her genitalia and had sexual intercourse with
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt pain and blood came out of
her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to rouse the
15-year old daughter of the accused who was sleeping near her, saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mar, you wake up because your father is
raping me." But, Mar did not wake up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She merely moved.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Felipe Morales had sexual intercourse with her five (5) times that night.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, she went home and reported the in­cident to
her parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, they did not believe
her.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
How­ever, she stayed in their house and did not return to the house of Felipe
Morales until "Felipe Morales went to our house and he told my parents
that if they will not allow me to return to the house of Felipe Morales, the
accused will kill all of us."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
So, she went back to the house of Felipe Morales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also reported the incident to the wife of
Felipe Morales, but "she did not mind."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

three times every night.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Felipe Morales and his son took Antonia Solano with them to <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span>,
to sell rattan and to buy some provisions in the market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding an opportunity, Antonia Solano

</p>

<p class="BODY">Felipe Morales admitted that he had carnal knowledge of Antonia
Solano on the occasions mentioned by her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He claims, however, that it was with the consent of the woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that on <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1970</st1:date>, he and his common-law wife, Isabel <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>, went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sanoy</span>, where the parents of Antonia Solano were then
residing, in order to propose and make arrangements for his marriage to
Antonia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among those present, other than
the parents of Antonia and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sanoy</span>, were <span class="SpellE">Pacio</span> and the son of <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span>, whose family names he could not recall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia was also present, but was asleep in
another part of the house when they arrived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, she was awakened and she consented to her marriage with Felipe
Morales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felipe Morales was required to
give a dowry of P200.00 and one and a half (1-1/2) hectares of land to the
parents of Antonia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, he was only
able to give P62.00 and still lacks P138.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also agreed to have the marriage celebrated the next year because
the priest might not consent as Antonia was still young.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1970</st1:date>,
he invited Antonia and her parents to his house to participate in a
prayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came and stayed in their
house that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia slept with her
parents while his wife slept beside her sister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He slept beside Antonia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As
a matter of fact, it was her parents who said that 'why is it that you are far
from each other, anyway what is lacking is only the marriage ceremony.'"
So, he and Antonia rolled inside a mat and had sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia was a virgin and, in the beginning,
he found it difficult to insert his penis into her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia did not resist and enjoyed the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"She even go on top of me." He had
sexual intercourse with Antonia five (5) times that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and Antonia were "as sweet as
honey" and had sexual intercourse 2 to 3 times every night until <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He does not know why Antonia filed a
complaint against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected the defense and found that the accused
Felipe Morales did in fact commit the crime of rape on the person of Antonia
Solano, who at the time of the intercourse was only 11 years and 7 months old,
and that the marriage pro­posal of Morales was a last-ditch effort to make
Antonia Solano withdraw her charge of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the records of the case with great care and find
no reason to disturb the findings of fact of the trial court based upon
credibility of witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the manner
the complainant had testified in court, there could be no doubt that she was
telling the absolute truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard
to conceive that she would claim and admit the ignominy and shame she had gone
through if they were not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
also fully convinced that the allegations of rape have been proven beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
the offended party recited in full the details of how the accused did
everything in his power to overcome her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence of force indicates that the accused had carnal knowledge of
her after pointing a bolo at her chest, near the neck, and telling her that he
would kill her if she did not accede to his demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused pinned her down and though she
tried to get up, he proved much stronger.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She could not shout as she was afraid that he would kill her if she
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony is corroborated by
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bernarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalid</span> who
examined her and found signs of violation of her person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One other circumstance which supports the
claim that rape was committed is the fact that the day following the commission
of the felony, the complainant went home and reported the incident to her
parents and refused to return to the house of the accused, until the latter
threatened to kill all of them if she did not return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another circumstance indicative of his guilt is
the fact that the accused proposed marriage to Antonia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia Solano declared that the accused had,
indeed, proposed marriage to her, but that it was made after he had raped her
and she did not agree to the proposal "because he has wife and so many
children and he even raped me and I am still young."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
And <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sanoy</span>, a
friend of the accused, who was presented to corroborate the statement of the
accused that he had proposed marriage, stated that he cannot understand why the
accused should propose marriage "because I know that Felipe Morales is a
married man" and has four children.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
He did not ask Felipe Morales the reason why he was proposing marriage
"because if I will ask he might get angry."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
He was also ashamed and did not like to interfere.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused, who had already a wife and children some of whom are even older
than the complainant, would not have offered to marry her except out of a sense
of guilt and in order to avoid criminal responsibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not oblivious to the efforts made by counsel for the
accused to discredit the testimony of the complainant in point­ing out some
discrepancies or flaws in the testimony of the com­plainant concerning the
manner she was forced into submission by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But said flaws or discrepancies cannot de­value
the substance of her testimony or destroy the other cir­cumstances that point
unerringly to the defendant's guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, We have to consider her situation as a girl of tender age whose
will had been subjugated, accompanied by threats of death, and the fact that
the felony was committed almost two years before she gave her testimony in
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the defendant that it was the parents of the
complainant who proposed that the accused should have sexual intercourse with
the offended party without the benefit of clergy is very incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that accused is a married man with
four children was known to the parents of the com­plainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if they consented that their daughter be
a second wife to the accused, still it is unbelievable for the parents of the
girl to have proposed and openly and willingly allowed their daughter to have
sexual intercourse with the accused, before marriage, and in the presence of
several persons, including the wife of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, if it were true, as the defense alleges, that the complainant
had agreed to marry the accused and have sexual intercourse with him and that
their connubial relation­ship was "as sweet as honey", it is
incomprehensible for the complainant to have escaped from the accused at the
first opportunity and later denounce him for committing such a beastly and
shameful crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the extreme
modesty and timidity of the Filipino women, especially those from the barrio,
We cannot believe that the herein offended party, whose chastity has not been
questioned, could have fabricated such a story as would so seriously dishonor
her.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, even granting that she had consented to the inter­course,
this fact does not relieve the accused of criminal responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the offended party was less than 12
years old at the time of the intercourse, rape was committed although there
might have been consent to the sexual act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being of tender age, she is presumed not to have a will of her own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not consider any kind of consent
given by her as voluntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused assails the decision of the trial court, claim­ing
that the prosecution failed to introduce evidence, whether documentary or
testimonial, to support the claim of the offended party that she was under 12
years of age at the time of the com­mission of the felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia Solano declared that she was born on <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1958</st1:date> so that she was only
11 years and 7 months old on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="3">March 10,
 1970</st1:date> when the accused had carnal knowledge of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is admitted by the accused in his
sworn statement,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
given soon after his arrest, wherein he stated the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know how old Anita <span class="SpellE">Sullano</span> is?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What I know of her age, is running 12 years
old."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The fact is further corroborated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bernarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalid</span> who, upon
examining the offended party, stated that the complainant was "A(n) 11
years 9 months old child, slightly pale looking brought by the policeman."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the age of the complainant has not been <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of
proof to the contrary, her testimony should be accepted as the truth, as found
by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be true that the complaint and the information stated that
the complainant was 12 years old.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, as contended by the Solicitor General, "the allegations in
the com­plaint or information do not control over the proof submitted regarding
the date of birth of the complainant, which proof, the defense did not
controvert in any way during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Be­sides, the information is technically correct, because when it was filed
on <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1970</st1:date>, the
complainant was then actually 12 years of age, her 12th birthday having been <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1970</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused also claims that the sexual intercourse between the
accused and the complainant could not have been consummated other than through
mutual agreement and performed with utmost secrecy and surreptitiousness since
the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of his house, which is only 3 x 3 meters in
dimension, is used at the same time as the sleeping quarters of his entire
family consisting of himself, his wife, and four children whose ages were 16,
15, 11, and 7 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Seemingly, it would be improbable for the accused to have raped
the complainant under those circumstances and in the presence of his wife and
children, but a man overcome by his perversity and beastly passions chooses
neither time, nor place, nor victim, and forgets everything to satisfy his
passion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, as stated in the
medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A") the accused
would have sexual intercourse with the complainant "even against the will and
consent of the wife."</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the accused contends that the claim of the com­plainant
during the trial that she was threatened with a bolo is a "wild figment of
her malevolent imagination" since her complaint, affidavit, and the
"searching questions and answers" conducted by Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dalid</span> do not mention anything about her having been
threatened by the accused with a bolo, and, there­fore, deserves no credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The medical certificate (Exhibit "A") shows that the complainant
had already mentioned the bolo as the intimidating force in the commission of
rape against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said certificate
states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"According to the child,
she could not escape because there is a bolo beside them while sleeping and it
is hard to escape because the place is yet a forest." At any rate, the
fact that the affidavit of the offended party in support of the complaint and
information are less de­tailed than her testimony in open court does not, make
said affidavit or testimony false or incredible, there being no in­congruity
between them or inconsistency in the facts stated in one and the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither the rules nor practice require
detailed affidavits in support of a complaint or information.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that the aggravating circumstances of
nighttime, dwelling and abuse of confidence attended the commission of the
felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nighttime, however, is not
aggravating since the record does not show that it was sought after to
facilitate the attainment of the lustful purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dwelling cannot also be appreciated as an
aggravating circumstance because the accused and the offended party are
domiciled in the same house where the felony was committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
But abuse of confidence is present since the complainant was a housemaid of the
accused when the crime was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty to be
imposed is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death
when the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the felony was committed with the use
of a deadly weapon and at­tended by the aggravating circumstance of abuse of
confidence, with no mitigating circumstance to offset the same, the penalty
should be imposed in its maximum period, which is death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, therefore, correctly
sentenced the accused to suffer the death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommends that the accused should be
ordered to indemnify the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been raped is
akin to suffering moral death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the offended party should be indemnified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the trial court is hereby
affirmed with the modification that the accused Felipe Morales is ordered to
indemnify the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonia
Solano, the amount of P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
costs against the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, for lack of the required number of votes, for the
imposition of the death penalty, the accused Felipe Morales is hereby sentenced
to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.</p>
