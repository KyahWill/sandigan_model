<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears, however, that
since 1952, petitioner had been protesting the imposition of the sales tax on
its </span><st1:place><span style="">APO</span></st1:place><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">portland</span> cement,
and on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="1"><span style="">January 16, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, it also protested the payment of <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Without awaiting
respondent's ruling on said claims for refund, petitioner, on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="1"><span style="">January
 24, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, filed with
the Court of Tax Appeals a petition for re­view "of the action of the
Collector of Internal Reve­nue in refusing to entertain petitioner's claim for
re­fund of the percentage tax on sales of its </span><st1:place><span style="">APO</span></st1:place><span style=""> cement." It was alleged in the petition
that the percentage taxes collected by respondent are refundable since un­der
Republic Act 1299, producers of cement are exempt from the payment of said
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was amended on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="10"><span style="">October
 24, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, and again
amended on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, to include </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">claim for refund of <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
taxes alleged to have been overpaid through double payments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After hearing and
consideration of the evidence submitted in connection therewith, the Court of
Tax Appeals rendered judgment dismissing the petition for review, holding:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that petitioner was not exempt from
payment of the sales taxes on its APO <span class="SpellE">portland</span> cement
prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No. 1299, it
being then considered a manufactured product; (2) that petitioner is not
entitled to deduction from the gross selling price of the cost of raw
materials, the value of the bag containers and gypsum in the absence of
evidence that they had been previously subjected to the 7% tax imposed by
sections 186 and 190 of the Tax Code; (3) that for so much of the sales taxes
that were billed, charged to, and paid for by its cus­tomers, the petitioner is
not the proper party to claim for refund; and (4) that the right to claim for
refund of taxes alleged to have been erroneously paid thru wrong computation,
double payment, or otherwise, is already barred by prescription.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dissatisfied with the
findings of the Tax Court, the petitioner elevated the case to the Supreme
Court on a petition for review of the decision, assigning as errors the
conclusions as above enumerated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first assigned error
calls for a ruling on the prospective or retrospective application of Republic
Act No. 1299, which became effective upon its approval on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="16" month="6"><span style="">June 16,
 1955</span></st1:date><span style="">, amending
section 246 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">"SEC. 246.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DEFINITIONS OF THE TERMS "GROSS OUTPUT",
"MINERALS" AND" MINERAL PRODUCTS" - DISPOSITION OF
ROYALTIES AND AD VALOREM TAXES. -The term "gross output" shall be
interpreted as the actual market value <span style="">of
minerals or products, or of bul­lion from each mine or mineral pro­ducts, or of
bullion from each mine or mineral lands operated as a separate entity without
any deduction from mining, milling, refining, transporting handling, marketing,
or any other expenses: Provided, How­ever, That if the minerals or mineral
products are sold or consigned abroad by the lessee or owner of the mine under
C.K.F. terms, the actual cost of ocean freight and insurance shall be deducted.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>The output of any group of contiguous
mining claims shall not be subdivided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The word, "Minerals" shall mean all inorganic substances found
in nature whether in solid, liquid, gaseous, or any intermediate state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term "Mineral products" shall
mean things produced by the lessee, concessionaire or owner of mineral lands,
at least eighty per cent of which things must be minerals extracted by such
lessee, concessionaire, or owner of mineral lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten per centum of the royalties and ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> taxes herein provided shall accrue to the
municipality and ten per centum to the province where the mines are situated,
and eighty per centum to the national treasury."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
only change brought about by said amendment is the incorporation of the
definition of the word "minerals" and the term "mineral
products".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged by petitioner that since the purpose of the amendment
was merely to clarify the meaning of said terms, the section should be
construed as if it had been originally passed in its amended form, so that
cement should be considered as "mineral product" even before the
enactment of Republic Act 1299<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>,
and therefore exempt from the sales or percentage tax, pursuant <span style="">to the provision of section 188(c) of the
National Internal Revenue Code.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">cannot subscribe to this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule in statutory
construction that a statute operates prospectively only and never retroactively,
unless the legislative intent to the contrary is made manifest either by the
express terms of the statute or by neces­sary implication.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In every case of doubt, the doubt must be
resolved against the retrospective effect.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is nothing in the context of the provision in question that would manifest the
Legislature's intention to have the provision apply to taxes due in the
past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the use of the
word, "shall" gives the unmistakable impression that the lawmakers
intended this enactment to be effective only <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>futuro</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite recently, in <u>Central </u></span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Azucarera</span></u></span><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">de </span>Don </u><u><span style="">Pedro vs.
Court of Tax </span></u><u><span style="">Appeals</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">this
Court sustained the holding of the re­spondent Court that section 51(d) of the
Tax Code, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">amended, which imposes the collection of interest
on a deficiency income tax assessment, became effective only on the approval of
the amendment, observing that the provision uses the phrase "shall be
assessed at the same time."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, careful
perusal of the explanatory note to House Bill No. 3251, which was later
approved as Re­public Act </span>No. <span style="">1299,
and the portions of the record of the discussions in Congress relative thereto,
reveals nothing that would suggest that the amendment was enacted to operate
retrospectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the purpose of the
amendment, as mentioned in the explanatory note to the bill, was not only to
"accelerate the collection of min­ing royalties and <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes but also clarify the doubt of the
tax-paying public on the interpretative scope of the two terms", it, certainly,
could not have been the intention of the lawmakers to unsettle previously
consummated transactions between the taxpayers and the Government, no matter in
what manner the meaning of the terms were construed in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No mention was made, in the deliberations,
about the taxes previously collected or assessed on the sales of cement,
although Congress must have been aware of these assessments due to an admitted
confusion as to the meaning of the terms defined in the amendment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, like other statutes,
tax laws operate pros­pectively, Whether they enact, amend or repeal, unless,
as aforesaid, the purpose of the Legislature to give retrospective effect is
expressly declared or may clearly be implied from the language used.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It thus results that before the enactment of
the amendment to section 246 of the Tax Code, when cement was not yet placed
under the category of either "minerals" or "mineral
products" it was not exempt from the percent­age tax imposed by section
186 of said Code, and was, therefore, taxable as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">manufactured product.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, We agree with the petitioner that the gypsum and bag
containers used in the production and sale of cement, are deductible from the
gross selling price in computing the 7% compensating tax levied on the sale of
cement before Republic Act 1299.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of any showing that the petitioner itself manufactured the bag
containers, the inference <span style="">is </span>that these bags were bought from others from whom taxes had
been levied for the ori­ginal <span style="">sale </span>thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same holds true with the gypsum used in
the process of the manufacture of cement, considering that said component is
imported,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Again, We agree with the petitioner in assigning as error of the
respondent Court its conclusion that for so much of the sales taxes that were
billed, Charged, and paid for by the petitioner’s customers, the petitioner is
not the proper party to claim refund.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first paragraph of section 186 of the Tax Code, pursuant to which
the 7% sales taxes were collected from the pe­titioner, reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"SEC. 186.- PERCENTAGE TAX ON SALES OF OTHER ARTICLES. - There
shall be levied, assessed and collected once only on every original sale,
barter, exchange, and similar transaction either for nominal or valuable considerations,
intended <span style="">to transfer ownership of, or
title to, the articles not enumerated in sections one hundred and eighty-four,
and one hundred and eighty-five a tax equivalent to seven per centum of the
gross selling price or gross value in money of the articles so sold, bartered,
exchanged, or transferred, </span><u>such tax </u><u><span style="">to be paid by the </span>manufacturer or producer</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, <span style="">That where the articles subject to tax under this Section are
manufactured out of materials likewise subject to tax under this section and
section one hundred and eighty-nine, the total cost of such materials, as duly
established shall be deductible from the gross selling price or gross value in
money of such manufactured articles."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
tax provided </span><span style="">under </span><span style="">this section of the Code is imposed upon the
manufacturer or producer and not on the purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this matter of who bears the burden of the
sales tax, this Court, after an extensive research on the subject, said:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">"We begin with an
analysis on the nature of the percentage (sales) tax </span>imposed by section
186 of the Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it a tax on the
producer or on the purchaser? Statutes of the type under consideration, which
impose <span style="">a </span>tax on sales, have
been described as ‘act (s) with schizophrenic symptoms’, as they apparently
have two faces - one that of a vendor tax, and the other, a vendee tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, for us, the provisions of the
Code throw some light on the problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Code states that the sales tax 'shall be paid by the manufacturer or
producer,’ who must make <span style="">a </span>true
and complete return of the amount of his, her or its gross monthly sales,
receipts or earn­ings or gross value of output actually <span style="">removed from the factory or mill ware­ </span>house and within twenty
days after the end of each month, pay the tax due thereon.’</p>

<p class="2Q">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></p>

<p class="2Q">"It may indeed be that the economic burden of the tax finally
falls on<span style=""> the purchaser; when it does
the tax </span>becomes a part of the price which the purchaser must pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not matter <span style="">that an additional amount is billed as tax to the purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The method of listing the price and the tax
separately and defining </span>taxable gross re<span style="">ceipts as the amount received less the amount of the tax added, merely
avoids payment by the seller of a tax on the </span>amount of the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect is still <span style="">the same, namely, that the purchaser does not pay the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pays or may pay the seller more for the
goods because of the seller's obligation, but that is </span>all <span style="">and the amount added because of the tax is
paid to get the goods and for nothing else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“But the tax burden may not even be shifted to the purchaser at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A decision to absorb the burden of
the tax is largely a matter of economics.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then it can <span style="">no </span>longer be
contended that a sales tax is a tax on the purchaser."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">It
follows that it is petitioner, and not its customers, that may ask for a refund
of whatever amounts it is entitled for the percentage or sales taxes it paid before
the amendment of section 246 of the Tax Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner finally disputes
the ruling of the respondent Court that the action for refund </span>has <span style="">prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its contention is that the defense of prescription was belated in that
it was raised for the first time in the answer of respondent when the original
petition was amended to incorporate more explicitly petitioner's claim for refund
of <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes paid on cement
produced during the period from </span><st1:date year="1955" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1955</span></st1:date><span style=""> to </span><st1:date year="1956" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In analyzing this issue,
We need to first have a complete perspective of the original and amended pleadings
filed by the parties in the Court of Tax Appeals, thus - On January 24, 1957,
the petitioner filed its petition for review, claiming refund of sales or
percentage taxes </span>amounting to P448,893.63.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its answer of <st1:date year="1957" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1957</st1:date>, respondent did not raise the
defense of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1959</st1:date>, respondent filed an
amended answer but again said defense was not included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1959</st1:date>, the petitioner asked for leave to file an amended
petition for review in which amendment it added the sum of P400,499.99
representing overpaid <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes,
in its claim for refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1959</st1:date>, the amended
petition was deemed admitted as of the date of its filing on <st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1959</st1:date>, and respondent was
given time to file his answer. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
respondent filed his answer on <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="2">February
 26, 1960</st1:date>, this time pleading prescrip­tion as a defense insofar as
portion of the sales tax sought to be refunded was paid more than two years
from the date the petition for review was filed with the Tax Court. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On June 23, 1961, the petitioner re-amended
its petition with said court praying, finally, that respondent be ordered to
refund the amount of P458,241.45 paid as percentage taxes, and the amount of
P427,552.95, re­presenting overpayments of <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
taxes; or alternatively, the amount of P590,649.92, or P854,619.89, depending
on the correct basis for the computation of the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 306 of the Tax Code provides:</p>

<p class="2Q">"RECOVERY OF TAX ERRONEOUSLY OR ILLEGALLY COLLECTED. - No suit
or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any national
internal revenue tax here­after alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without
authority, or of any sum alleged to have been ex­cessively or in any manner
wrong­fully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed
with the Collector of Internal Reve­nue; but such suit or proceeding may be

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Construing the above provision, this
Court has ruled that the two requirements - (1) filing of a written claim for
refund with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; and, (2) institution of a

mandatory and noncompliance therewith is fatal.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the refund of the 7% sales or
percent­age, taxes covering the period from November 1, 1954 to March, 1955,
amounting to <span style="">P446,898.63, </span>as
shown in Annex A of the Amended Petition, the suit is deemed to have been
instituted on January 24, 1957, when the original petition was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counting two years back, that is to <st1:date year="1955" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1955</st1:date>, all taxes paid
after this date may still be properly refunded, speaking from the prescription
angle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the allegedly overpaid <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes of 1-1/2% for the pe­riod from
April, 1955 to September, 1956 amounting to P400,499.99, the suit should be
deemed to have been insti­tuted only with the filing of the amended petition on
Octo­ber 24, 1959, which added <span style="">as a </span>new
cause of action the recovery of said overpaid <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>

from <st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1959</st1:date>,
when the amended complaint was filed, to <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1957</st1:date> - all taxes paid thereafter may still be
recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not claimed, however,
nor is there any showing, that among the alleged over payments of <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes were remitted after <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="10">Octo­ber 25, 1957</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the contention that "with respect to the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes paid for the period from April 1, 1955
though not explicitly included in the original petition, was actually mentioned
therein and should therefore be deemed filed on the date of the original petition,
We note that the aforesaid <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
taxes were only mentioned in Annex 'A' to the petition as part of the
tabulation of taxes paid by petitioner to the respondent, but in the body of
the petition itself, the refund of said payments was not sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the allegations in said original petition
pertain to and are in support of petitioner’s claim for refund of the sales
taxes in question.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in computing the
gross selling price of the cement as basis for the 7% percentage tax levied in
pursuance to section 186, the cost of the bag containers used in the sale, and
the gypsum used in the manufacture, of cement should be deducted;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the petitioner, and
not its customers, is the proper party to seek refund of taxes erroneously paid
under section 186 of the Tax Code;</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the action for
refund has not prescribed in so far as concerns the sales or percentage taxes
paid after <st1:date year="1955" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1955</st1:date>;</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That action for refund
