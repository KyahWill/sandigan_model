tests the applicability of the constitutionally secured tenure provision to a
1962 administrative order requiring the transfer of principal teachers who have
completed five years or more of service in one station, under which appellant,
a principal assigned to <span class="SpellE">Sinalang</span> Elementary School, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, was reassigned in

assigned to the <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span> West Elementary School or be

professional, with their child who was born abnormal requiring personal
attention, her transfer would work hardships on her family; (2) her transfer
was not required by the exigency of public service because there was no
complaint against her as principal of <span class="SpellE">Sinalang</span>
Elementary School or against the principal of <span class="SpellE">Peñarrubia</span>
Elementary School; and (3) that the transfer was disciplinary in character and

The Superintendent stood firm.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1963</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed the verified complaint below.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Named defendant was Mariano R. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, the Division
Superintendent of Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
complaint sought a declaration of nullity of the transfer order, moral damages
resulting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and preliminary mandatory
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It averred that defendant
acted in excess of his authority, in abuse of discretion and in violation of
the Civil Service Law in issuing Division Letter 31; that her transfer was a
demotion in rank, disciplinary in character, and yet she was not accorded due
process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Mariano R. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> answered
on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1963</st1:date> and opposed
the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court granted the writ after
hearing and upon the filing of the required bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits following a partial stipulation of
facts, the lower court rendered its decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1963</st1:date> dismissing the complaint without costs,
dissolving the injunction and <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 31, 1963, plaintiff moved to reconsider upon the
ground that paragraph (a) (3) of Section 318 of the Service Manual,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Circular 28 and Division Letter 31, are unconsti­tutional, for they amount to
her removal, a violation of her security of tenure protected by Section 4,
Article XII of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1963</st1:date>, defendant
opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1963</st1:date>, the court perfunctorily
rejected reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff appealed to
this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, against the insistence of school authorities that she
proceed to <span class="SpellE">Peñarrubia</span> Elementary School pending
appeal, refused to occupy the position for the reason that such action might be
construed <span style="">as a waiver </span>of her
right to appeal and render the issue academic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, on December 5, 1963, pending perfection of her appeal, she
registered in the court below a motion for status quo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Opposed by defendant, the motion was denied
by the lower court on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="12">December 17,
 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1964</st1:date>, she reiterated her
request in this Court by filing <span style="">a </span>Petition for a Declaration of Status Quo
Pending Appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The provincial fiscal, representing defendant Superintendent, offered no

gave a retroactive application to Circular 18, series of 1964, which modified
Circular 28, series of 1962, to the effect that transfers of principals must
first be approved by the Director of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Solicitor General opposed the
petition,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">An administrative charge for insubordination was instituted
against Juliana <span style="">B. </span><span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="9">September <span style="">29,
 </span>1964</st1:date>, the Commissioner of Civil Service decided the
administrative case for insubordination against plaintiff by dismissing her
from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon appellant's
motion for reconsideration of her dismissal, this sentence was modified on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="6">June <span style="">23,
 </span>1965</st1:date> by reducing it to suspension for ten months without pay
coupled with a warning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff thus petitioned this Court that status quo be
maintained and that the Commissioner be ordered to show cause why he should not
be dealt with for contempt for declar­ing her guilty of insubordination pending
appeal before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on March 22, 1966, this Court resolved (a) to deny the
petition for declaration of status quo; (b) to defer action on the petition that
the Commissioner of Civil Service be required to show cause why he should not
be punished for contempt and that the decision and resolution of the Commis­sioner
finding plaintiff guilty of insubordination be declared null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>, until
the decision of this case on the merits.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Arguing that an appointment as principal in the Bureau of
Public Schools and <u><span style="">assignment</span></u><span style=""> </span>to a particular <span style="">school are inseparable, plaintiff maintains
that her <span class="SpellE">unconsented</span> transfer to another school by
virtue of an administrative direc­tive amounts to a removal - prohibited by the
Constitution</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and the Civil Service Act - which cannot be
done unless for causes specified by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's confident stride falters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took too loose a view of the applicable
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her refuge behind the
mantle of security of tenure guaranteed by the Constitution is not
impenetrable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She proceeds upon the
assumption that she occupies her station in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sinalang</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
by appoint­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But her first
appointment <span style="">as </span>Principal merely
reads, thus: "You are hereby appointed a <u><span style="">Principal</span></u><span style=""> <u>(Elementary</u>
</span><u>School</u>) <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Bureau</u> <u>of</u> <u>Public</u>
<u>Schools,</u> <u><span style="">Department</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">Education,</span></u><span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
without mentioning her station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
cannot therefore claim security of tenure as Principal of <span class="SpellE">Sinalang</span>
Elementary School or any parti­cular station.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She may be assigned to any station as exigency of public service
requires, even without her consent.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
She thus has no right of choice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rule pursued by
plaintiff only goes so far as the appoint­ment indicates a specific
station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the constitutionally
ordained security of tenure cannot shield her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In appointments of this nature, this Court has consistently rejected the
officer's demand to remain - even as public service dictates that a transfer be
made - in a particular station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial
attitude toward trans­fers of this nature is expressed </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the following statement in <u>Ibanez</u> <u>vs</u>. </span><u><span style="">Commission</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">on</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Elections</span></u><span style="">:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That security of tenure is an essential and constitutionally
guaranteed feature of our Civil Service system, is not open to debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mantle of its protection extends not only
against removals without cause but also against <span class="SpellE">unconsented</span>
transfers which, as repeatedly enunciated, are tantamount to removals which are
within the ambit of the fundamental guarantee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the availability of that security of tenure necessarily
depends, in the first instance, upon 'the nature of the appointment (<span class="SpellE">Hojilla</span> vs. Marino, et al., G.R. L-20574,<span style=""> </span>February 26, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such that the rule which proscribes transfers

<p class="NUM">2. The attack against the <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="9">September
 11, 1962</st1:date> directive of the Department of Education and Circular 28,
series of 1962, of the Director of Public Schools dated <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1962</st1:date>, is as misdirected.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the foregoing directive and circular, a policy exists that
certain school officials, amongst them elementary school principals, whose
salaries are payable from the national funds are to be transferred upon completion
of five years of service in one station in order to prevent a situation where
they become "stale and unchallenged by new situations and conditions"
and "administrative problems accumulate."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The administrative order applies only to principals, super­visors,
superintendents and administrative officers <u>whose</u> <u>salaries</u> <u>are</u>
<u>payable</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>national</u> <u>funds</u> and who,
presumably, hold appointments of the same nature as plaintiff's, that <span style="">is, </span>without
specific station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order cannot
therefore be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the constitutionally
enshrined security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
secured right of a holder of an appointment without specific station <u>is</u> <u>the</u>
<u>position itself</u> but not the station to which he may have been assigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The charge that the order is arbitrary may not be
entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Department of Education
directive of <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1962</st1:date>
is a valid exercise of the rule-making power of the Secretary of Education <span style="">governing the internal regulation of officers
under his Depart­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This power </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">granted to him by Section 79(B) of the
Revised Administrative Code, quoted as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 79(B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Power</u>
<u>to</u><span style=""> <u>regulate</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</span> The Department Head shall have power
to promul­gate, whenever he may see fit to do so, all rules, regulations,
orders, circulars, memorandums, and other instructions, not contrary to law,
neces­sary to regulate the proper working and harmonious and efficient
administration of each and all of the offices and dependencies of his
Department, and for the strict enforcement and proper execution of the laws
relative to matters under the juris­diction of said Department; x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the same manner then, the implementing order of the Director of
Public Schools in Circular 28, series of 1962, as well as the implementing
letter of defendant Division Superin­tendent of Schools dated <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1963</st1:date> are <span style="">not </span>tainted with arbitrariness.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Besides, the Department of Education directive left the door open
for exemptions to the policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It says:
"Individual cases requiring exemption from this general policy [of
transfers upon completion of five years] may be submitted to this Office for
appropriate decision."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Secretary of Education could thus authorize such exemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">But plaintiff did not make any formal application of this nature
with the Secretary of Education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we
treat her request made with the Director of Public Schools as equivalent to an
application for exemption with the Secretary of Education, we cannot easily
downgrade the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> decision denying her
request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, we perceive no abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, she went to court on questions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By jurisprudence, this suffices to take her
case out of the operative area of the principle of exhaustion of administrative
remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in this, however, her
cause must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find nothing illegal
or unconstitutional about her transfer.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Dissentient, plaintiff insists that her <span class="SpellE">unconsented</span>
transfer is a demotion in rank and therefore disciplinary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In which case, so she argues, the transfer
cannot be made without any previous investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thumbs with meticulous care <span style="">the difference between <span class="SpellE">Peñarrubia</span>
Elementary School to which she was transferred and <span class="SpellE">Sinalang</span>
Elementary School which she occupied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first is not a pilot demonstration school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is six kilometers from her hometown and
has only thirteen teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the latter, being a pilot school located in her hometown, receives funds
from the ICA-NEC and is already staffed with twenty-three teachers.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the WAPCO Classification Pay Plan<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

twenty-five teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Principal II has a
faculty of more than twenty-five teachers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Transfers must be made in accord with this classification.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
A principal I may not be transferred to a school having more than twenty-five
teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In turn, a principal II may
not be transferred to a school with a faculty of twenty-five or less
teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, transfers
must be made within the same salary range.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When, however, the number of teachers in a particular school, which
previously had only twenty-five or less teachers, increases to more than
twenty-five, the Division Superintendent of Schools should make a
recommendation to effect a reclassifi­cation of the principal assigned to that
school to Principal II.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is on this last point that plaintiff anchors her plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That just as she had almost reached the
required number of teachers under her staff to enable her reclassification to

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find no reason to

<blockquote>"As to plaintiff's allegation that her chance of promotion to
Principal II <span style="">is
</span>remote inasmuch as in <span class="SpellE">Sinalang</span> Pilot
Elementary School there are <span style="">23 teachers
while in <span class="SpellE">Peñarrubia</span> Elementary School there are only
13 teachers is not only denied by the defendant, but Circular No. 22, Series of
1960, of the Bureau of Public Schools dated July 20, 1960, entitled 'Merit and
Seniority Ranking System', Exhibit '6' (Roll of Exhibits), shows that in the
selection of personnel for promotion to higher positions several items should
be considered in preparing the rank list of elementary school prin­cipals, such
as (a) educational qualifications, (b) civil service eligibility, (c)
efficiency, (d) expe­rience and (e) educational leadership and executive
ability, so that the number of teachers under the supervision of the candidate
is not a factor to be considered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, G.L. No. 77 dated. June 1, 1959, of the Director of Public
Schools, Exhibit '<span class="SpellE">ll</span>' (Roll of Exhibits), states that
'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Elementary school principals in schools with
25 or more teachers are classified as Elementary School Principal II and those
assigned in school with less than 25 teachers (sic) are classified as
Elementary School Principal I.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> So that it is immaterial whether plaintiff </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">Elementary School Principal I should have 13
or 23 teachers under her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
plaintiff's transfer to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Peñarrubia</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Elementary School</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> does not in any </span><span style="">way </span><span style="">affect her rank as Elementary School
Principal I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further contended by
plaintiff that her transfer in question was a demotion because it was not only
motivated by personal reasons, on account of a misunderstanding with the herein
defendant, but also because her choice of station was disregarded, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> result of which would work
hard­ship to her family, hence, defendant's act was illegal and arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> this contention defendant vehemently denied, for if that
were true, he could have ordered plaintiff's transfer to a school farther away
from her home than <span class="SpellE">Peñarrubia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from this, however, the evidence shows
that she was not the only one who was transferred to another station but also <u>all</u>
<u>the</u> <u>other</u> </span><u><span style="">elementary</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">school</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">principals,</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">whose respective assignments were made for </span><u><span style="">public</span></u><span style=""> <u>interest</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The fact is also clear that her transfer to <span class="SpellE">Peñarrubia</span> Elementary School does not affect her promotion,
rank and salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is corro­borated
by the Certificate of the Record Clerk of the Division of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>
dated July 31, 1963 to the effect that </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">Principal I for the year 1963-64, she will receive an annual salary,
based on WAPCO Pay Plan, the amount of P3,432.00, <u>instead</u> of her present
salary of P3,264.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '5', Roll of Exhibits). In
other words, <u>there</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>demotion</u> <u>to</u> </span><u><span style="">speak</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">of</span></u><span style="">, <u>since</u> <u>there</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u>

<u>of</u> <u>such</u> </span><u><span style="">transfer</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">There being no reduction in position, rank,
or salary, this Court is of the opinion that the act of the defendant in
transferring the plain­tiff is not disciplinary in nature."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">5. Surely, the argument that defendant acted arbitrarily because
there was no complaint filed against plaintiff as Principal of <span class="SpellE">Sinalang</span> Elementary School and that therefore her transfer
was not required by the exigency of public <span style="">service is </span><span style="">a </span>narrow concept of the meaning of
public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason put forth by
defendant that her efficiency and her experience <span style="">as </span>Principal in a pilot school would
spur the improvement of small schools is enough to justify her transfer.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>It is in

<p class="NUM">6. In a case like the present, where appeal is pending resolution
in the Supreme Court, school authorities should be cautious in charging -
before the Civil Service Commission - a school teacher with insubordination for
failure to comply with <span style="">their directive,
subject of appeal in an appellate court and which was not stopped by
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the interest of the
service may be urged in enforcing such directive, factors there are which
should outweigh the exercise thereof whilst the court case remains unresolved.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">First, plaintiff acted in good faith believing that her refusal
to obey the transfer was legally defensible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She felt that a wrong had been committed against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her transfer from her post as principal
teacher in a pilot elementary school with 23 teachers in the provincial
capital, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, her place of residence - meant
inconvenience as well as loss of prestige.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, she was to be transferred to a small town with but only 13
teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this situation, it is not
so easy to erase from her mind the thinking that transfer took the form of
disciplinary action, even if, as later found, some such thoughts were mis­conceived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to court for redress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had faith in the administration of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She entertained the belief that
to bow to the demands of her superiors pending her appeal would jeopardize such
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is, of course, a
mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But again, it is quite
understandable.</p>

<p class="BODY">And then, public officials should not give cause for suspicion on
the part of their subordinates that persecution <span style="">has </span>taken the better part of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the transfer here involved took
place, the superintendent's authority to trans­fer in the interest of the
service could easily be abused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
seem to us, on the face, of subsequent events, that <span style="">such </span>practice could have really generated low morale amongst the
teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That power was, in fact,
reduced when Circular 18, series of 1964 - while this case was pending appeal -
was promulgated by the Director of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circular exacted approval by the
Director of Public Schools, prior to implementation, of any transfer plan to be
made by the Division Superintendent.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Then came the Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span> for Public School Teachers, Republic Act 4670,
approved on June 18, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A teacher may
not now "be transferred without his consent from one station to
another" <span style="">except "for cause
and as herein otherwise provided." The Magna <span class="SpellE">Carta</span>
enjoins that "[w]here the exigencies of the service require the transfer
of a teacher from one station to another, such transfer may be effected by the
school superintendent who shall previously notify the teacher con­cerned of the
transfer and the reason or reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the teacher believes there is "no
justification for the transfer", he may appeal his case to the Director of
Public Schools or to the Director of Vocational Education, as </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">case may be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, pending his appeal and the decision thereon, "his transfer
shall be held in abeyance."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On top of all these is that implementation of the power to
transfer, pending appeal in the appellate courts, may bring about an
undesirable conflict of opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppose
by reason of an insubordination charge, a teacher <span style="">is </span>dismissed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then thereafter on appeal the Court
pronounces judgment in favor of the teacher? In this particular situation, it
is, indeed, dangerous to allow the Commissioner of Civil Service to dip his
hand into a question that still awaits final resolution by courts of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">So it is, that this Court
</span><span style="">is </span><span style="">duty-bound to nullify the decision and
resolution of the Commissioner of Civil Service first dismissing plaintiff and
thereafter reducing her penalty to 10 months' suspension without pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">7. Finally, there is no point in ordering the Commis­sioner of
Civil Service to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt for
finding plaintiff guilty of insubor­dination pending her appeal before this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commis­sioner's decision and
resolution aforesaid came as a result of an administrative charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant had not previously applied to this
Court to inhibit the Commissioner from trying the ad­ministrative charge
pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aforesaid, there was
no injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was then no court
order, violation of which could have given cause for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> in Civil Case No. 359 appealed from
is affirmed; however, the <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="6">June 23,

sentencing herein plaintiff-appellant Juliana B. <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>

null and void.</p>
