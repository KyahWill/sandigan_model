				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The plea of appellant Juanita <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span>
for the reversal of his conviction for the crime of robbery with homicide and
serious physical injuries is based on the insufficiency of the proof to
demonstrate his guilt beyond reasonable doubt as the confession attributed to
him was allegedly obtained by means of torture and the infliction of body
injuries and there was not enough testimonial evidence to justify the finding
that he was liable for the crime committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The information for the above offense was filed against five accused,
but only Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span> and Juanita <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span> were adjudged guilty.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
An appeal was duly taken to this Court by both of them, but Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span> having escaped from the provincial jail on <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1966</st1:date>, his appeal was
dismissed.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span> is thus the sole
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As will hereafter be shown,
his contention that an extra-judicial confession was involuntary, having been
extorted by force, must be given credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is not, however, entitled to an acquittal, as the oral testimony
contrary to his assertion did clearly point him as one of the perpetrators of
the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conviction
cannot be reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tragic occurrence took place on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> that morning, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> and his wife, Juliana
<span class="SpellE">Reginaldo</span>, were asleep in their house in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Cadlan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were awakened by the barking of their
dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
stood up and armed himself with his bolo and an iron pipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceed­ing to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>,
he saw five men entering his house through the doors leading to the veranda as
well as the kitchen.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In no time at all, one of them, recognized by him as appellant <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span>, wrested the
iron pipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span>, in turn sought to take away from him his
bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Iron pipe in hand, appellant was
heard by <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> demanding from his wife, Juliana <span class="SpellE">Reginaldo</span>, her key, prompting her to exclaim:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Juanita, why are you doing this to
us?" This was followed by her plea for help, as she was beaten up with
such weapon.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span> in turn succeeded in
relieving <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> of his bolo and to use it against,
the latter, wounding him on the back of his head and thus causing him to fall
to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until almost
dawn that morning that he regained consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His son, Rafael, was then attending to his
wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was asked by his father to
report what happened to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> was then taken to the provincial
hospital in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> so that he could receive
medical care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise testified that
of the raiding party of five, he could identify only appellant and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
occasion of such robbery, he suffered a loss of one sack of rice valued at ten
pesos.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With the incident being reported to the Philippine Constabulary
at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on the same morning, two sergeants<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and two corporals<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
were directed to investigate the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon their arrival, what greeted them at the scene of the crime at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> that morning were the lifeless
body of the wife, Juliana <span class="SpellE">Reginaldo</span>, lying flat on
the floor, the iron pipe and the bolo stained with blood.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
They were told by the son, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span>, that his
father was in the provincial hospital in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceeding to said place, <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span>
pointed to appellant and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span> with three
other persons who were responsible for the killing and the robbery.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Acting on this information, they brought the two to the hospital where they
were readily identified by <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> as the
perpetrators.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The death of the wife, according to the doctor who performed the autopsy, was
due to the "acute internal and secondary hemorrhage, because of the
multiple wounds on the head and fracture of the skull."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The oral testimony of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span>, in the opinion of the lower court, was
"corroborated and strengthened by the [extra-judicial statement] under
oath" of appellant <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span>
wherein it was admitted that he was among the group of five persons who went to
the house of the <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> spouses precisely for the
purpose of taking away the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> stored therein.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span> There
was thus a rejection of the claim made that such confession was
involuntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of alibi put up
by appellant was rejected in view of the positive identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence his conviction for the crime of robbery
with homicide and serious physical injuries, being sentenced to pay the heirs
of Juliana <span class="SpellE">Reginaldo</span> the amount of P5,000.00 and to
pay <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> the
amount of P10.00 representing the value of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the conviction of appellant were predicated solely on the
confession, he would be entitled to acquittal, his attack on its voluntary
character having support in the evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, sufficient basis for the
finding of guilt as the testimonial evidence is sufficiently weighty and the defense
of alibi utterly unconvincing.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The Constitution in its Bill of Rights explicitly guarantees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No person shall be compelled to be a
witness against himself."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> There is thus a safe­guard against
the compulsory disclosure of incriminating facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not bar, as Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> pointed out,<span style="">
the conviction of an accused "on a voluntary extrajudicial statement * *
*."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a><span style=""> Certainly, however, where the confession is
involuntary, being due to maltreatment or induced by fear or intimidation,
there is a violation of this constitutional provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any form of coercion whether physical,
mental, or emotional thus stamps it with in­admissibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is essential for its validity is that it
proceeds from the free will of the person confessing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is the prevailing principle even prior to the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and
the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 as well as a statute enacted in 1903, there
is the requirement that a confession to be received as evidence must be shown
to be freely and voluntarily made and not the result of violence, intimidation,
threat, menace, or promise or offer of reward or leniency.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>
Why it should be thus was explained in an early leading case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Involuntary confessions are rejected by
all courts — by some on the ground that a confession so obtained is unreliable;
and by some on the grounds of humanitarian principles which abhor all forms of
torture or unfairness toward the accused in criminal proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But either theory arrives at the same goal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a confession is not legal evidence and
must be rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accused
satisfactorily shows that it was made involuntarily, the confession stands
discredited in the eyes of the law and is as a thing which never existed."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a>
Such a thought finds expression in an even earlier decision, <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. Navarro,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a>promulgated
in 1904.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The provision, that no one is bound to
criminate himself is older than the Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At an early day it became a part of the common law of <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was established on the grounds of public
policy and humanity — of policy because if the party were required to testify,
it would place the witness under the strongest temptation to commit the crime
of perjury, and of humanity, because it would prevent the extorting of
confessions by duress."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is no surprise then that where there was ample basis in a
habeas corpus proceeding for petitioner's contention as to the signature on his
confessions in the eight cases where he did plead guilty being due to his
desire to avoid any further torture or maltreatment, this Court, through
Justice Perfecto reached this conclusion:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The facts proved by petitioner convince us that the sentences
rendered in the eight cases in question are null and void and should not be
given an effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a> As a result, the release from
confinement of petitioner was ordered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, too, in line with this controlling doctrine, there is this
relevant excerpt from an opinion of Justice Labrador:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We cannot close our ears to the stories
of maltreatment used to extort the confession in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts are not unaware that some officers of
the law resort to illegal and reprehensible tactics to extort confessions, and
had had occasions to express condemnation of such tactics."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is unfortunate that the lower court failed to abide by the
authoritative doctrines that ban the use of involuntary confessions in
accordance with the constitutional provision against self-incrimination which,
in the language of Justice Sanchez, should be "mandatory", being
"a valuable and substantive right".<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a> Appellant testified that on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1961</st1:date>, while he was being
investigated at the constabulary barracks, he was boxed repeatedly in different
parts of the body, at one time made to lie down after being blind-folded and
then Water poured on his face.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a> He repeated that before signing
the confession on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1961</st1:date>,
he was like­wise subjected to physical maltreatment, having been boxed many
times on the breast and stomach.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a> His testimony received
confirmation from a competent and <span class="SpellE">netural</span> source, Dr.
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Villafuerte</span>, the city health officer of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>, who examined appellant on June 27, 1961 in the
provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
seventeen days after his being apprehended and taken to the constabulary
barracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked what he found on
the person of appellant, this was his answer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"He has five lesions here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tenderness of the stomach on the left; elongated scar, lower third of
the left forearm; healing wound, circular in shape on the elbow, left side;
sensation of deafness and easily nervous."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a> When questioned as to what could
have caused the tenderness, he replied as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That is trauma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The elongated scar on the lower third might
have been produced by a stick; the healing wound circular in form, he might
have fallen on a hard object and the sensation of deafness, if you try to hit
the two ears with the palm, there is compression of the ear drum, so that the
hearing is inter­fered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this
will be temporary in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Easily
nervous, because of fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I examined him
in jail."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above testimony notwithstanding, the lower court could still
look upon such confession as free of any infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, that was error, as pointed out by
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constant course of
decisions of this honorable Tribunal, true to the meaning of the
self-incrimination clause, forbids the admission of any confession obtained
under such circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to
render nugatory a valuable constitutional right if judges of the courts of
first instance display less than full sensitivity to its command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conviction resting on such proof, and such
proof alone, certainly cannot be allowed to stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise timely to impress anew on police officials that
the imperative requirements of truth and of humanity condemn the utilization of
force and violence to extract confessions from unwilling victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crime must be punished and the guilty must
not be allowed to escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A desirable
end cannot, however, be attained by unconstitutional means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be less than full respect for
the law if in the process of enforcing it lawless methods are employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, then, this Court is called upon
to manifest in the strongest language possible its abhorrence for the
employment of force to compel a person to sign a statement acknowledging guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A decent regard for the dignity that attaches
to every human being as such will be satisfied with nothing less.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Nonetheless, a reversal is not called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is sufficient competent and credible
evidence of record pointing unerringly to the guilt of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His brief, in two other errors assigned,
would impute the perpetration of the deed </span><span style="">"to someone else,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a><span style=""> By that cryptic statement, reference is made to the testimony of his
own thirteen-year-old daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soledad <span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span>, who did, on the witness stand, declare that on
the morning of June 9, 1969 there was a quarrel between the <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span>
spouses presumably due to the wife having applied to work as a maid in the
household of a certain family in Naga.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a><span style=""> She even went so far as to state that she saw the deceased hitting,
with a piece of pipe, the head of her husband, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span>, who retaliated by using the bolo on her.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a><span style=""> Certainly, it is understandable why the
lower court could not be expected that such an assertion, coming from the
daughter, could disprove what was testified to by <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span> as to the fatal beating inflicted on his wife
by appellant on the occasion of a robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor could appellant's responsibility for the gory occurrence be
wiped away by the simple disclaimer that he was, during the night of June 9,
1961, asleep in his house, leaving the place only the next morning to harvest
palay.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a>
His defense of alibi was sought to be bolstered by still another member of the
family, his wife, who affirmed that on the evening of <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1961</st1:date> appellant was sleeping in their
house, but likewise admitted that the residence of the <span class="SpellE">Ongkit</span>
spouses was only about fifty meters away.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a> The lower court did not accept
such a version.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable
why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His identification coming from a
neighbor was easily believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
alibi which did not preclude appellant's having taken the time to go with his
other co-accused to a house only fifty meters away during the course of the
evening, was not calculated to impress any court of justice with its truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was stressed in Justice Castro's opinion
in People v. Alcantara:<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a> "The appellant's main defense
in exculpation is alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
stressed at the outset that alibi is one of the weakest defenses that can be
resorted to by an accused, especially if there is direct testimony of an
eyewitness duly corroborated by that of another, not only because it is
inherently weak and unreliable but also because of the ease of fabricating
evidence of alibi and the difficulty of checking or rebutting it.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a>
People v. Estrada<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a> was cited in support of such a
view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No jurisprudence in criminal cases is
more settled than the rule that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and that
the same should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently
and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such should be the rule, for as a defense,
alibi is easy to concoct, and difficult to disprove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for alibi to prosper, it is not enough to
prove that defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed, but he
must, likewise, demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have
been at the scene of the crime at the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">34</span></span></a> Only last January, such a view was
reiterated by the Chief Justice in People v. Provo<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a>
in these words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Needless to say,
as one of the weakest defenses available in criminal cases, the alibi set up by
appellant herein cannot offset the testimony of Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>,
who positively identified him as one of those who seized <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
Serrano, at <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, in the evening of October 9, 1958*
* *."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36</span></span></a>
In the light of the fore­going, the guilt of the accused having been
demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt, the inadmissibility of the confession
extorted from appellant could not justify a reversal of his conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a></p>

been dismissed after appellant was arraigned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The filing of the two cases was the result of a mistake committed by a
