<p class="BODY">The Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(National Irrigation Administration) appealed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission
which reversed the decision of the Hearing Officer on the ground that the
illness of hemorrhagic <span class="SpellE">pancreatitis</span> which resulted in
the death of Mariano Reyes was neither caused nor aggravated by his employment
as carpenter of the National Irrigation Administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the illness of Mariano Reyes was
caused or aggravated by his work as carpenter of the National Irrigation
Administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the Hearing Officer, are:</p>

<blockquote>"During the hearing of the case, both parties were allowed to
present their evidence, documentary as well as testimonial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence adduced during the hearing of
the case disclosed that the late Mariano Reyes was employed by the respondent
as a carpenter since <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1973</st1:date>
with a daily wage of P9.17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
carpenter he works in the construction of a shed and works 8 hours a day, 5
days in a week and worked overtime up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00
 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on or about <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6:00
 o'clock a.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="7">July 4,
 1973</st1:date> he was found dead at the bunkhouse of Campsite, <span class="SpellE">Pantabangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased
was legally married to the claimant-widow and out of their wedlock, they have
begotten seven children namely <span class="SpellE">Zita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Prescilla</span>, Alexander, <span class="SpellE">Joselene</span>,
Mariano Jr., Rolando and <span class="SpellE">Jine</span> all minors (Exhibits
'D', 'E', 'G', 'H', 'I', and 'J') and said widow and children were dependent
from the earnings of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the funeral services including the tomb the widow spent about P1,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The only issue to be resolved in the instant case is whether
or not the death of Mariano Reyes arose out and in the course of his
employment, or work connected aggravated by the nature of his employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As shown by the evidence on record the claimant testified
that prior to her husband's employment with the respondent the deceased worked
as a carpenter in Luna, La Union and complained about his eyes and stomach
pains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That when he took his vacation
from his work in the NIA, <span class="SpellE">Pantabangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, he was pale and
yellowish and thin as the work is hard and that he worked overtime from 6:00
o'clock p.m. up to 12:00 o'clock in the evening continuously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the claimant is bolstered by
the fact that the very witness of the respondent Eng. <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
Alfonso, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>Superintendent</st1:placename></st1:place>,
UPRP, <span class="SpellE">Pantabangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, admitted that the deceased worked overtime at the
shed up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening before he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1973</st1:date> he made a report of death
incident (Exhibit '1') regarding the death of Mariano Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased was requested to work overtime
from <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1973</st1:date> in the construction of a
swimming pool and at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="5">5:00 o'clock a.m.</st1:time>
the following day he was discovered dead with an unknown cause by his
co-employees in the bunkhouse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> the physician of
project issued the death certificate of the deceased (Exhibit 'K') and under
the medical certificate portion of the death certificate I-Disease or condition
directly leading death; antecedent causes:<span style="">&nbsp;

contributing to the death but not related to the disease or condition causing
death - 'Over fatigue'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Eng. <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Alfonso further
testified that the deceased is very obedient, diligent and hardworking
dedicated to the government and when asked about his personal view about the
deceased he answered 'since the deceased is under my supervision and worked <span class="SpellE">truely</span> on overtime I believe the cause of the death as per
stated by our physician was connected to his work." (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is undisputed that the

Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> (National Irrigation Administration), failed
to show that the illness of Mariano Reyes was neither caused nor aggravated by
his employment as carpenter in the Upper <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the petitioner
adduced evidence to show that Mariano Reyes had been working overtime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the death certificate of the
deceased, Exhibit "K", issued by Dr. Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>,
the physician of the project, over fatigue contributed to the death of Mariano

the illness of Mariano Reyes was directly caused by the nature of his work with
the National Irrigation Administration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Hearing Officer of
Regional Office No. 1, Department of Labor, awarded death compensation to the
petitioner on the basis of the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the deceased average weekly wage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deceased was receiving P9.17 per day or an average weekly wage of P45.85 but
under Section 12 of the Act, however the average weekly wage in death case
should be reckoned at not more than P50.00 and 60% of P45.85 is P27.51 times
208 weeks gives a total death compensation of P5,722.00 plus P200.00 burial
