<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> died in 1940 and was survived

survived by her 12 children who, like Ana's four children, are not parties to
the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The land left by the late <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span> was brought for registration before a cadastral
court in 1922 and the Original Certificate of Title No. 0-15 was issued on <st1:date year="1950" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1950</st1:date> in the name of 26
persons, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the three living
children of <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>, namely, <st1:city><st1:place>Petra</st1:place></st1:city>,
Eugenia and Felix <span class="SpellE">Bocase</span>, and their 23 nephews and
nieces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of title, after
its issuance, was delivered to the petitioner by the respondents' counsel in
the cadas­tral case, one Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suazo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner still had the said certificate
of title in his possession <span style="">at the time
the case was commenced in the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 9, 1958, the respondents filed with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and damages against the petitioner, alleging
basically that, together with their cousins, the children of <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> and Ana, they are <span class="SpellE">pro­indiviso</span>
registered owners of the land covered by O.C.T. No. 0-15; that <span style="">in </span>or about June 1953, the petitioner
illegally, maliciously, and by means of force and intimidation, entered the
land in question and occupied approximately 27,500 square meters thereof, which
portion, prior thereto, was in their possession as their share pursuant to a
partition agreed upon by <span style="">the co-owners
thereof; and that since June 1953, the petitioner had been collecting rentals
from the owners of houses built thereon in the total sum of P</span><span style="">300.00 </span><span style="">a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his answer, the
petitioner claimed that the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>, with the exception of <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span>
and Ana <span class="SpellE">Bocase</span>, had already sold their rights over
the land covered by O.C.T. No. 0-13 </span>to <span style="">him as early as 1941 and 1950 either through themselves or their
successors in interest, thus making him the rightful and legal owner of
approximately 27,899 square meters thereof; that he had b</span>een <span style="">in the peaceful, continuous and public
possession of the same; that there was no lien, encumbrance or adverse claim
annotated on O.C.T. No. 0-15 so that the series of sales made in his favor,
although not registered and annotated thereon, are valid and binding between
the parties, the said land not having passed to a third person; and that he had
spent no less than P5,000.00 in improving the land in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 31, 1960,
after hearing on the merits, the trial court rendered its decision ordering the
petitioner to vacate the land in question and to pay the respondents the sum of
P750.00, the value of the coconut trees the petitioner had ordered cut down;
P125.00 a month from July 10, 1958, representing the rentals collected by him
from tenants with their houses built on the questioned estate; P1,000.00 as
attorney's fees; and costs. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The trial
court's decision was anchored on the following rationale:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) to entertain petitioner's claim that he
had bought the questioned portion of the land covered by O.C.T. No. 0-15 as
shown in evidence</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> before the decree of registration was issued
would virtually re-open the cadastral proceeding in contravention of the <span class="SpellE">indefeasiblity</span> of Torrens titles; (b) the peti­tioner,
being the respondents' counsel in the land registration case, had all the
opportunity to have the questioned deeds of sale annotated on the certi­ficate
of title in connection with the cadastral case but did not do so; (c)
petitioner's failure, despite his having been respondents' counsel, to have his
adverse claim brought to the attention of the cadastral court and to have the
supposed deeds of sale annotated later are proof enough that the alleged deeds
of sale were really contracts of loan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In due course, the
petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals claiming that the trial court erred
in its appreciation of the facts and the legal aspects of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 22, 1968, the Court of Appeals
rendered its decision finding the petitioner’s</span> <span style="">claim "to the property in controversy untenable" and</span> <span style="">affirming, except for reducing to P550.00 the
value of the coconut trees the petitioner had to reimburse the respondents (it
was found that only 110 trees were felled at P5.00 per tree), the appealed judg­ment
of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, unlike the
trial court, the Court of Appeals did not resolve the question of whether the
alleged deeds of sale, </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">of the questioned land were </span><u><span style="">bona</span></u><span style=""> <u>fide</u>
purchase agreements or </span><span style="">mere
contracts of loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply noted that
"the alleged sales took place in 1940 or some years prior to the issuance
of the Original Certificate of Title No. 0-15 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> but none of the alleged deeds of sale appears to have
been annotated on said certificate of title" and from that observation,
concluded that "Under the Torrens System of regis­tration, claims and
liens of whatever character, except those mentioned by law, existing against
the land prior to the issuance of the certificate of title, are cut off by such
certificate if not noted thereon, and the certificate so issued binds the whole
world, including the government."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner in the
instant petition raises two issues, namely, (1) whether the existence of a
decree of registration is a bar to an action filed after one year from the
issuance of the decree to compel <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the
property in question, and (2) whether the alleged unrecorded deeds of sale
between the parties are binding upon them and their respective heirs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><u>1</u>. Contrary to the opinion entertained by the courts below,
the prevailing rule in this juris­diction does not bar a landowner whose
property was wrongfully or erroneously registered under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system from bringing an action, after one year from the issuance of the decree,
for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the property in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such an action does not aim or purport to re-open the registration proceeding
and set aside the decree of registration, but only to show that the person who
secured the registration of the questioned property is not the real owner
thereof.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><u>2</u>. Even if the contracts executed by the respondents and
their predecessors over the land in question in favor of the petitioner were
genuine and <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> purchase covenants, the same, however, lost
their efficacy upon the rendition of judgment and issuance of the decree of
registration in favor of the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A cadastral case is a judicial proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>
which, as such, binds the whole world.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The final judgment rendered therein is deemed to have settled the status of the
land subject thereof and, therefore, all rights or claims prior thereto, if not
noted thereon, like those of the petitioner, are deemed barred under the
principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the record sufficiently shows that the
petitioner was well aware of the existence of the cadastral case over the land
in question as he was engaged by the respondents to handle the case for them
although it was another lawyer, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suazo</span>, who
appears to have actually assisted the respondents in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it incontrovertibly appears that
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suazo</span> delivered the certificate of title to the
petitioner after the same was issued, and the petitioner remained in possession
thereof until the complaint was filed and the case was tried in the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's actuation,
himself a lawyer, under the circumstances, in not having the alleged deeds of
sale annotated in the certificate of title, if they were really sale covenants,
is certainly inexplicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing, the conclusion of the trial court that the
deeds of sale in question were mere contracts of loan, or properly speaking, a
security arrangement, is not far-fetched.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court takes cognizance of the common practice of individual money
lenders of taking physical possession of the certificate of title or other
documents evidencing ownership of real estate by the debtor to ensure his
faithful compliance with the obligation to pay the loan.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. No. 30053-R is hereby affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.6pt;">I concur and wish to add only
that while the main opinion </span>has in effect sustained the trial court's
factual findings that the so-called deeds of sale in favor of
petitioner-defendant were mere <span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">contracts of loan
or a security arrangement, which under the pre</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">vailing rule would call for requiring respondents-plaintiffs as </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">sellers to repay petitioner-creditor the amounts of
said loans as </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">a matter of law and
fairness, the non-application of such rule in </span>the case at bar is
justified by the fact that petitioner does not <span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">appear to have filed below a counterclaim, even contingently, for </span>the
repayment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such counterclaim is
of a compulsory <span style="letter-spacing: 0.6pt;">character and having failed
to file the same, petitioner has lost </span>the right to claim repayment.</p>
