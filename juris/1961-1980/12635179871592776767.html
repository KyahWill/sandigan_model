VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS, PLACIDA DIAZ, ENDOCIA DIAZ, MARIO DIAZ, AND
TERESITA DIAZ, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>RUIZ CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The ownership of a parcel of land, a little more than a hectare
in area, located in the municipality of San Luis, province of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, was awarded in favor of the respondents Placida, <span class="SpellE">Endocia</span>, Mario and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>, all
surnamed Diaz, by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
in cadastral case 57 of San Luis, that province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the said private respondents are
children of the original claimant, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Carlos, and
were substituted in her place, upon the latter's death, in the course of the
proceedings in the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other claimants to the same parcel of land are the petitioners
<span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> and Maria Asuncion, both surnamed <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Losing in
the legal battle they waged in the trial court, the <span class="SpellE">Agol­tos</span>
elevated their cause to the respondent Court of Appeals which in turn affirmed
the decision <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
case is now with us on appeal by <u>certiorari</u><span style=""> by </span>the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">A brief recital of the common genealogy of the litigants should
complete the entire picture of this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Servando</span> <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>, who
is the deceased father of the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> and
Maria Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>, had three sisters, namely, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>, Lucia, and <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span>,
likewise all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> and
Lucia died without issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> had three sons, Juan, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>,
and Gregorio, all surnamed Carlos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Carlos (substitu­ted in this case by her children, the
respondents Diaz) was Juan's daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gregorio was survived by his son Pedro Carlos.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court of Appeals, in support of its conclu­sion
that the ownership of the land in dispute should pertain to the respondents
Diaz, relied on (a) the deed of partition dated <st1:date year="1934" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1934</st1:date>, and (b) acquisitive prescription <span style="">in </span>favor of the respondents Diaz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both matters are the subject of the present
appellate review.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent appellate
court gave full credit to the deed of partition entered into on <st1:date year="1934" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1934</st1:date> by and between the
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> and Maria Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span> on the one hand, and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Carlos, Pedro Carlos, and the mother of the respondents Diaz (<span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Carlos) on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The deed recites that the several parcels of land therein mentioned were
inherited by the parties from their ascendants, and that they were now agreed
to apportion these parcels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot 3051 of
the San Luis ca­dastre, which is admittedly the land now under litigation, was
adjudicated, in that instrument of partition, to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Carlos, to his nephew Pedro Carlos, and to his niece <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Carlos.</p>

<p class="BODY">While no evidence appears on record, it seems clearly assumed by
the parties that both <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> and Pedro Carlos had
assigned or transferred their rights over lot 3051 to <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Car­los, the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents Diaz.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted, however, that while the name of the peti­tioner
Maria Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span> was included in the deed of
parti­tion adverted to above, she did not actually participate in its execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed itself reveals this fact as it
declares that illness or some other unavoidable circumstance caused the ab­sence
of petitioner Maria Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Added to this reci­tal, however, is a
statement that she was to be represented by her brother, the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>, and that moreover
her husband <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> de Castro, whose signature
appears on the instrument, was to bear witness to the execution of the
instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners insist nevertheless, and we agree with them, that
the deed of partition of March 11, 1934 is not binding upon the petitioner
Maria Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No written power of attorney in favor of her
brother <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> was presented nor was any pretension
made as to its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respon­dents
Diaz offered no proof that the deed of partition was subsequently ratified by
the absent party.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It was therefore error on the part of the respondent appellate court to rely
upon this ins­trument as a basis for adjudicating, as it did, the ownership of
the land in question, more so when the respondents Diaz them­selves, in their
brief, appear to be hesitant in invoking this deed of partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This instrument, according to them, was
intended by the parties thereto merely to confirm in writing the division of
ownership then already existing among them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the respondents Diaz predicate their claim to own­ership
basically on acquisitive prescription in their favor.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court of Appeals found that
even prior to March 11, 1934, the date when the deed of partition was exe­cuted,
the respondents predecessor-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Carlos, had already been in possession of the land in dispute and had been
paying the irrigation fees thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
likewise declared that upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Carlos, the respondents Diaz assumed and carried forward the possession as her
heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners assail the correctness of the respondent court's
conclusion that lot 3051 belongs to the respondents Diaz by virtue of
acquisitive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It behooved us
therefore to scrutinize the record to determine whether there was indeed a
grave misapprehension of facts on the part of the respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro Carlos testified that lot 3051 was among several parcels of
land previously held and owned in common by the bro­ther and sisters <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> and Lucia, all sur­named <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These properties were subsequently
apportioned among their surviving heirs, and it was in the year 1914 that <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Carlos, the respondents Diaz' mother, took possession
of lot 3051 as her share in the partition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pilar's</span> possession conti­nued until her death
on April 26, 1950 when her heirs, the res­pondents Diaz, forthwith took
over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>, a witness for the respondents Diaz, testified that
since 1925, when he started cultivating lot 3051 as tenant thereof, he has been
delivering the landowner's share of the harvest to <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Carlos whose owner­ship has, to his knowledge, never been doubted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Joaquin Diaz, <span class="SpellE">Pilar's</span>
husband, testified that even prior to his marriage to <span class="SpellE">Pi­lar</span>,
the latter had all along been recognized in their <u>barrio</u> as the sole
owner of lot 3051.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibits submitted by
the respon­dents Diaz show that the irrigation fees over the land were paid by
either <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> or her uncle <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Carlos.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>, upon the other hand, tes­tified that lot 3051 was
part of a bigger parcel of land which he, together with the other petitioner,
Maria Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>, inhe­rited from their father, <span class="SpellE">Servando</span> <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners were still of tender age when
their parents died, and they had to be placed, together with their properties,
under the care of their aunt <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners came to know that lot 3051 belonged to them because their
relatives, including <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span>, had told them so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> died,
her son <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> request­ed the petitioners to allow
him to cultivate the land in order to help him tide over his financial
difficulties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners granted
the request upon the condition that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> was to
pay the fees and taxes on the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>,
together with <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> de Castro, the husband of
petitioner Ma­ria Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Agolto</span>, in addition,
disowned the deed of partition of <st1:date year="1934" day="11" month="3">March
 11, 1934</st1:date> as having been procured through fraud and
misrepresentation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, the petitioners press the argument that the actual
possession enjoyed by the predecessor-in-interest of the respondents Diaz was
consistent with the petitioners' position that lot 3051 was being held by the
Carlos family only in trust for the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trust agreement, it is argued, stays the
running of the statute of limitations and bars every form of ac­quisitive
prescription in favor of the trustee until that trust is repudiated openly and
positively and brought home to the know­ledge of the <span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>que</u></span> <u>trust</u> or beneficiary.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we concede to the petitioners the validity of the legal
implications drawn by them,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
we cannot say the same with respect to their factual premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The possession credited by the respondent
Court of Appeals, and the trial court for that matter, to the
predecessor-in-interest of the respondents Diaz was, to all intents and
purposes, possession in the concept of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the possession which the
peti­tioners attribute to <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Carlos is possession
by a trustee for the benefit of a <span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>que</u></span> <u>trust</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One necessarily contradicts the other, and both cannot co-exist in a
common factual setting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
therefore, when opposing litigants present conflict­ing evidence for these two
kinds of possession, there arises the need of assessing the credibility or the
witnesses and the proba­bility or improbability of the conflicting situations
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This the trial court and the
Court of Appeals did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
dismissed the petitioners' evidence on the point as unten­able; and the
respondent Court of Appeals agreed, declaring the preponderance of evidence in
favor of the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­cause in
our review of the record, we have found no substantial reason on which to base
a disagreement with the findings thus made, we are loath to discredit the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, we find more than adequate basis <span style="">in </span>the record for sustaining the ownership of the respondents
Diaz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their mo­ther, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Carlos, acquired lot 3051 by inheritance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her pos­session, which began in the year 1914, or, at the very least, in
1925, was in the concept of ownership, adverse, public, peaceful and
uninterrupted, and lasted until <st1:date year="1941" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1941</st1:date> when the pe­titioners filed their adverse claim in the
cadastral proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, she
must be adjudged the owner of lot 3051 by or­dinary acquisitive prescription.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners raise one other issue which, although not
directed at the merits of the case, deserves our attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They roundly assail the decision of the
respondent Court of Ap­peals for not meeting head-on the several factual and
legal is­sues posed in that court, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of these
issues having been ela­borately discussed in their brief, reiterated in their
memoran­dum, and insisted upon in their motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perceptive reading of the decision in question indeed imparts
the impression that the same is a more or less re­hashed version of the
decision of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
reciting virtually the same facts as those shaped out by the trial court, the
respondent appellate court's decision proceeded to enume­rate the petitioners'
assignments of error, and then ended with an unadorned statement that they are
all without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may indeed be that a good measure of time and effort on the
part of the respondent Court of Appeals went into its stu­dy of this case and
that the conclusion it reached is fully justi­fiable, but we find its decision
wanting in full exposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">All judges must needs remember, and this we stress once again,
that courts of justice find warrant in what they do only to the extent that
their decisions rest on reason that is the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not so naive as to put our faith wholly in articula­ted
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We know that a great deal more
is caught up in a judge's mental processes than his opinion reveals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We know how slender a reed reason is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, it is only to the extent that a judge
strives to expose fully and clearly the reasons for his de­cision that he
fulfills his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decisions that are
well-written and well-argued go a long <span style="">way </span>toward minimizing appeals and promoting
public understanding of and faith <span style="">in </span>the
actions, man­dates and judgments of courts of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REYES, J.B.L. <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the opinion but believe it opportune to emphasize here
that Section 33 (paragraph 2), Judiciary Act, as amended, explicitly requires
that –</p>

<blockquote>"Every decision of the Court of
Appeals <u>shall</u> contain <u>complete</u> findings on <u><span style="">all issues</span></u><span style=""> </span>properly raised before it." (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the Court of Appeals may deem discussion of some issues
properly raised before it to be unnecessary because of the conclusions already
reached, that does not excuse compliance with the categorical imperatives of
the statute, which were evidently made to avoid possible remands for more
complete findings in case the Supreme Court should deem it essential that the
issues skipped by the appellate Court <span style="">in
its </span>decision should be resolved in furtherance of justice.</p>
