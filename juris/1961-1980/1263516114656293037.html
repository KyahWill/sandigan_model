				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">We treat here of a petition for certiorari with pre­liminary
injunction instituted by the Reparations Commis­sion (to be referred to simply
as REPACOM) which seeks to annul and set aside certain orders issued by the
respondent Judge Jesus <span class="SpellE">Morfe</span> of the Court of First
Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 55689.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon giving due course to the petition, <span class="GramE">We</span>
issued a restraining order against res­pondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the questions for determination here do not touch on the
merits of said Civil Case No. 55689 because they are procedural in nature, yet
they cannot be proper­ly comprehended without a reference to the following
events which form the background facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1958</st1:date>,
private respondent Industrial Chemicals, Inc., applied to REPACOM to procure equipment
and machineries by means of reparations for a Soda Ash Plant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application was given due course and
respondent was able to procure in advance from REPACOM, <span class="SpellE">equipmentworth</span>
$159,942.00 chargeable against the total amount to be ul­timately determined
for its Soda Ash Plant project.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1960</st1:date>,
REPACOM submitted to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
thru the National Economic Council, the Tentative Reparations Schedule for the
5th Reparations Year,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which carried a Soda Ash Plant item worth $6,500,000.00 for respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National Economic Coun­cil reduced this
item considerably but the President res­tored it to its original amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">The President then forwarded, on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1960</st1:date>, to respondent a copy of the approved
Tentative Schedule for the 5th Reparations Year wherein its Soda Ash Plant pro­ject
had a $6,500,000.00 allocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1961</st1:date>, respondent and REPACOM
signed the contract to purchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following day, <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1961</st1:date>,
REPACOM was notified by the Reparations Mission in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that the Japanese Govern­ment had accepted the tentative schedule as the Agreed
Schedule for the 5th Reparations Year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, how­ever, by agreement between the two governments, the
same was <span class="SpellE">redesignated</span> as the Agreed Schedule for the
6th Repa­rations Year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1961</st1:date>
also, REPACOM issued Resolution No. 437 authorizing the procurement of
machineries and equip­ment for respondent worth $300,000.00, and Procurement
Order No. 10, was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1961</st1:date>,
Republic Act 3079 was approved and took effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This law amended the existing Reparations Act, Republic Act 1789, by
adding new requirements for reparations applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, Civil Case No. 866 was instituted
in the Court of First Instance of Ma­nila<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to prevent REPACOM from issuing the requisite pro­curement orders for those
items included in the 5th Year Tentative Schedule but which had not been
recommended by the National Economic Council.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The preliminary injunction sought for therein was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since its Soda Ash Plant item was among those involved in Civil
Case No. 48661, respondent had to seek interven­tion therein which was granted
on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="4">April
 11, 1962</st1:date>, the lower court lifted the preliminary in­junction
insofar as Industrial Chemicals was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prior to this date, however, or on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1961</st1:date>, RE­PACOM had issued Resolution No. 557
approving an additional allocation for $4,200,000.00 to Industrial Chemicals
out of its $6,500,000.00 allocation in the Agreed Schedule for the 6th
Reparations Year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1962</st1:date>,
judgment on the merits was rendered in Civil Case No. 48661.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as Industrial Chemicals was affected,
the trial court made permanent the lifting of the preliminary injunction as
against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the adversely
affected reparations end-users therein, however, went on certiorari to the
Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
We ruled in that case, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that
the new requirements introduced by Republic Act 3079 <u>are not retroactive</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, going back again, certain correspondence transpired
between respondent Industrial Chemicals and RE­PACOM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1962</st1:date>, the former requested from the latter that the machineries
already delivered be used in the meanwhile in connection with a separate
project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked to specify what the
separate project was, Indus­trial Chemicals replied, on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>, that some <span class="GramE">machineries</span>
will be used in a light metal shop while the dump trucks and tractors will be
used for construction pur­poses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1963</st1:date>,
Industrial Chemicals reiterated its petition to use the machineries and
equipment already delivered for a separate project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also stated in its letter that if the Soda
Ash Plant is to be acquired at the free market rate of exchange of the U.S.
dollar, then it would no longer be interested in continuing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply to this, REPACOM issued Resolution
No. 140 on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="2">Februa­ry 27, 1964</st1:date>,
approving Industrial Chemicals' request only as to the barrel making machinery
and machine shop equip­ment but authorizing the repossession of the tractors
and dump trucks.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 23, 1964, respondent again wrote to REPACOM this time
requesting that the balance of its reparations allocation for the Soda Ash
Plant Project be included in the Schedule for the 9th Reparations Year
(1964-1965) and then, that the same be fully implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>REPACOM replied on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1964</st1:date>, stating that the request could
not be considered unless Industrial Chemicals was willing to pro­ceed with its
project on the free market rate of exchange, and subject to other financial,
legal and technical re­quirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1964</st1:date>, REPACOM again sought
from Industrial Chemicals a <span class="SpellE">categoric</span> commitment on
whether or not it was willing to pay for its project at the free mar­ket rate
of exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Industrial Chemicals
finally replied on <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1964</st1:date>
that for purposes of the inclusion of its remaining allocation balance in the
9th Reparations Year Schedule, it was willing to do so, but subject to whatever
decision the courts will render on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Industrial Chemicals then sought intervention in Civil Case No.
55689 before the Court of First Instance of Manila<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which had been instituted on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="12">December
 5, 1963</st1:date> by several reparations end-users seeking to prevent REPACOM
from imposing the free market rate of exchange of the U.S. dollar. Over <span class="SpellE">REPACOM's</span> objection, the lower court on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="7">Ju­ly 6, 1965</st1:date> allowed the intervention
and the corresponding complaint-in-intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>REPACOM then filed its answer thereto, and
subsequently, its opposition to the issuance of preliminary injunction sought
by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court sustained
the opposition and refused to issue preli­minary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1966</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered its decision in Civil Case No. 55689 sustaining the
plaintiffs and plaintiff-in-intervention Industrial Chemicals. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>With particular reference to the latter, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision recites:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="3">March
 3, 1966</st1:date>, the lower court issued the writ of permanent mandatory and
preventive in­junction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>REPACOM sought
an urgent reconsideration and/or stay of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Sustaining the opposition
thereto, the lower court on.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1966</st1:date> denied <span class="SpellE">REPACOM's</span> motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition questioning the lower court's off orders
dated (1) July 6, 1965, permitting Industrial Chemicals to intervene in Civil
Case No. 55689; (2) March 2, 1966, amending the decision rendered therein; (3)
April 1, 1966, denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration and/or stay of
execution; and also the writ of permanent mandatory and preventive injunction
dated March 3, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is submitted <u>first</u>
that the lower court acted without jurisdiction in amending its decision; <u>second</u>,
that it gravely abused its discretion in ordering immediate exe­cution thereof,
and <u>third</u>, that it gravely erred in al­lowing Industrial Chemicals to
intervene.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first proposition, petitioner as­serts that
Civil Case No. 55689 is really a special civil action for prohibition and
mandamus where a record on ap­peal is unnecessary to <span class="GramE">effect</span>
an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner is exempt
from filing an appeal bond, it is contended that the appeal had already been
perfected even as early as the filing of the notice of appeal on February 16,
1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find this untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegations of the basic complaints and
of respondent's complaint-in-intervention<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
un­mistakably entitle them as ordinary actions for preven­tive and mandatory
injunctions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically, the common cause
of action in Civil Case No. 55689 is specific per­formance. Moreover, the
constitutive averments of prohi­bition and mandamus are conspicuously
absent.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the more telling blow
against petitioner is its own admission in the very petition that its appeal
has not yet been per­fected and its record on appeal is still pending approval
in the court below.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second point, the course of action adopted by the lower
court was actually only in compliance with the express directive in Rule 39,
Sec. 4 of the Rules of Court providing for the immediate execution of judgments
rendered in injunction cases notwithstanding the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this, no special
reason need even be invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the
trial court could also stay immediate execution <u>in its discretion</u>, its
refusal to do so in this instance has not been clearly established by petitio­ner
to amount to grave abuse thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">That respondent Industrial Chemicals abandoned its Soda Ash Plant
Project is not clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were so, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot understand why REPACOM did not reject outright the
<span class="SpellE">former's</span> requests for the inclusion of its project in
the 9th Reparations Year Schedule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand it is on record that REPACOM considered the utilization of the
machineries already delivered in connection with another project by respondent
as merely temporary.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
While in one of its earlier letters to REPACOM respondent ex­pressed
unwillingness to proceed 4th its project under the free market rate of
exchange,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
yet its letter of Aug­ust 21, 1964 shows that respondent had changed its stand
and was quite willing to pay on the basis of the free mar­ket rate but subject
to the final court decision on the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the fears expressed by petitioner as to the possible
effects resulting from an immediate execu­tion of the judgment rendered are
without basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man­datory injunction
issued will not go beyond the status quo but will only strengthen the
pre-existing relationship bet­ween REPACOM and respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter's Soda Ash Plant allocation had
already been included in the Agreed Schedule for the 6th Reparations Year and
had even been par­tially executed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent merely seeks to complete the execution thereof which had
already stood considerable de­lays for causes beyond its <span class="GramE">control</span>.
Neither will imme­diate execution necessarily render the main case moot and
bring about untold complications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
as clarified by the lower court,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
its judgment does not require REPACOM to immediately procure the machineries
and equipment needed but only to take the necessary preliminary steps to fully
implement the remaining balance of respondent's approved allocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these steps consist in merely submitting
the requisite recommendations to higher authorities, then such action would
already constitute compliance with the court directive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine Government then stands in no
way definitely committed to the Japanese Government as to any particular
equipment or machineries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the order of the lower court would not vio­late Republic
Act 3079 which has imposed new and additio­nal requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, this Court has all read
held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bothelho</u></span><u> Shipping Corp. v. Hon.
Jose <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Leuterio</span></span></u><span class="GramE">,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
that</span> the new and additional requirements imposed not apply to
allocations approved before the passage of Republic Act 3079 on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the last point <span class="GramE">raised</span>, suffice it
to say that the propriety of the complaint-in-intervention more pro­perly
pertains to the merits of the main case, to be taken up in the appeal proper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for lack of merit, the petition is hereby
dismissed and the restraining order heretofore issued set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
