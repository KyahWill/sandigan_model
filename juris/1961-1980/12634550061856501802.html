				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila dismissing the petition for mandamus (Civil Case No. 53514)
seeking to order the respondents to cause the City of Manila to pay petitioner
and other members of the Uniformed Force Division of the Manila Fire Depart­ment
(MFD) for overtime services rendered from Jan­uary 1, 1962, up to the date when
the petition was filed January 4, 1963; to enforce immediately the <span style="">40-Hour a Week Law to petitioner and said
other members of the MFD; and to pay damages sustained by them </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">consequence of the </span><span style="">acts </span><span style="">complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts of the case are
set forth in the stipu­lation of facts submitted by the parties in the lower
court, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1. Under Sec. 15
of the Revised Charter of the City of M<span style="">anila
(Rep. Act 409, as amended), 'there shall be </span>a chief of the Fire
Department, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>who shall have the <span style="">manage­ment </span>and control of <span style="">all
matters re­lating </span>to the administration of said department, and the
organization, government, discipline, and <u><span style="">disposi­tion of </span>fire forces</u>; x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span style="">x' /</span></span><span style="">Underscoring provided/<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. Pursuant to
the foregoing provision, from September 16, 1957, to the present, the
petitioner and other members of the Uniformed Force Division of the Manila Fire
Depart­ment have been required and ordered by the Chief of the Manila Fire De­partment,
upon approval of the City Mayor, the Commissioner of <span style="">the Civil Service and the Office of the Presi­dent, to be 24 </span>hours
on duty and 24 hours off duty, alternately; that <span style="">is, </span><span style="">a </span>member of the
MFD Uniformed Force <span class="SpellE">Dviision</span> reports <span style="">to </span>his station at 8:00 o'clock in the
morning and con­tinues on duty until 8:00 o'clock of the following morning for
24 hours; <span style="">he is then off duty for the
next 24 hours immediately thereafter; this schedule </span>continuous
throughout the days of the week regardless of Satur­days, Sundays and holidays;
for an average of eighty-four (84) <span style="">hours
a week the firemen stay at the station and while there, their duties are to
clean and maintain the station, fire engines or apparatuses and equipments, to
respond to fire and </span>to perform other duties required by <span style="">ordinances and laws; during the 24 hours'
stay </span>in the station,<span style=""> unl</span>e<span style="">ss </span>they are out working to fight and
extinguish fires, the firemen are given time to rest from 12:00 o'clock noon to
4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, and time to sleep from 9:00 o’clock in the
evening <span style="">to 6:00 o'clock </span>the
following morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 10, 1957, the Chief of the Manila Fire
Department requested the Office of the President of the Philippines for
authority, in the interest of the service, for <span style="">the members </span>of the Uniformed Force Division and of the Fire Alarm
and Radio Division of the department to render service without overtime pay
beyond the 40-hour 5 day – a week requirement of the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. On December 9,
1962, a petition was addressed to the Mayor, City of Manila, through the Chief,
Fire Department, Manila, claiming payment for overtime services rend­ered
effective January 1, 1962 and demanding the enforcement of the 40 - hour a week
work law with respect to the Uniformed Force Division of the Manila <span style="">Fire </span>Department, and <span style="">the reply thereto was that services rendered </span><span style="">beyond </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">regular period fixed
by R.A. No. 1880 will not entitle the </span><span style="">em­ployee </span><span style="">to overtime pay
as a matter of legal right, citing Opinion N</span><span style="">o. </span><span style="">218, </span><span style="">Series </span><span style="">of 1957, of the Secretary </span><span style="">of Justice.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On
December 26, 1962, peti­tioner addressed a </span>petition <span style="">to </span>His Excellency, the President of
the Philippines, petitioning also the latter to order the City of Manila to pay
petitioner and other <span style="">members of </span>the
MFD Uniformed Force Division for overtime services rendered <span style="">during 1962 and caused to be enforced the
40-hour a week law and there was no favorable reply.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

should </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">necessity <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>
arise."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No additional evidence
was submitted thereafter, and upon the foregoing stipulation of facts and the
law applicable thereon, the lower court dismissed the pe­tition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue for adjudication <span style="">is </span>whether the peti­tioner-appellant and
other <span style="">firemen </span>similarly situated
are entitled to collect overtime pay for overtime ser­vices rendered by them
since <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions of law that resolve the issue are neither those of
Republic Act <span style="">1880, </span>otherwise,
known <span style="">as </span>the Forty-Hour Week
Work Law, nor Commonwealth Act 444, <span style="">the
</span>Eight-Hour Labor Law, as suggested by the peti­tioner-appellant, but the
following sections of the <span style="">Revised Administrative </span>Code, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 566. <u>Extension of hours and requirement of overtime
work</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the interests of the
public service so require, the head of any Depart­ment, Bureau, or Office may <span style="">extend the daily
hours </span>of labor, in what manner so ever fixed, for any or all of the
employees under him, and may likewise require any or all of them to do overtime
work not <span style="">only on </span>work days but
also on holidays."</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SEC. 259.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Inhibition
against payment of extra compensation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- In the absence of special provision, persons regularly and permanently
appointed under the Civil Service Law or whose salary, wages or emoluments are
fixed by law or regulation shall not, for any service rendered or labor done <span style="">by </span>them on holidays or for other over­time
work, receive or be paid any additional compensation; nor, <span style="">in </span>the
absence of special provision, shall any officer or employee <span style="">in </span>any
branch of the <span style="">Government service</span>
receive <span style="">additional compensation on
account of the discharge of duties pertaining to the position of another or for
the performance of any public service whatever, whether such service is
rendered voluntarily or exacted of him under authority of law.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner-appellant
contends that the above-quoted portions of the Revised Administrative Code have
been repealed by the provisions of Commonwealth Act 444, in so far as the
provisions of the former are inconsistent with the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has explicitly declared</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that the Eight-Hour Labor Law </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">not intended to apply to civil service employees who are still governed
by the above provisions of the </span><span style="">Revised Admin</span><span style="">istrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there appears
</span><span style="">to </span><span style="">be no debate over the employment of
petitioner-appellant and the other firemen similarly situated as falling under
the civil service, they being employees of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, a municipal corporation, in </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">governmental ca­pacity, We perceive no reason
to deviate from said ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">We hold that the above sections of the Revised Administrative Code are
still legally in force, it necessarily follows that Rule XV, section 3 of the </span><span style="">Civil Ser­</span><span style="">vice Rules, a similar provision promulgated
pursuant to that of Section 16 (e) of the Civil Service Act of 1959<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Republic Act No. 2260) is likewise
applicable to </span><span style="">peti­</span><span style="">tioner-appellant.
Said provision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 3. When the nature of the duties to be performed or the
in­terest of the public service so re­quires, the head of any Department or
agency may extend the daily hours <span style="">of
work specified for any or all the employees under him, and such exten­sion
shall be without additional compensation unless otherwise provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Officers and employees may be required by the
head of the Department or agency to work on Sat­urdays, Sundays and public
holidays also, without additional compensation, unless otherwise specifically
authorized by law."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It needs no lengthy explanation that the nature of work of a
fireman requires him to be always on the alert to respond to<span style=""> </span>fire
alarms which may occur at any time of the day, for the exigency of the service
necessitates a round-the-clock observance of his duties, which situation
excepts him from the applicability of Section 562 of the Revised Administrative
Code, as amended by Republic Act <span style="">1880, </span>the
Forty-Hour a Week Work Law, which provides, in part:</p>

<blockquote>"Such hours, except for schools, courts, hospitals and health
clinics <u>or where the exigencies of service so require</u>, shall be <span style="">as </span>prescribed in the Civil Service
Rules and as otherwise from time to time disposed in temporary exe­cutive
orders in the discretion of the President of the Philippines but shall be eight
(8) hours a day, for five (5) days a week or a total of forty (40) hours a
week, exclusive of the time for lunch."/Underscoring supplied/</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Parallel to the instant case are the circumstances obtaining in
Department of Public Services Labor Union <span style="">vs. </span>CIR, <span style="">et </span>al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court held that in view of the exigency of the service, garbage
collectors in Manila are not entitled to the benefits of the Forty-Hour <span style="">a </span>Week Work Law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the
foregoing, the conclusion is inevitable that the petitioner-appellant and other
fire­men of his situation are not entitled to overtime pay and to the coverage
of the said Forty-Hour a Week Work </span><span style="">Law.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Parenthetically, a side issue has come up in
this appeal during its <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>, and that </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">whether or not the City Fiscal of Manila should continue his appearance
for the respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, despite the creati</span>on
of <span style="">the office and subsequent
appointment of a City Legal Officer of Manila, pursuant to Republic Act 5185,
known as the Decentralization Act of 1957, to take charge of civil cases
concerning the City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe this is </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">the proper forum to first </span><span style="">pass u</span><span style="">pon the question
since the motion for withdrawal of appearance filed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the </span>City Fiscal and the opposition thereto put at issue the <span style="">validity </span>of an ordinance<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
passed by the City Council of Manila which is alleged to be in conflict with
the said Decentralization Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,
the said motion for withdrawal of appearance <span style="">was </span>filed only on <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="5">May 19,
