				<H3>BERNARDO LONARIA, PETITIONER, VS. JUDGE PASTOR
L. DE GUZMAN AND FORTUNATA SANTIAGO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ZALDIVAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for certiorari to review the order, dated November 26, 1962,
of the Court of Agrarian Re­lations, Judge Pastor L. de Guzman, presiding, in
CAR Case No. 60, Bulacan ‘62, ordering herein petitioned to <span style="">pay </span>additional rental of P25.00
yearly, increasing thereby the yearly rental from P200.00 to P225.00 of
petitioner's landholding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bernardo Lonaria has been an agri­cultural tenant
since 1959, on the leasehold tenancy basis, over about two hectares of
agricultural land belonging to respondent Fortunata Santiago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petition­er used to pay a yearly rental of P200.00
therefor, but sometime in January 1962 the owner informed <span style="">peti­tioner </span>that effective
immediately the rental was increased to P250.00, and that should tenant refuse
to pay he would be ejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">To protect his interests, petitioner filed, on February 15, 1962,
before the Court of Agrarian Rela­tions <span style="">a
</span>petition alleging therein that the landholding had a normal average
yearly net harvest of 30.8 cavans of palay and P65.00 worth of crops, and that
pursuant to <span style="">Section </span>46 of
Republic Act 1199, as amended, the le­gal rental should be only <span style="">7.7 </span>cavans <span style="">of </span>palay plus P16.25 a <span style="">year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Fortunata Santiago in her an­swer,
dated March 22, </span>1962, claimed that "<span style="">respondent’s </span>land is a first class land and the area cultivated
by petitioner yields 60 to 65 cavans a year." The parties entered into a
trial on November 26, 1962 wherein pe­titioner offered his evidence, while
respondent San­tiago did not submit any.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, respondent Judge issued in open court an <span style="">order, </span><span style="">the pertinent </span>portions of which read:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"It </span>appearing
that the holding yields 130 cavans a year <span style="">plus
mangoes </span>and vegetables, the amount of P25.00 increase <span style="">sought </span>for by the landholder in
addition to the <span style="">standing P200.00 </span>lease
rental is considered reasonable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, petitioner is order­ed to <span style="">pay </span>an additional amount of P25.00 or
yearly, P225.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a emotion for reconsideration, <span style="">on </span>November 28, 1962, upon the grounds
that <span style="">(1) </span>the affirmative and
special defenses of respondent were denied, and (2) the evidence adduced during
<span style="">the </span>trial was in direct
contravention to said defences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
motion for reconsideration was denied on <span style="">December
26, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A second motion for </span>reconsideration,
filled on January 22, 1963, claiming that the order of November <span style="">26, </span>1962 <span style="">had </span>no legal and factual bases and, hence, illegal, was Likewise
denied on February 9, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that the decision was not supported by the evidence and
that it was contrary to the provision of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, the
instant <span style="">peti­</span>tion was filed
before this Court, praying that the decision appealed from be set aside and
that the issue be resolved on the basis of the evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Fortunata Santiago filed April 1, 1933 <span style="">a </span>motion to dismiss upon the
principal ground that the period for the filing of the notice of ap­peal had
expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court by resolution dated
June 13, 1963 considered the motion to dismiss as respond­ent's answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 8, 1963, however, respondents filed
their "Answer" denying petitioner's allegation that less than
one-half of the landholding <span style="">was </span>devoted
to the cultivation of palay, and likewise justifying the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the requirement regarding the
perfections of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory
but also jurisdictional, and the failure to appeal on time has the effect of
rendering final the judgment of the court, the resolu­tion of the motion to
dismiss filed by respondent on April 1, 1963 upon the ground that the appeal
was not perfected on time must be given preferential attention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4 of Rule 43 of the Rules of Court pro­vides that appeals
front an order, ruling or decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations shall be
brought in <span style="">a </span>period of 15 days
from notice of such ruling, or­der or decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was the instant appeal perfected within said reglementary period?</p>

<p class="BODY">From the petitioner's opposition to the motion to dismiss, it
appears that:</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 26, 1962, the order appealed from was dictated in
open court;</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 28, 1962, the first motion for re­consideration was
filed;</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 4, 1963, petitioner's counsel re­ceived the court's
resolution dated December 26, 1962 denying the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this same day, counsel for peti­tioner
filed two motions, to wit: (1) motion to fur­nish petitioner with copy of the
order of November 26, 1962, and (2) motion to suspend period for finality of
the order;</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 18, 1963, petitioner's counsel re­ceived a copy of the
order subject of the present ap­peal;</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 22, 1963, counsel for petitioner filed his second
motion for reconsideration;</p>

<p class="BODY">On February <span style="">21, 1963,
counsel for </span>petitioner received copy of the order dated February 11,
1963 denying second motion for reconsideration;</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 22, 1963, the instant appeal was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Records, pp. 34-35)</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the appeal was perfect­<span style="">ed on </span>time because only 7 or 5 days
were consumed - seven days only, even if the period be counted from November
26, 1962, because <span style="">from </span>November
26 to Novem­ber 28, there were only 2 days; from January 18 to Jan­uary 22,
there were only 4 days; and from February 21, 1963 to February 22, 1963 only
one day; hence a total of seven days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the period of <span style="">appeal
</span><span style="">is </span>to be count­ed from receipt of a copy of
the decision which <span style="">in this </span>case
was January 18, 1963, only a total of five days was consumed, because from
January 18, 1963 to January 22, 1963, only 4 days transpired; and from February
<span style="">21 </span>to February 22, <span style="">only one (1) day (Records, pp. 34-35).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From what date should </span>the
period of appeal be counted in the instant case?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When petitioner <span style="">filed his </span><span style="">first motion for reconsideration on November 28, </span><span style="">1962, he certainly had knowledge of </span><span style="">the order </span><span style="">appealed from</span>, otherwise there was no
basis for his motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This s <span style="">evident from </span><span style="">the </span>preliminary statement in his
motion <span style="">for </span><span style="">reconsideration </span>which
cited the dispositive portion of the order of the Court of Agrarian Relations,
stating:</p>

<blockquote>"The order sought to be reconsidered <span style="">states </span>that the petitioner is <span style="">to </span><span style="">pay a </span>rental to respondent in <span style="">the am</span>ount of P225.00 per year <span style="">for the use of </span>the land holding si­tuated
in Valenzuela, Bulacan."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By filing said motion, he waived his right to the period of
appeal counted from receipt of order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reasons for the rule requiring that the period or appeal be counted
from notice of the order or decision are, first, in order that the period may
not commence <span style="">to </span><span style="">run </span><span style="">until </span>the party concerned has
opportunity <span style="">to </span><span style="">take the steps he </span><span style="">may deem </span>proper in view <span style="">of the order </span><span style="">or decision, which steps he cannot </span><span style="">take unless he has </span><span style="">knowledge of the
order or decision, which knowledge he </span>acquires usually only upon receipt
of a copy thereof; <span style="">and </span>second,
so that the commencement of the period for <span style="">the appeal may </span>not be uncertain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These two purposes <span style="">have already
been fulfilled when petitioner filed his first motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is then no reason to say that in this
case the period of appeal should commence to run from the date he received a
copy, of the order on January 18, 1963, because settled in law is the maxim: </span><u><span style="">cessante ratione
legis,</span></u><span style=""> <u>cessat et ipsa lex</u>, </span><span style="">"where the reason of the law ceases, the law itself </span><span style="">ceases.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The period for appeal
should, therefore, commence from the filing of the first motion for
reconsideration, that is, on November 28, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this period was </span><span style="">im­mediately </span><span style="">suspended by the filing of the motion, notice of denial of which he
received on January 4, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His filling</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">on the same date the motion to suspend the
finality of the order did not </span><u><span style="">ipso</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facto</span></u><span style=""> suspend the running of the period from said
date, for even petitioner himself does not claim that such motion was ever
granted. Petitioner filed the second motion for reconsideration only on January
22, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From January 4 to January 22,
1963, already 18 days had lapsed, more than the 15 days allowed for appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the second motion on January
22, 1963 did not suspend the running of the period, first because it was <u>pro</u></span><span style=""> <u>forma</u> </span><span style="">based on grounds already existing at the time
of the first motion; and second, because there was no more period to suspend,
as the period had already lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 4 of Rule 14 of the Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The filing of the motion for reconsidera­tion shall stay the
execution of the order or decision sought to be reconsidered and shall suspend
the running of the period within which the appeal to the Supreme Court must be
perfect­ed; Provided, however, That a <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> motion <span style="">for reconsideration which is a reiteration of
a first motion or is founded on <span style="">a </span>ground
avail­able at the time of the filing of such first motion will not interrupt
the period of appeal."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, this case must be
dismissed for having been appealed beyond the reglementary period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Having arrived at the
foregoing conclusion, </span><span style="">We </span><span style="">do not consider it necessary to discuss the other points raised by
petitioner in this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the petition for certiorari is dis­missed,
and the order of respondent Court of Agrarian Relations of November 26, 1962 is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronounce­ment as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
