<p class="BODY">The Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc. appealed to the Workmen's
Compensation Commission and contended that:</p>

<blockquote>"The claimant is not entitled to compensation
benefit as he voluntarily stopped working upon attaining normal retirement age;"
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming that he has a cause of
action against the respondent, he miserably failed to prove the causal connection
between his employment and his alleged illness."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission found that on the day the
claimant, petitioner herein, stopped working, he was not suffering from any
disabling illness and that his employment was merely terminated because he was
already sixty (60) years old and his separation from his work was in accordance
with the collective bargaining agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Officer of Regional Office No. 5 at <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> found on <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1974</st1:date> that the claimant had suf­fered
temporary total disability for labor for 183 days by reason of PTB minimal
which supervened during the em­ployment of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There arises a presumption that the claim is
compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

this Court said:</p>

this Court held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> assuming the employee's
illness may be ruled out as an occupational disease or that the causal link
between the nature of his employment and his ailment has been insufficiently
shown, nevertheless, it is to be presumed as mandated by Section 44 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, that the employee's illness which supervened during his
employment either arose out of, or at least aggravated by said employment and
with this presumption, the burden of proofs shifts to the employer and the
employee is relieved of the burden to show causation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case before <span class="GramE">Us</span>,
the respondent has failed to discharge that burden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the respondent, Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc., did
not controvert the claim for compensation within the period provided by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, said respondent has lost its
right to controvert the right to compensation of petitioner except on
jurisdictional grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, in addition to the compensation benefits granted
him, is entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses supported by proper
receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside
and the respondent, Blue Bar Coconut Philippines, Inc., is ordered:</p>
