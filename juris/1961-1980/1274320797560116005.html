				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 15, 1961, a prosecutor of respondent court filed a complaint
for unfair labor practice against petitioners in behalf of some
employees alleging that said petitioners failed to classify the
complainants as permanent employees notwithstanding their more than 20
years of service for the reason that they are members of respondent
union and had committed other acts of discrimination against them.
These acts are: that the railroad company refused to comply with
certain stipulation contained in the collective bargaining agreement
entered into between the company and the union because of complainants'
affiliation and union activities; and that petitioners refused to grant
complainants a privilege pass each because they were going to Manila to
see their union president to complain about their present employment
status.
<p>Petitioners filed an answer denying the material averments of the
complaint and setting up the following defenses: the complainants were
merely casual or temporary laborers who do not work continuously for a
period of six months; their services were merely subject to the needs
of the company and as such did not warrant their conversion to
permanent employees; petitioners were not aware of the affiliation or
union activities of complainants; complainants are not entitled to
privilege passes inasmuch as they are not regular employees of the
company; the complaint was premature for having been filed contrary to
the collective bargaining agreement entered into between complainants
and petitioners which sets a procedure to be complied with before a
complaint of this nature could be filed in court; and complainant has
no legal personality to file this complaint because the Benguet Auto
Line Employees' Union is the sole and exclusive bargaining
representative that could represent them for the purpose of collective
bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment,
and other related subjects.</p>
<p>After due hearing, his Honor Baltazar M. Villanueva, Associate
Judge, rendered decision finding petitioners guilty of unfair labor
practice as charged, and ordering them to accord permanent status to
complainants as bus workers or truck helpers, thereby placing them in
the roll of permanent employees. In due time, petitioners filed a
motion to reconsider alleging, among others, that the decision is
contrary to law and the evidence, and when the motion was denied by the
court en bane in an split resolution, petitioners interposed the
present petition for review.</p>
<p>As found by the respondent court, the complainants were pre-war
employees of the Benguet Auto Lines, being either bus washers or truck
helpers. They entered the service of said company since 1032, but
despite the fact that they served the company for more than 20 years
their status as casual laborers has never been changed in spite of the
repeated requests made by them or by the union to which they are
affiliated. Respondent court expressed the view that since these
complainants were holding positions which do not need any civil service
eligibility nor any special educational qualification for the work they
are performing, no reason is seen why they could not be given a
permanent appointment as authorized by Article XI of f;he collective
bargaining agreement entered into between the complainant union and the
Manila Railroad Company on December 23, I960, even if they received
their back pay before and during the enemy occupation. The only reason
that can be advanced for such indifferent attitude towards them is the
fact that they are affiliated with the complainant union which
apparently does not have the sympathy of their employer.</p>
<p>We find this observation of respondent court well taken considering
that the complainants are pre-war employees and that notwithstanding
their length of service without any indication that they had committed
any improper act or behavior that may render them unfit or inefficient,
they have never been given any permanent status to give them some
feeling of security in their employment in spite of the fact that
others who entered the service merely in 1957 or 1959 in the same
capacity as bus workers or truck helpers were readily given the status
of permanency thereby showing the discrimination committed against
complainants. And it is not correct to claim, as petitioners do, that
the complainants could not be extended permanent appointments because
of the absence of vacant and existing positions commensurate with their
qualifications in petitioners' budget and plantilla, for, as the
evidence shows; during the period of 1957 to 1959 four new employees
were taken in as bus workers or truck helpers and right from the start
they were given permanent appointments. We refer to the appointment of
Filemon Lopez as laborer on July 1, 1957, the appointment of Basilio
Leonardo as bus worker on November 1, 1959, the appointment of one
Claustro as bus worker and helper on November 1, 1959, and the
appointment of Felix Gomez as bus worker and truck helper on November
1, 1959.</p>
<p>The contention that these new employees were also members of the
union to which the complainants belong cannot justify their
discrimination for it is not difficult to see that being newcomers they
cannot have more merit, preparation and experience than complainants
who have been in the service for more than 20 years. The claim that the
complainants were not given permanent assignment because they refused
to go to Baguio does not also deserve consideration because it appears
that these complainants had precisely signed a joint manifestation
stating that they are willing to accept that assignment even if they
have to reside in Baguio provided that their appointments be made
permanent.</p>
<p>The above are the findings made by respondent court from the
evidence extant in the record, and the same has not been successfully
disputed. And it appearing that complainants were discriminated against
because of their affiliation and union activities, the charge of unfair
labor practice involved herein is justified, as found by the court <em>a quo</em>.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed. No costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes, Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
