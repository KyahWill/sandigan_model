appeal </span><span style="">from an order of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> dismissing
the above-entitled case, without costs.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that, on October 16<span style="">,</span> 1963<span style="">,</span> Joseph's <span style="">Enterprises - claiming to be a partnership
existing by virtue of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Philippine Laws - and Carmen G.
Rodriguez-Arguelles, Gregorio G. Rodriguez, <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span>
</span><span style="">G. </span><span style="">Rodriguez-<span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span>,
Alberto G. Rodriguez, and the Heirs of Pablo G. Rodriguez: namely, the minors <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Rodriguez
and Luz Rodriguez, as co-heir and guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>
of said minors, instituted </span><span style="">Civil
Case No. </span><span style="">6642 of the Court of
First Instance of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style="">, against <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> </span><span style="">A.
Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged in the complaint
therein that plaintiffs signatures on a given document - purport - </span>to be
an agreement between said plaintiffs and Mendoza, <span style="">granting </span><span style="">the latter, as
manager of the <span class="SpellE">Sariaya</span> </span><span style="">Electric and Ice Plant, belonging to said partnership </span><span style="">and the other plaintiffs, as the constituent
members </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the partnership, the right </span><span style="">"to </span><span style="">certain onerous </span><span style="">per­</span><span style="">centage </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the gross income of
plaintiffs' business" - had been either forged by Mendoza or secured by
him through fraud or deceit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs
prayed, therefore, that the supposed contract incorporated in said document be
declared “inexistent and null and void", and that Mendoza be sentenced to
pay actual and moral damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his answer</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to said complaint, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> denied the personality to sue of Joseph's
Enterprises, upon the ground that the same is merely a trade name of Rodriguez
&amp; Co., which "<span class="GramE">is</span> the owner and operator of <span class="SpellE">Sariaya</span> Electric and Ice Plant".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, likewise, denied the forgery or fraud
imputed to him, and alleged that the <span class="SpellE">Rodrigueces</span> had
knowingly given their approval to and signed the questioned document, copy of
which was attached to said answer as Annex 1, and that the complaint had been
filed for no other purpose than to harass him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mendoza prayed, therefore, that the complaint be dismissed and that he
be awarded moral, exemplary and temperate damages, in addition to attorney's
fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Months later, or on May 15, 1964, Mendoza commenced the present
action, Civil Case No. 6705 of the same court, against said Rodriguez &amp;
Co., for the recovery of P3,360.59,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>alleged balance of the compensation that Mendoza claimed to be due to
him under the document sought to be annulled by Joseph's Enterprises and the <span class="SpellE">Rodrigueces</span> in case No. 6642, "from April 14, 1948 up
to November 30, 1963, when he resigned", according to his complaint, Copy
of said document was, also, attached to Mendoza's complaint in case No. 6705,
as Annex A thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its answer to such
complaint, the defendant alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that "Joseph's Enterprises is the partn</span><span style="">ership </span><span style="">organized under
the laws of the Philippines, the name Rodriguez &amp; Co. being another name
given the said partnership”, that having “prepared the articles of co-</span>partnership
of the partnership known as Joseph Enterprises", and acting maliciously,
surreptitiously and fraudulently, Mendoza presented Annex A, together with said
Articles of Co-partnership to the <span class="SpellE">Rodrigueces</span>, as if
the former were part of the latter; that the <span class="SpellE">Rodriguezes</span>
signed both instruments in such erroneous belief; and that they owe nothing to
Mendoza, who had never demanded payment of the balance alleged to be due to him
in his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendant prayed,
therefore that the latter be dismissed, and that Mendoza be sentenced <span style="">to </span>pay damages and attorney's fees, as
well as to render an accounting.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On motion of counsel for
Joseph's Enterprises, dated July </span>25<span style="">,</span>
<span style="">1964, based upon the allegation that
said cases Nos. 6642 and 6705 "involve the same parties, subject matter and
issues'', and "without objection" on the part of Mendoza's
counsel", on July 28, 1964, the lower court ordered the consolidation of
the hearing of the two (2) cases, “in view of the fact that they involve the
same parties, the same questions of fact and the same ques­tion of law".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At said consolidated
hearing, plaintiffs in case No. 6642 (Joseph's Enterprises, et al.), and the
defend­ant in case No. 6705 (Rodriguez &amp; Co.), verbally moved, in open
court, for the dismissal of the latter case, alleging that the claim of
plaintiff therein (Mendoza) </span>is based upon the very contract relied upon
in his answer in case No. 6642, and impugned by the plaintiffs therein; that,
accordingly, the balance of the compensation allegedly due to Mendoza under
said contract, should have been set up by him by way of compulsory counterclaim
in case No. <span style="">6642; </span>and that, not
having done so, he is barred from claiming it in case No. 6705.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due hearing and the
submission of Memoranda by both parties, said court issued the order appealed
from, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, and taking into consideration
the reason behind Rule 9, Section 4, of the Rules of Court, the court finds
that the motion to dismiss filed by <span style="">counsel
for Joseph Enterprises is tenable and meritorious, hence, Civil Case No. 6705
is hereby dismissed without pronouncement as to costs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A reconsideration of this
order having been denied, Mendoza interposed the present appeal by filing his
record on appeal in case No. 6705.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
brief, Mendoza alleges that the lower court erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding that
plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 6642 have legal capacity to sue</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding that the act
of filing an answer by defendant (plaintiff-appellant) in Civil Case No. <span style="">6642 </span>is a recognition of plaintiffs'
"personality and right" to sue.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding that
plaintiff-appellant's claim for unpaid compensation in Civil Case No. 6705
should be pleaded as compulsory counterclaim in his answer <span style="">in Civil </span>Case No. 6642.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding that plaintiff-appellant
entered into a contract of services with Joseph Enterprises.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In</span> dismissing Civil
Case No. 6705.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error is clearly devoid of merit, for the
legal capacity of Joseph Enterprises to sue in Case No. <u>6642</u> is <u>not</u>
in issue in the present Case No. 6705.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the very document on which Mendoza's alleged cause of action
and complaint therein are based and on which he signed after the words:
"accepted and to be enforced <u>to the letter</u> as agreed upon" -
states <span style="">that said instrument had been
executed by "Pablo G. Rodriguez, Managing Partner of the JOSEPH'S
ENTERPRISES, a Partnership duly organized and existing under the laws of the
Philippines, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, by
virtue of the powers vested in me </span><span style="">by
</span><span style="">the 'Indenture of the Articles
of General Partnership.’”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to
the terms of this agreement, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">'s aforementioned contract had been made with
Joseph's Enterprises, "a partnership duly organized and existing under the
Laws of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, he is now in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to question the
juridical personality of Joseph's Enterprises or its right to sue him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worthy of not notice in this connection
that, according to defendant's answer in this case, said instrument was
prepared by none other than Mendoza himself, and that Mendoza has not made a
specific denial of such allegation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the second
assignment of error, suffice it to say that, even if <u>his</u> <u>answer</u>
in Case No. </span><span style="">6642 </span><span style="">had not implied an acknowledgment of Joseph's
Enterprises ac a duly registered partnership, with juridical personality to
sue, the fact is that by <u>his</u> <u>acts</u> - in drafting the document in
question and signing the same, as well in takings advantage of the benefits
derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and filing the complaint herein
based </span>thereon - he <span style="">had
recognized said personality and profited <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
and is, accordingly, in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to deny the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The third and fourth
assignments of error are predicated upon the theory that </span><span style="">Mendoza's </span><span style="">contract was entered intro with Rodriguez &amp; Co., not with Joseph's
Enterprises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">refuted, however, by the language the instruments incorporation said
alleged contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More significant still
is 'the facet that, whereas Joseph's Enterprises and the <span class="SpellE">Rodrigueces</span>
alleged that their signature thereon had been fraudulently obtained and that
they had no intention of binding themselves to pay Mendoza the compensation
therein set forth; <u>Mendoza maintains </u></span><u><span style="">that the document </span></u><u><span style="">reflects
the </span></u><u><span style="">true </span></u><u><span style="">of the parties thereto</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
can he now take, therefore, a position </span><span style="">inconsistent </span><span style="">with the
provisions hereof?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In any event, the
question whether or note Joseph's Enterprise is merely a trade name of the
partnership, Rodriguez &amp; Co., is not important in this appeal, for even if </span><span style="">Mendoza's </span><span style="">contention were hypothetically true his claim in the case at bar for
unpaid compensation allegedly due under the contract in question would still he
and is necessarily connected with the transaction that is the subject-matter of
Case No. </span><span style="">6642, </span><span style="">and, not having been set up in that case it
is barred from enforcement in the present subsequent case, pursuant to Rule 9,
Section </span><span style="">4, </span><span style="">of the Rules of Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We need not discuss the last assignment of error, it being a mere
corollary to the assignments of error already disposed of.</p>
