				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Allied Manufacturing &amp; Trading Company, Inc. imported fifteen
(15) cases of Harting voltage regulators, Purolator filters and Wipperman
timing chains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1964</st1:date>, the shipment <span style="">was </span>discharged by <span style="">SS </span><span style="">"Glen­</span>garry" unto the custody of the, Customs Arrastre
Service of the Bureau of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, only fourteen cases were later delivered to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As insurer of the shipment "against <span style="">all risks", </span>the Insurance Company
of North America paid the consignee P4,469.80 - the value of the case
lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As subrogee to the consignee, the
Insurance Company sought to recover from the Customs Arrastre Service said
amount.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Having been denied
recovery, the Insurance Company </span>of <st1:place>North <span style="">America</span></st1:place><span style=""> </span>on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1965</st1:date> filed before the City Court of <span style="">Manila </span>an action against the Republic
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">as </span>arrastre operator and the
Customs Arrastre Service as the entity through which the former operated,
praying for the recovery of P4<span class="GramE">,469.80</span> with legal
interest, attorney's fees plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The City Court <span style="">and on
appeal the </span>Court of First Ins­tance of Manila, on November 25, 1966,
ordered the defen­dants to <span style="">pay </span>plaintiff
P4,469.80 despite defendants’ al­legations of non-suability and denial of
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, <span style="">in view </span>of this Court's ruling in
Mobil <span style="">Philippines </span>Exploration,
Inc. v. Customs Arrastre Service and Bureau of Customs, L-23139, <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1966</st1:date>, declaring the
non-suability of the Customs Arrastre Service and the Bureau of Customs, the
Court of First Instance on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="1">January 7, <span style="">1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>set aside its decision of <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1966</st1:date> and dismissed the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the denial of its motion for
reconsideration, the plaintiff has appealed to Us on the ground that the <u>Mobil</u>
case is not applicable because there, only the Customs Arrastre Service and the
Bureau of Customs were declared as not suable; the Republic, a party defendant
herein, was not included in the <u>Mobil</u> suit; and ap­pellant contends that
the Republic has personality to be sued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Republic, in doing ar­raster operations through the Bureau of
Customs or the Customs Arrastre Service, performs a necessary incident of the
primary governmental function of assessment and collection from importations,
of lawful revenues, tariff and customs duties, fees, charges, fines and
penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As such, the Republic is immune from suit without its consent for said <span style="">operations.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The propriety of the application of Commonwealth Act 327
providing for money <span style="">claims </span>against
the government to be filed against the Auditor General, has already been
disposed of by Us <span style="">in an </span>extended
resolution denying <span style="">the mo</span>tion
for reconsideration, in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-26532, Insurance Company
of </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">North America</span></st1:place><span class="GramE">, v.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic, <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to appellant's concept, <span style="">claims </span>of this nature do not ap­pear
to be unliquidated, for their amounts are fixed or can fairly and easily be
determined from readily accessible papers and records of the shipments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the fact that the liability of the
Government for a liquidated claim is at issue does not alone convert said claim
into and unli­quidated one.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the dismissal order is hereby affirmed, with
costs <span style="">against appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
