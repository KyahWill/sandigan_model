<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal taken by 
the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Trading Company from the decision of the 
Court of Appeals affirming the one rendered by the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> in Civil Case No. 13772, dismissing its 
complaint.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 4, 1958, appellant 
commenced the action mentioned above against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Macam</span>, praying that 
it be declared that it be declared owner of one-eighth portion of the land 
described in paragraph 2 of the complaint; that a partition of the whole 
property be made; that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> be ordered to pay it 
the amount of P500.00 a year as damages from 1958 until said portion is 
delivered, plus attorney's fees and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Answering the complaint, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> alleged, in the main, that Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron's</span> share in the property described in the complaint, as 
well as that of all his coheirs, had been acquired by purchase by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> since June 19 and September 21, 1955, before the 
issuance of the original certificate of title in their name; that at the time 
levy in execution was made on Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron's</span> share 
therein, the latter had no longer any right or interest in said property; that 
appellant and its predecessor in interest were cognizant of the facts already 
mentioned; that since the sales made in his favor, he had enjoyed uninterrupted 
possession of the property and introduced considerable improvements therein. 
<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> likewise sought to recover damages by way of 
counterclaim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After trial upon the issue thus 
joined, the court rendered Judgment dismissing the complaint, which, on appeal, 
was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts of the case are not 
disputed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the year 1955, Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron</span> and his seven <span class="GramE">brothers</span> 
sisters were pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> owners of a parcel of 
unregistered land located in barrio <span class="SpellE">Parayao</span>, 
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Binmaley</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>. While their application for registration of said 
land under Act No. 496 was pending, they executed, on June 19 and September 21, 
1955, two deeds conveying the property to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, 
<span class="GramE">who</span> thereafter took possession thereof and proceeded to 
introduce substantial improvements therein. One month <span class="GramE">later, 
that</span> is on October 14, 1955, Original Certificate of Title No. 6942 
covering the land was issued in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Marons</span> 
free from all liens and encumbrances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 4, 1956, by virtue of a 
final judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 42216 of the Municipal Court of Manila 
against Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron</span> in favor of the Manila Trading and 
Supply Company, levy was made upon whatever interest he had in the 
aforementioned property, and thereafter said interest was sold at public auction 
to the judgment creditor. The corresponding notice of levy, certificate of sale 
and the sheriff a certificate of final sale in favor of the Manila Trading and 
Supply Co.—because nobody exercised the right of redemption—were duly 
registered. On March 1, 1958, the latter sold all its rights and title in the 
property to appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The question before us now is: 
Who has the better right as between appellant <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> 
Trading Company, on the one band, and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Macam</span>, on the other, to 
the one-eighth share of Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron</span> in the property 
mentioned heretofore?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">If the property covered by the 
conflicting sales were <u>unregistered</u> land, <span class="SpellE">Macam</span> 
Would undoubtedly have the better right in view of the fact that his claim is 
based on a prior sale coupled with public, exclusive and continuous possession 
thereof as owner. On the other hand, were the land involved in the conflicting 
transactions duly <u>registered</u> land, We would be inclined to hold that 
appellant has the better right because, as we have consistently held, in case of 
conveyance of registered real estate, the registration of the deed of sale is 
the operative act that gives validity to the transfer. This would be fatal to 
<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim, the deeds of sale executed in his 
favor by the <span class="SpellE">Marons</span> not having been registered, while 
the levy in execution and the provisional certificate of sale as well as the 
final deed of sale in favor of appellant were registered. Consequently, this 
registered conveyance must prevail although posterior to the one executed in 
favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and appellant must be deemed to 
have acquired such right, title and interest as appeared on certificate of title 
issued in favor of Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron</span>, subject to no lien, 
encumbrance or burden not noted thereon. <span class="GramE">(Anderson &amp; Co., 
vs. Garcia 64 Phil. 506; <span class="SpellE">Reynes</span> et al., vs. Barrera, 
et al., 68 Phil. 656; <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> National, etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Camus</span>, 70 Phil. 289).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The present case, however, does 
not fall within either situation. Here the sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was executed <u>before</u> the land subject matter 
thereof was registered, while the conflicting sale in favor of appellant was 
executed <u>after</u> the same property had been registered. We can not, 
therefore, decide the case in the light of whatever adjudicated cases there are 
covering the two situations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It is our 
considered view that what should determine the issue are the provisions of the 
last paragraph of Section 35, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to the effect that 
upon the execution and delivery of the final certificate of sale in favor of the 
purchaser of land sold in an execution sale, such purchaser "shall be 
substituted to and acquire all the right, title, interest and claim of the 
judgment debtor to the property as of the time of the levy". Now we ask: What 
was the interest and claim of Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron</span> on the 
one-eight portion of the property inherited by him and his co-heirs, at the time 
of the levy? The answer must necessarily be that he had none, because for a 
considerable time prior to the levy, his interest had already been conveyed to 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, "fully and irretrievably"—as the Court of 
Appeals held. Consequently, subsequent levy made on the property for the purpose 
of satisfying the judgment rendered against Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron</span> in favor of the Manila Trading Company was void and of 
no effect. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Buson</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Licauco</span> 13 Phil. 357-358; <span class="SpellE">Landig</span> 
vs. U. S. Commercial Company, 89 Phil. 638).</span> Needless to say, the 
unregistered sale and the consequent conveyance of title and ownership in favor 
of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> could not have been cancelled and rendered 
of no effect upon the subsequent issuance of the Torrens title over the entire 
parcel of land. We can not, therefore, but agree with the following statement 
contained in the appealed decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“* * *. Separate and apart from 
this, however, we believe that in the inevitable conflict between a right of 
ownership already fixed and established under the Civil Law and/or the Spanish 
Mortgage Law—which cannot be affected by any subsequent levy or attachment or 
execution—and a new law or system which would make possible the overthrowing of 
such ownership on admittedly artificial and technical grounds, the former must 
be upheld and applied."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But to the above considerations 
must be added the important circumstance that, as already stated before, upon 
the execution of the deed of sale in his favor by Sammy <span class="SpellE">Maron</span>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> took possession of 
the tend conveyed as owner thereof, and introduced considerable improvements 
therein. To deprive him now of the same by sheer force of technicality would be 
against both justice and equity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view of all the foregoing, the 
decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
