				<H3>ANGEL BAUTISTA, PETITIONER, VS. MATILDE LIM
FOR AND IN BEHALF OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF PEDRO LIM, AND HON. MOISES F. DALISAY,
PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LANAO DEL NORTE, BRANCH V, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On June 19, 1974 Matilde Sales Lim, as administratrix of the
estate of her late husband, Pedro Lim, filed a complaint against Angel Bautista
in the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte, Iligan City Branch IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that complaint, she prayed for the
rescission of the contract executed on <st1:date year="1972" day="28" month="9">September
 28, 1972</st1:date> between Bautista and Pedro Lim whereby Bautista undertook
to develop into a subdivision certain parcels of <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Pedro Lim</st1:placename></st1:place> located in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iligan</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">She also prayed that the deed of sale with assumption of mortgage
executed on February 6, 1973 between Bautista, as vendee, and the Lim spouses,
as vendors, be declared void (Civil Case No. 246 or IV-271 and later
V-144).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she asked for the
reconveyance of a parcel of land with an area of twenty hectares which was
fictitiously sold to Bautista but which, with abuse of trust, he caused to be
registered in his name.</p>

<p class="BODY">As docketing fee for that complaint, she paid thirty-two pesos
(P32) only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the docket fee in
case the value of the property in litigation is more than P600 but less than
P3, 000 or when the case does not concern property but is one for natu­ralization,
adoption, legal separation, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Sec.
5(3) and (11), Rule 141, Rules of Court].</p>

<p class="BODY">Because Matilde Lim had alleged in paragraph 14 of her complaint
that the value of the twenty-hectare lot (one of the several lots involved in
the case) was five million pesos, Judge Eduardo C. Tutaan ordered her to pay
within a week from notice the sum of P9, 818 as deficiency docket fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since she could not pay the deficiency docket fee, it was
constituted (upon Judge Tutaan's order) as a first lien of the Government on the
properties in litigation covered by Original Certificates of Title Nos. <span class="GramE">RP- 21, RP-8 and Transfer Certifi­cate of Title No.</span> <span class="GramE">T-10937 (a.f.).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
third title covers the twenty hectare lot registered in Bautista's name.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Bautista discovered that the deficiency docket fee had
become a lien on that litigated twenty-hectare lot, he filed a motion praying
that the complaint of Matilde Lim against him be dismissed for nonpayment of
the docket fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Moises F. Dalisay in his order of <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1975</st1:date> modified Judge Tutaan's order by
treating the case as one for rescission or annulment of contract, or a case
whose value "cannot be estimated", and for which the filing fee is
two hundred pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He directed that
Matilde Lim should pay P168 as the balance of the docket fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She paid that deficiency on <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1975</st1:date>,
Bautista filed in this Court a petition for mandamus, certiorari and
prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed for the annulment
of Judge Tutaan's order constituting the de­ficiency docket fee of P9, 818 as a
lien on the lots involved in Civil Case No. 246 and of Judge Dalisay's order
allowing Matilde Lim to pay P168 only as deficiency docket fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bautista's theory is that because Matilde Lim did not pay the
deficiency docket fee of P9, 818, the lower court did not acquire jurisdiction
over Civil Case No. 246, and, there­fore, the case should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After this incident was submitted for decision, or on <st1:date year="1979" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1979</st1:date>, the parties submitted
to this Court a compromise agreement of the <u>main case</u> pending in the
lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked that the
compromise be approved as the basis of a judgment, not in this case but in the
main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No mention was made in the
compromise of what disposition should be made of this incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The compromise reads:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">"COMPROMISE AGREEMENT</p>

<blockquote>"COMES now parties, represented by their respective counsels,
unto this Honorable Court, most respectfully submit the following Compromise
Agreement, to wit:</blockquote>

following terms and conditions:</blockquote>

covered by TCT No. 10937 (a.f.) of the Register of Deeds of Iligan City, in the
name of Angel L. Bautista situated at Tomi­nobo, Iligan City, containing an
area of 20 hectares, more or less.</p>

<blockquote>"*plaintiff refers to respondent Matilde Lim</blockquote>

<blockquote>"**defendant refers to petitioner Angel Bautista"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issues are whether the docket fee for Civil Case No. 246, now
V-144 (IV-271<span class="GramE">),</span> should be regarded as fully paid and
whether the compromise may be approved by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that Judge Dalisay did not err in considering Civil Case
No. V-144 as basically one for rescission or annul­ment of contract which is
not susceptible of pecuniary estima­tion (1 Moran's Comments on the Rules of
Court, 1970 Ed. p. 55; Lapitan vs. Scandia, Inc., L-24668, July 31, 1968, 24
SCRA 479, 481-483).</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the fee for docketing it is P200, an amount already
paid by plaintiff, now respondent Matilde Lim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(She should pay also the two pesos legal research fund fee, if she has
not paid it, as required in section 4 of Republic Act No. 3870, the charter of
the U. P. Law Center.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling that the date of the payment of the docket fee is the
real date of the filing of the case (Malimit vs. Degamo, 120 Phil. 1247) has no
application to this case because here an initial docket fee of P32 was
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same observation applies to
the ruling in Garcia vs. Vasquez, L-26808, <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1969</st1:date>, 27 SCRA 505, where no docket fee was paid
when the petition for the probate of a will was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bautista's contention that the docket fee should be
based on P5,000,000, the alleged <u>market value</u> of the twenty-hectare land
already mentioned, is manifestly contrary to the provision of section 5, Rule
141 that "if the case concerns real estate, the <u>assessed value</u>
thereof shall be considered in computing the fees".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assessed value of the lands involved in
Civil Case No. V-144 appears to be P24, 000, more or less (pp. 68 and 79,
Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is some truth in respondents' contention that
Bautista's raising of the issue as to the deficiency in the payment of the
docket fee is a dilatory tactic because he raised it only after the pre-trial
was finished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
submission of the compromise agreement to this Court is an implied abandonment
on Bautista's part of his petition herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second issue, it is evident that the lower court, and
not this Court, should be the one to approve or pass upon the compromise <span class="GramE">agreement</span> which is a settlement of the main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The merits of the main case are not
involved in the instant incident regarding the docket fee.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court's orders of July
8 and <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1975</st1:date>
fixing the docket fee at P200 are affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The restraining order is dissolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties are directed to submit their compromise agreement to
the lower court for approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioner.</span></p>
