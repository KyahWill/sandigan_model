				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, by petitioner Procter &amp; Gamble Philippine Manufacturing
Cor<span style="">p</span>oration, from a decision of
the <span style="">Court </span>of Tax Appeals,
affirming that of respondent Commissioner of Customs, which denied petitioner's
claim for refund P1,434.00, paid as <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues on
three (3) shipments of palm oil and coconut fatty alcohol <span style="">unloaded at its </span>private wharf.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two issues are raised in this <span style="">appeal, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(1)
whether <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are collectible, under sections
2801 and 2802 of Republic Act No. 1937, on goods unloaded at private wharves;
and (2) if the first issue is decided in the affirmative, whether said <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are covered b the tax exemption provided in
Republic Act No. 901.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first issue has

the payment of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues imposed in Section 2802
of the Tariff and Customs Code on the two shipments of <span style="">caustic </span>soda which were not unloaded <span style="">on a </span>Government wharf.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code has for its

Philippines, exported through ports of entry of the Philippines, or shipped <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to the United States or any of its</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">possessions,

nationality of the exporting vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the case of logs, or <span class="SpellE">flitches</span> twelve inches square or

<blockquote>Section 14 imposed <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues only on export and were held to be payable although the subject
merchandise were loaded from a private wharf <span style="">1909 our legislators knew that there was no Government wharf existing
and it was found safe to assume that the Government intended </span>to collect <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fees, even without the use of Government owned
wharves, in order to raise funds for the acquisition and construc­tion of
wharves throughout the islands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1955 Congress enacted Republic Act 1371, imposing in
Section 3 thereof <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues on imports and

<blockquote>Interpreting Section 3, this Court stated
in Com­missioner of Customs vs. Superior Gas &amp; Equipment Co. that the
intention of Congress was not to levy <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fee On
merchandise unloaded at places other than Government wharves or without making
use of pier facilities and the proviso exempting from the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
fee all such imported merchandise makes this intention all the more evi­dent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Later, however, in 1957 Congress passed Re­public Act 1937,
Otherwise known as the Tariff and Customs Code which in Section 2802 thereof
provides for the payment of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues on imports
and exports. Section 2802 states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'SEC. 2802.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Schedule of

<blockquote>Section 2802 <span style="">is </span>an almost verbatim copy of Section 3 of Republic Act 1371
minus the proviso –</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> That:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>such <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fee
shall not be levied on articles imported or brought into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which are unloaded on private wharves.'</p>

<blockquote>"Procter &amp; Gamble maintains that the interpre­tation of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues in Commissioner of Customs v. Superior Gas
&amp; Equipment Co., supra, that <span class="SpellE">wharf­age</span> dues are
compensation, on rental for the use of a wharf, and no <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues shall be collected where no Government wharf is used, shall be applied in
this case because Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code, the law
applicable herein, was derived from Section 3 of Republic <span class="SpellE">Aet</span>
1371.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, it adds,
Section 2801 of the Tariff and Cus­toms Code adopted the definition of '<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues' provided for in Section 1(b) of Republic Act
1371.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the Commissioner of Cus­toms and the Court
of Tax Appeals are of the opinion that Section 2802 should be given an
interpretation different from that enunciated in Commissioner of Customs v.
Superior Gas 6 Equipment Co., supra, on Section 3 of Republic Act 1371 for the
reason that Section 2802, unlike Section 3, does not provide for an exemption
from <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues on goods unloaded on private
wharves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counter to this argu­ment,
Procter &amp; Gamble contends that the <span class="SpellE">afore<span style="">stated</span></span><span style=""> exemption clause is merely a <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span> and
therefore its presence in or absence from the law will not alter the meaning of
'<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>It <span style="">moreover avers that
the Tariff and Customs Code, a codification of existing tariff and customs
laws, is presumed to have incorporated pertinent laws without change and any
modification introduced therein was merely to simplify the language of the law
but not to change its meaning.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It should be noted that the Tariff and Customs Code levies
charges on the different activi­ties of a vessel engaged in foreign trade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For coming to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from a foreign port or for going to a foreign port from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
one pays tonnage dues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For entrance into
or de­parture from a port of entry, harbor fees are collected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Wharfage</span></u></span><u><span style=""> </span>dues
are assessed against the c</u><u><span style="">argo</span></u>
discharged by vessel engage in foreign trade.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Berthing charges are levied on a vessel coming or mooring within
specified places or <span style="">water, </span>of a
port.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"A vessel </span>ordinarily
enters a harbor and <span style="">la </span>anchor or
moors in a port to load, to unload or both.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In doing so, the vessel derives benefit from port facilities provided
and maintained by Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, they are in fairness made to contribute a share in said Government undertaking
by payment of berthing charges and harbor fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, cargoes discharged to a Philippine port from a vessel engaged
in foreign trade <span style="">derive </span>benefit
from port facilities provided and maintained by the Government; said cargoes
should also share the cost of providing and keeping a safe port, in the form of
<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly a vessel that anchors at Manila Bay to seek protection from
a storm is not charged <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues the Bureau of
Customs, although it may have to harbor fees and berthing charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when a <span style="">ves</span>sel anchors at the Bay and
discharges or unloads its cargo, <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are
forthwith collected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as stated,
said dues are assessed against the cargo discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from the provision of the law
under which the assessment is based on the quantity, weight or measure of the
cargo received by the importer and/or discharged by such vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues
on the cargo are dis­tinct from harbor fees or berthing charges on the vessel,
so much so that different sections of the law cover them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since in the present case, the <span style="">vessels </span>in­volved called on port to unload, as they in fact <span style="">did, some cargo, said cargo, having been
unloaded amidst the safety afforded by the port, is charge able with <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, <span class="SpellE">Wharfage</span> dues partake of the nature
of a tax which is collected by the Government to support its operation in
relation to customs affairs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner herein has not adduced any reason, and we find none,
to warrant a reversal or modification of the foregoing view, which is hereby
reiterated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the second
issue, section 1 of Republic Act No 901 reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Any person, partnership, company or corporation who or which,
subsequent to the approval of this Act (June 20, 1953), shall engage in a new
and neces<span style="">sary industry shall be
entitled to exemp­tion until December thirty-one, nineteen </span>hundred and
fifty eight from payment of <span style="">all taxes
directly payable by such person, partnership, company or corporation in </span>respect
to said industry <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY">The issue hinges<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
on whether or not the phrase "all taxes," as used in the above
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>embraces "<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues." Petitioner maintains that it does,
upon the theory that, according to American decisions, the word "tax"
when used alone includes customs levies or import entries, and that "customs"
are "taxes levied upon goods or merchandise imported or exported" or
"the duties, toll, tribute or tariff payable upon merchandise imported or
exported."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

distinguishes between <span style="">taxes, on the one
hand, and "imposts" - that is to say, tariff rates or duties im­posed

</span>Similarly, the Constitution does not consider "<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues" as part of "tariff rates" or customs duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And neither does our

Title I, of said Code, under the headings "tariff Law" and
"Import Tariff," re­spectively, whereas <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues are collectible pursuant to Book II thereof, Title VII of said book, under
the cap­tion "Fees and Charges Collectible by the Bureau of Cus­toms."
Indeed, said Code regards customs duties, taxes and <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
charges as three (3) distinct and separate concepts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, Section 1604 thereof provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shall be disregarded, and a fraction of a peso amounting to fifty centavos or
more shall be considered as one peso.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are charged, not for the use of any
