				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by defendants, <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and Antonio Gallardo, from a decision of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, convicting them of
the crime of rape and sentencing each to life imprisonment, to jointly and
severally indemnify the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanigue</span>, in the sum of P3,000.00, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that, on <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1968</st1:date>, appellants herein had carnal knowledge
of <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanigue</span> in a
dark place, near a <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> swamp, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Domalandan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only issue in this appeal is whether or
not the act took place against the will of <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>,
as testified to by her, or with her consent, as appellants would have Us
believe.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanigue</span>,
the complaining witness, was, on the date above mentioned, 14 years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and her two younger sisters lived
separately from their mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
death of <span class="SpellE">Farmacita's</span> father, about 8 years ago, she
and her sisters had stayed with their grandmother, Maria Manuel, about 1
kilometer away from the scene of the occurrence, in order to go to which it was
necessary to take a <span class="SpellE">banca</span> and cross a river.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> testified that, while she and
her cousins, <span class="SpellE">Marvini</span> and Emma <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>,
were viewing a singing contest in said barrio of <span class="SpellE">Domalandan</span>,
on February 17, 1968, at about midnight, her schoolmate, appel­lant <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, approached her
and said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"come, your mother is
sending for you." At first she took this as a joke, but, when he repeated
the statement, she decided to heed <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span>, who was
then with his co-­defendant, Antonio Gallardo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As <span class="SpellE">Marvini</span> and Emma <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>
refused to accompany her, for they were enjoying the show, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
headed, together with <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and Antonio Gallardo, towards the river­bank, where, she understood, her mother
was in a <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, waiting for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching, however, a dark place, beside
a <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> swamp, near the river, about 50 meters away
from the crowd watching the singing contest, <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span>
snatched her handkerchief and inserted it into her mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about the same time, Antonio Gallardo held
her two hands and forced her to lie down, whereupon <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span>
placed him­self on top of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> resisted, <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> tore
her panties and had carnal knowledge of her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, he exchanged places with Antonio Gallardo, and took hold of <span class="SpellE">Farmacita's</span> hands, as Antonio Gallardo abused her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span>
ravished her a second time, and so did Antonio Gallardo, in the order given.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> and Antonio departed,
immediately thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> remained there for
a while, too tired and weak to leave the place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she regained enough strength, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
went to the house of her aunt, Evangelista Rosario <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>,
for lack of a <span class="SpellE">banca</span> to cross the river, in order to
go to her grandmother's house, to which she went later the next morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the while, she was crying, but she would
not disclose the reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, despite questions
propounded by her relatives, until the evening of <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1968</st1:date>, when her uncle, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
Rosario, managed to make her talk and she revealed the outrage committed upon
her by appellants herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter
was, accordingly, reported to the authorities the next day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> testified that <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
had been his sweetheart since August 1967, although he did not intend to marry
her; that, prior to the date of the occurrence, they had performed the sexual
act in a <span class="SpellE">moviehouse</span>; that, after embracing each other
and trying, in vain, to fornicate in a standing position, in the evening of
February 17, 1968, he bade her to lie down on her back and then placed himself
on top of her; that, at this juncture, Antonio Gallardo arrived, in view of
which he (<span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span>) stood up; and that Antonio
Gallardo then kissed <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>, fondled her breasts
and had carnal knowledge of her, in his presence, with her consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gallardo further stated that, while he was
satisfying his lust, one Gil <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> came, whereupon
he (Antonio) stood up and Gil copulated with her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio Gallardo's aunt, <span class="SpellE">Primitiva</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, testified that she followed <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanigue</span> as they left the crowd gathered in the singing
contest and then watched the couple, for about 10 minutes, as they embraced
each other in a standing position, and, thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
lay down on the ground and <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> placed himself on
top of her.</p>

<p class="BODY">As witnesses for the defense, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
Trinidad and Jesus Valencia would, also, have the Court believe that in the
afternoon of February 18, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> went to the
store of the former, who asked her "what did you do last night?";
and, that, in reply thereto, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> bade her to
"keep quiet" because her mother was nearby.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' counsel maintains that His Honor, the trial Judge,
has erred in believing the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanigue</span> - who was partly corroborated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, a resident
physician of the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> General Hospital, who
examined her therein, on February 21, 1968, and by Maria Manuel and <span class="SpellE">Marvini</span> <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>, grandmother
and cousin, respectively, of <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> - and in
finding the version of the defense unworthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record, however, refutes appellants'
pretense.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, their version is inherently incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, no woman would have consented to have
sexual intercourse with two men - or three, according to Antonio Gallardo - in
the presence of each other, unless she were a prostitute or as morally debased
as one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the record before Us
contains no indication that <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>, a 14-year old,
first-year high school student, can be so characterized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, her testimony in court
evinced the simplicity and candor peculiar to her youth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, appellants could not even suggest
any reason why <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> would falsely impute to them
the commission of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the theory of the prosecution has been fully borne out
by the conduct of the parties subsequently to the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for instance, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
was left alone at the scene thereof, immediately after appellants had satisfied
their lust, thereby indicating their guilty conscience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, had she cooperated with them,
appellants would have kept her company, at least for a while, even if only to
show their appreciation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, Maria
Manuel and <span class="SpellE">Marvini</span> <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>
confirmed the fact that <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> had been crying
incessantly, since the evening of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, she would not have reacted in this
manner had she willingly yielded to appellants' wishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, the prosecution has proven, and it
has not been denied, that an offer had been made by appellants' mothers and
reiterated four (4) times - once, in appellants' presence, in the courthouse -
for either of them to marry <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such offer - which <span style="">was </span>rejected - constitutes an implied
admission of guilt.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not believe that the presence of a crowd, about 50 meters
away from the place where <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> was ravished,
renders the theory of the prosecution incredible, inasmuch as the people were
then en­grossed watching a singing contest, and the scene of the occurrence was
dark and beyond their view, there being <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> swamps
nearby, apart from the fact that, being almost a child, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
was forthwith prevented from screaming, owing to the handkerchief that <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> had managed to stuff into her mouth, and easily
overpowered by him and Antonio Gallardo, who were 19 and 21 years of age,
respectively, and, hence, at the peak of their vigor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Primitiva</span> de
la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Trini­dad and Jesus Valencia bear
all the earmarks of artificiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
for instance, <span class="SpellE">Primitiva</span> declared that she followed <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> when they
left the group watching the singing contest, be­cause she suspected that the
couple would do something foolish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she found it difficult to explain why she did nothing to prevent them from
misbehaving, she said that her only interest in the matter was her nephew,
appellant Antonio Gallardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he
was <u>not</u> - she said - with said couple when the latter went to the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> swamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
joined them - pursuant to her and <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> - when <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> was already on top of <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, <span class="SpellE">Primitiva</span>
assured the Court, this was the time she left the place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the gist of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
Trinidad and Jesus Valencia is that, the day following that of the occurrence, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What did you do last night?", and
that, in reply, <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span> bade her to "keep
quiet" because her mother was nearby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> admitted, however, that, at that
time, she did <u>not</u> know, or had any inkling, that <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
had performed any act in particular, or that anything had happened to her, the
night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there was
no reason whatsoever to ask the aforemen­tioned question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record, We are satisfied that the lower
court did not err in finding that appellants' guilt has been established beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing that appellants had acted in conspiracy with each
other and cooperated with one another in abusing <span class="SpellE">Farmacita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tanigue</span>, each is guilty, as principal, not only of
the rape committed by him, but, also, of that committed by his co-defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Although each one had twice ravished the complainant, We cannot convict
appellants herein of four (4) rapes, for lack of the necessary allegations in
the information, under which each should be, and is hereby, held guilty as
principal, of one rape, by direct participation, and another rape, <span style="">by cooperation and direct participation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.
A. No. 4111, approved on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1964</st1:date>,
the penalty for the crime of rape, when committed by two or more persons, shall
be life imprisonment to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, appellants <span class="SpellE">Bermillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and Antonio Gallardo should each be sentenced twice, there­fore, to the minimum
of said penalty, or life imprisonment, for, al­though the offense was committed
at nighttime, it does not appear that the same was sought purposely, or taken
advantage of, or that it facilitated the commission of the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>So modified as to the penalty</b>, the decision appealed from
is, accordingly, affirmed, in all other respects, with costs against the
appellants.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
