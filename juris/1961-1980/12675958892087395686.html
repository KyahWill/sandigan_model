<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anunciacion</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> P. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Ouano</span>, widow of Damian M. <span class="SpellE">Ouano</span>, 
was the duly appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the Intestate 
Estate of her husband by the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>. (Sp. proc. 
No. 2143-R) On July 31, 1961, she presented a Petition for authority to sell her 
one fourth (1/4) <i>pro <span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></i> share in four 
parcels of land, described therein on August 18, 1961, the Court granted the 
petition and she was "authorized to execute the necessary deed of sale covering 
one-half undivided share belonging to this estate in the properties described in 
the petition for the sum of P155<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in favor of 
Atty. Antonio M. Cui." Cui was required to deposit the amount. Under date of 
August 28, 1961, the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> filed a motion 
praying that the offer of Cui be rejected, it appearing that in making the 
deposit of P155,000.00, Cui claimed that said amount was in payment of the four 
(4) parcels, and not just for the one-half (1/2), as ordered by the Court. An 
opposition to the motion was interposed by Cui. On September 8, 1961 the lower 
Court sustained the stand of Cui, stating that the bid offered by him (Cui) was 
understood to be for the four parcels of land. In another Order, of the same 
date, the court also denied the motion of the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> and required her, together with the co-owner 
of the property, <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Martinez, who appeared 
before the Court, to execute the necessary deed of sale for the four (4) parcels 
of land for P155,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Claiming that the P155,000.00 
offer of Cui was accepted by the lower court, without benefit of public bidding, 
and that there is in fact an offer by the <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>, 
Richards &amp; Co., to purchase the same property for P270,000.00, the 
petitioners herein, Mario B. <span class="SpellE">Ouano</span> and Leticia O. 
<span class="SpellE">Arnaiz</span>, as heirs of Damian <span class="SpellE">Ouano</span>, "presented with the trial court an "Urgent Motion for 
Reconsideration and/ or Motion to Set Aside Court's Orders dated August 18 and 
September 8, 1961." <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Movants</span></span><span class="GramE"> therein (now petitioners) 
were allowed to adduce evidence in support of their Urgent Motion, both oral and 
documentary.</span> The lower court denied the motion for reconsideration, in an 
order dated April 3, 1962. On April 11, 1962, petitioners filed a Notice of 
Appeal against the orders dated August 18, September 8, 1961, and April 3, 1962. 
The Appeal Bond and Record on Appeal were also presented, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period. In an Order of May 3, 1962, the lower 
court rejected the appeal, on the ground that petitioners "have <span class="GramE">no</span> legal standing to meddle and interfere with the 
administration" of the state, there being a duly appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> "who is the only party legally clothed with 
authority to represent it" and also for the reason that the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, having already appealed the orders directing 
the sale of the property to Antonio Ma. Cui, the appeal of petitioners 
involving: the same subject-<span class="GramE">matter,</span> would clearly be a 
superfluity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners, claiming that the 
reasons advanced by the lower court in rejecting their appeal, were not valid, 
brought the matter to the Court of Appeals on a petition for "Mandamus", praying 
that the lower court be compelled to give duo course to said appeal. After 
proper proceedings, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment, dismissing the 
petition, sustaining the lower court in its ruling that petitioners herein have 
no legal standing in the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this appeal in this Court, however, counsel for 
the petitioners, on May 12, 1964, submitted a "Motion" praying for the dismissal 
of the petition. Attached to said petition is an Order of the respondent Judge, 
dated March 25, 1964, the contents of which read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In her motion, dated March 19, 
1964, the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> that she be allowed to 
withdraw the petition for authority to soil, dated July 24, 1961, the previous 
resolutions of which by this Court, having been reversed on appeal by the Court 
of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In view whereof, the Court 
hereby declares the aforesaid petition for authority to sell filed by the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> 
withdrawn."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering that the present case 
is an incident to the Petition filed by the said <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, on July 24, 1961, for authority to sell the 
interest of the estate over the 4 parcels of land, heretofore mentioned, with 
the withdrawal of Paid petition for authority to sell, the issues herein 
involved have become moot and academic. Appeal is dismissed, without 
pronouncement to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Benzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Reyes,
