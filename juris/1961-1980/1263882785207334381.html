				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission affirming the dismissal letter of the Chief, Workmen's Compensation
Commission Unit, Regional Office No. III, Department of Labor, of the claim for
death benefits filed by the petitioner in RO3-WCC Case No. 10532.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>, the deceased husband of
the petitioner, during his lifetime was employed as Section Chief in the
Provincial Auditor's Office, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
with an average weekly salary of P110.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the time of his employment, he contracted an illness which was
diagnosed by his attending physician as myocardial infarction for which he was
treated at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he succumbed to said illness on <st1:date year="1971" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 23, 1974 or about two years thereafter, petitioner filed
a claim for death benefits (WCC Form No. 4) with Regional Office No. III of the
Department of Labor at <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, attaching therewith, the Physician's Report
of Sickness or Accident and her affidavit of dependency (WCC Form No. 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1974</st1:date>,
the respondent Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Provincial Auditor's Office, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span></st1:placename></st1:place>)
thru the office of the Solicitor General, was required by the Regional Office
of the Department of Labor to accomplish and submit within ten (10) days the
Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, this requirement was not complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, no schedule of hearing was
set for the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1975</st1:date>,
the Chief, Workmen's Compensation Unit, RO3, issued a letter stating that the
claim of petitioner is being dropped from the calendar of activities of said
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1975</st1:date>, petitioner filed a motion for
reconsideration of the letter of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of said motion, the entire record of the case was elevated to
the Workmen's Compensation Commission for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1976</st1:date>,
the Workmen's Compensation Commission rendered its decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the dropping of the instant case from the calendar
of the Regional Office should be, as it is hereby AFFIRMED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim is dismissed for lack of
merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner now assails said decision contending that:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief, Workmen's Compensation Unit,
Regional Office No. III, in his letter dismissal dated November 11, 1975 and
the Workmen's Compensation Commission in its decision dated January 14, 1976,
which affirmed the letter dismissal, seriously erred and committed grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when they decided the case
without hearing and notice, hence, depriving herein petitioner her
constitutional right to due process of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief, Workmen's Compensation Unit,
Regional Office No. III and the Commission seriously erred and committed grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in dismissing
petitioner's claim being contrary to law and evidence on record.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the claim of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the dismissal of petitioner's
claim by the Regional Office of the Workmen's Compensation Commission on the
ground that it was filed after the lapse of two years from the death of her
husband is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true
that under Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act a claim for
compensation shall be made not later than three months after death,
nevertheless, a delay in the filing of the claim is considered as a
non-jurisdictional defect unless it is shown that the employer has been
prejudiced thereby.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of Operators vs. <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court speaking through Justice Fernando, said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is much too late in the day to complain about the long
delay in instituting the claim here of seven years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This court in 1965 categorically declared
that failure to file a claim within the statutory period does not affect the
jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation Commission (Manila Railroad Co. vs.
Perez, L-21071, June 29, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
doctrine found mention in a 1968 decision, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
Sugar Mills vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span>
(22 SCRA 325), citing two cases decided the year before (Nat. Dev. Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span>, 20 SCRA 192 and Nat. Dev. Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Rongavilla</span>, 20 SCRA 1172). In the first, it took the
claimant eight years and in the second, nine years before the right to compensation
was sought to be enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
non-jurisdictional character was stressed anew in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Co., Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, announced less than
two months later (22 SCRA 1215).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
same effect are later cases likewise of 1968 vintage (<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
Consolidated Milling Co. vs. WCC, 23 SCRA 820; Manila Railroad Co. vs. Rivera,
23 SCRA 922; San Miguel Brewery vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Joves</span>, 23 SCRA 1093).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have had occasion this year to rule similarly (<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Dadivas</span>, 27 SCRA 413)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The ruling in the case of Pioneer
Ceramics vs. <span class="SpellE">Samia</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
likewise, bears the same effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
there is nothing in the record to show the contrary, We see no possible
prejudice that could have been suffered by the respondent Republic due to the
late filing of petitioner's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
circumstances do not warrant its dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the Workmen's Compensation Commission went
further by stating that the dismissal of petitioner's claim should be affirmed
as the only evidence submitted by the latter is the attending physician's
report which is not verified and therefore, not a convincing proof that the
sickness which caused the deceased's death is service connected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 1, Rule 12 of the Rules of the Commission in relation to
Section 49 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, "reports of attending and/or
examining physicians and hospital records in relation to the case", among
others, constitute admissible evidence provided the other party shall be given
the opportunity to examine and rebut the same by further evidence (Sec. 2, Rule
12, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, notwithstanding
the failure to submit them formally as such, they may still be considered as
evidence provided that they were previously submitted with the claim and
already part of the record.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the non-verification of the physician's report is not such a fatal
defect as would totally make the same devoid of evidentiary value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, no evidence was ever
presented by the respondent Republic rebutting the physician's report submitted
by the petitioner with the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
physician's report shows that the deceased, Jose <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>,
died of myocardial infarction and at the time of his death, he was still in the
service of the respondent Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only issue then that remains to be resolved is whether or not the illness that
caused the death of petitioner is service connected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well settled is the rule that once the
illness has supervened in the course of employment, there exists a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that the same arose out of or was at least aggravated by such employment and
the burden to overthrow said presumption shifts to the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It is undisputed that Jose <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> died of an illness
that supervened during the time of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption therefore, of causation or
aggravation prevails in the premises considering that herein respondent
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as employer, failed to discharge the burden of overthrowing the same by not
presenting any evidence to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the Workmen's Compensation Act being a social legislation
should be liberally construed in favor of and for the benefit of employees and
their dependents and all doubts as to the right of compensation resolved and
all presumptions indulged in their favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>
