				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are &nbsp;twenty-four of 89 &nbsp;cases decided &nbsp;by the &nbsp;Court of Appeals in a single consolidated decision, promulgated on &nbsp;July 27, &nbsp;1961, the dispositive &nbsp;part &nbsp;of which provides as follows: <blockquote> <p>"Upon the &nbsp;foregoing considerations, the &nbsp;writs of certiorari &nbsp;and prohibition are granted &nbsp;in the &nbsp;cases of the petitioners who are buyers of lots &nbsp; within the &nbsp;Tatalon Estate, &nbsp;whose &nbsp;names are included in the list of buyers in annex B &nbsp;of the compromise &nbsp;agreement, and who made known their intention to buy the lots occupied by them, and &nbsp;have filed the appropriate &nbsp;actions &nbsp;in court, &nbsp;for, as &nbsp;already stated hereinabove, said petitioners, as defendants in the ejectment suits, can not &nbsp;be &nbsp;ejected &nbsp;from the premises occupied by them, notwithstanding the final decisions in the ejectment suits filed &nbsp;against them, until after &nbsp;their rights to the land have been finally determined in the pending actions. &nbsp;As &nbsp;to the &nbsp;petitioners who &nbsp;do not come within the scope &nbsp;of the foregoing ruling, &nbsp;their petitions are dismissed. On equitable considerations no pronouncement as &nbsp;to costs is hereby made." </p> </blockquote> <p> and against which &nbsp;petitioner J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., interposed a petition for certiorari on the ground of grave errors of law.</p> <p>The cases were initiated by &nbsp;petition &nbsp;for certiorari and prohibition, filed &nbsp;by the occupants of lots in the Tatalon Estate in the Court of Appeals, seeking to prohibit Judge Hermogenes Caluag of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court &nbsp;of &nbsp;First Instance &nbsp;of Quezon City &nbsp;from &nbsp;enforcing execution of &nbsp;his final and executory &nbsp;decisions and &nbsp;orders of &nbsp;execution &nbsp;previously rendered against them in the numerous litigations involving possession &nbsp;of lots in &nbsp;the Tatalon &nbsp;Estate &nbsp;in &nbsp;Quezon City. &nbsp;The Court of Appeals &nbsp;in its decisions, declared that these &nbsp; individual &nbsp;respondents &nbsp;(petitioners below)— </p> <blockquote> <p>"were defendants in separate &nbsp;complaints &nbsp;filed by J. M. Tuason &nbsp;&amp; Co., Inc., &nbsp;in the &nbsp; Court of &nbsp;First Instance of Rizal, &nbsp;Quezon City branch. &nbsp;The nature of the actions &nbsp;was to &nbsp;recover &nbsp;possession of portions of a parcel of land included in a bigger tract of SO "quiñones", covered by transfer certificate of &nbsp;title &nbsp;No. &nbsp;1267 &nbsp; (37686-Rizal), in &nbsp;the name of J. M. Tuazon &amp; Co., Inc., and occupied by the defendants. &nbsp;Service of summons &nbsp;and complaint &nbsp;upon &nbsp;each defendant was &nbsp;fully &nbsp; made by &nbsp;the &nbsp;process server. &nbsp;The regularity &nbsp;and validity of the service of process upon each defendant &nbsp;has &nbsp;not been assailed. &nbsp;&nbsp;The court, therefore, acquired jurisdiction over the person of the defendants.</p> <p>In respect of the proceedings &nbsp; had in &nbsp;connection with &nbsp;the trial of the above-entitled cases in the &nbsp;lower court, it &nbsp;appears that there were defendants who have filed answers to the complaint, and were present at &nbsp;the trial during which &nbsp;the parties adduced &nbsp;evidence. There were defendants &nbsp; who have also filed answers to the complaint, but failed to appear at the trial, &nbsp;and the plaintiff adduced evidence in their absence. &nbsp;And other &nbsp;defendants &nbsp;were declared &nbsp;in default, upon &nbsp;petition of the &nbsp;plaintiff, for &nbsp;failure to file &nbsp;answers &nbsp;to the complaint. &nbsp;&nbsp;In those cases, too, the plaintiff presented evidence. &nbsp;The petitioners come within either &nbsp;of &nbsp;the three categories of defendant. Separate decisions were rendered in each case, wherein the defendant was ordered &nbsp;to vacate &nbsp;the premises occupied by him, &nbsp;to &nbsp;remove his house erected on the land, and to pay to the plaintiff damages &nbsp;in concept of rental for the use and &nbsp;occupation of the &nbsp;property. &nbsp;Some of &nbsp;the defendants who were declared in &nbsp;default, or who &nbsp;failed &nbsp;to appear at the trial, presented &nbsp;motions to be relieved from the effect of the judgment or &nbsp;order. &nbsp;After due &nbsp;hearing the motions &nbsp;were denied. &nbsp;No appeal from the aforesaid &nbsp;orders &nbsp;was &nbsp;ever &nbsp;taken by the defendants concerned. &nbsp;The decisions rendered in the cases have become &nbsp;final and executory &nbsp;as &nbsp;no appeal &nbsp;has &nbsp; been interposed by the defendants from &nbsp;said decisions." &nbsp;(Italics supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p>The &nbsp;grounds relied upon by the &nbsp;petitioners below &nbsp;(now respondents) &nbsp;are &nbsp;common to all petitions, and are &nbsp;thus described &nbsp;in &nbsp;the decisions under review:</p> <blockquote>"All the &nbsp;above-named petitioners are represented in this &nbsp;Court by Attorney Cornelio S. Ruperto. &nbsp;The petitions have &nbsp;shown &nbsp;a set and &nbsp;unvarying pattern &nbsp;in the narration of the facts which, &nbsp;as already stated, are fundamentally identical in all the petitions. Typical of the allegations in the petitions &nbsp;are the following: &nbsp;(a) &nbsp;That Aniana Deudor was and &nbsp;is &nbsp;one of the original owners and contracting &nbsp; parties collectively &nbsp;designated as &nbsp;DEUDORS, as well as of the co-owners of &nbsp;the undivided parcel of land &nbsp;known &nbsp;as the TATALON' ESTATE, ; &nbsp;(b) That the defendants &nbsp;in the &nbsp;lower court, petitioners herein, are purchasers for value and in good faith of the portions of land occupied by them &nbsp;which they have already paid almost the full price &nbsp;of the land, &nbsp;and &nbsp;that they are &nbsp;in possession &nbsp;thereto; &nbsp;(c) &nbsp; That Tuason &amp; &nbsp;Co., has &nbsp;absolutely no &nbsp;right whatsoever &nbsp;to &nbsp;take any positive &nbsp;action nor to file and bring &nbsp;ejectment suits for recovery of possession against the herein petitioners, until and unless the &nbsp;said respondent &nbsp;has &nbsp;completely paid the sum of &nbsp;Pl,201,063.00 &nbsp;to &nbsp;the contracting &nbsp;parties &nbsp;collectively &nbsp;designated as DEUDORS as provided &nbsp;for under the &nbsp;COMPROMISE AGREEMENT &nbsp;dated &nbsp;March 16, &nbsp;1953, &nbsp;* *.';(d) &nbsp;That the actions &nbsp;for recovery of possession 'were &nbsp;filed and brought &nbsp;by J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., upon the strength of &nbsp;the order &nbsp;of &nbsp;the respondent Judge, dated March 31, &nbsp;1938 &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;granting said &nbsp;respondent corporation authority to file ejectment &nbsp;suits and forcible &nbsp;entry and &nbsp;detainer cases not &nbsp;only against the &nbsp;DEUDORS, &nbsp;but likewise against the lot holders &nbsp;and purchasers in good &nbsp;faith and &nbsp;for &nbsp;value &nbsp;from the DEUDORS', and that &nbsp;'the &nbsp;said authority to &nbsp;file &nbsp;ejectment &nbsp;suits is in direct violation &nbsp;of the provisions of the COMPROMISE AGREEMENT, * * obtained by the said respondent J. &nbsp;M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., through &nbsp;collusive &nbsp;schemes &nbsp;and &nbsp;processes &nbsp;and grave influence peddling with the trial &nbsp;court. &nbsp;* *. &nbsp;Petitioners' contention is &nbsp; founded &nbsp;on the decision, marked &nbsp;Annex E, and &nbsp;the &nbsp;orders respectively marked &nbsp;as Annexes &nbsp;E-l &nbsp;and E-2 of the trial court.';(e) &nbsp;That on October 31, 1960, an action was filed &nbsp;in &nbsp;the Court of First &nbsp;Instance of &nbsp;Rizal, &nbsp;Quezon City Branch, docketed as civil case No. Q-5492, in the name &nbsp;of the Republic &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Philippines, by the BARRIO TATALON &nbsp;GOVERNMENT; &nbsp;and (f) That on February 24, 1961, a complaint for the expropriation of the TATALON &nbsp;ESTATE &nbsp;in the name &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp; Republic of the &nbsp;Philippines, represented by the Land Tenure Administration, was filed &nbsp;in the Court of First &nbsp;Instance of&nbsp; Rizal, Quezon City branch."<p></p></blockquote> <p> Petitioners J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., (respondent below in &nbsp;all &nbsp;the cases) &nbsp;resisted the &nbsp;petition &nbsp;for prerogative writs, mainly because, as admitted by the Court of Appeals in its decision,</p> <blockquote> <p>"The &nbsp;petitions under consideration are bereft &nbsp;of any allegation that the petitioners are included in the list of buyers in Annex B of the compromise agreement" </p> </blockquote> <p> between &nbsp;Tuason &amp; &nbsp;Co., &nbsp;Inc., and the &nbsp;Deudors, &nbsp;in &nbsp;&nbsp;case Nos. &nbsp;Q-135, 139, &nbsp;174, 177, and 186. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;the Court of Appeals held that— </p> <blockquote> <p>"the lack of such allegation in the petitions is &nbsp;not a fatal defect nor substantial enough as &nbsp;to &nbsp;defeat &nbsp;a right which has been &nbsp;preserved or safeguarded for them."</p> </blockquote> <p>As a result, the Court of Appeals &nbsp;decreed, as &nbsp;stated in the beginning of this opinion, the &nbsp;suspension of the &nbsp;execution as to those petitioners whose &nbsp;names, as &nbsp;buyers of lots in the Tatalon Estate, &nbsp;appears &nbsp;in the lists (Annex B), attached &nbsp;to the compromise agreement between Tuason &amp; Co. and the Deudors, and &nbsp;who &nbsp;have filed appropriate action in courts to purchase the lots they occupy.</p> <p> Considering that &nbsp;it has been &nbsp;repeatedly ruled by &nbsp;this Court that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, &nbsp;injunction, &nbsp;and &nbsp;prohibition, <i>&nbsp;in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, only</i> in those cases where the parties have &nbsp;a &nbsp;right to appeal to that Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; it is &nbsp;clear that said court could &nbsp;not &nbsp;validly entertain the petitions filed in &nbsp;these cases unless the judgments &nbsp;and&nbsp; orders of execution complained of could have been appealed to the &nbsp;Court of Appeals. &nbsp;But this is not the case, because the judgments &nbsp;in ejectment against the individual respondents (petitioners below) were already final and executory, as expressly recognized in &nbsp;the &nbsp;consolidated judgment under review; and as to the orders and writs of execution of said final judgments, the same are, likewise, not appealable &nbsp;(Molina <i>vs.</i> De la Riva( &nbsp;8 Phil. 571), there being no allegation that the writs of execution have varied the tenor of &nbsp;the respective &nbsp;judgments (Castro <i>vs.</i> Surtida, 87 Phil., 166; &nbsp;47 Off. (Supp.) &nbsp;351, 354). &nbsp;Having no jurisdiction over the cases, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of Appeals' consolidated decision now &nbsp;before Us is without authority in law; hence, it is null and void.</p> <p>The lack of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals is also apparent from the fact that &nbsp;the petitioners below &nbsp;(now respondents) contended in their petition that the Court of First &nbsp;Instance <i>&nbsp; "had no &nbsp;power right &nbsp;or &nbsp;jurisdictio</i>n to enforce his controversial order dated February 28, 1957" (Petition in CA-G. R. &nbsp;No. 28632, par. XVI), and that the execution of the final judgments rendered by the Court of First Instance in the &nbsp;various ejectment &nbsp;cases &nbsp;should be suspended in view of the terms of the compromise between Tuason &amp; Co. &nbsp;and the Deudors, the pendency &nbsp;of actions to fix &nbsp;the price that should be paid by the persons whose rights as purchasers had been recognized by &nbsp;Tuasons &nbsp;&amp; Co &nbsp;and the Land Tenure &nbsp;Administration's endeavors to expropriate the land. &nbsp;Whether the Court of First Instance had <i>jurisdiction</i> to &nbsp;order that &nbsp;its &nbsp;ejectment decisions be executed, and whether the facts &nbsp;alleged &nbsp;were sufficient causes for suspending the execution of the judgments of ejectment, even if already final, and whether the Court of First Instance abused its discretion in refusing &nbsp;to suspend execution, are pure questions of law that lay within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals &nbsp;(Judiciary Act , sec. 17, Nos. 3 and &nbsp;6).</p> <p>It is well to note, in this connection, that this Supreme Court has previously ruled &nbsp;(at least twice) &nbsp;against interference &nbsp;by the Court &nbsp;of Appeals &nbsp;with the execution &nbsp;of final &nbsp;judgments &nbsp;under &nbsp;similar circumstances &nbsp;(Tuason &amp; Co. &nbsp;vs. Sanvictores, &nbsp;L-16836, January 30, &nbsp;1962, Tuason <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Court &nbsp;of Appeals &nbsp;&amp; Rosete, L-18128, &nbsp;December &nbsp;26, 1961).</p> <p>Turning now &nbsp;to the grounds urged for the &nbsp;suspension of writs of &nbsp;execution, &nbsp; we find that the respondent &nbsp;occupants of lots in &nbsp;the &nbsp;Tatalon Estate rely first on the compromise entered &nbsp;into in 1953 between the registered owner, Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., and the original claimants to the property, &nbsp;the Florencio Deudors, et al., in Case No. Q-135 of Quezon City, and approved &nbsp;by that court, wherein it &nbsp;was stipulated as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"SEVENTH.—That the &nbsp;sales of the possessory rights claimed by the DEUDORS, are &nbsp;described &nbsp;in the lists submitted by &nbsp;them to the OWNERS which are attached hereto marked Annexes 'B' and 'C &nbsp;and &nbsp;made &nbsp;part hereof. &nbsp;Whatever amounts &nbsp;may have &nbsp;been collected &nbsp;by the DEUDORS on account thereof, &nbsp;shall be deducted from &nbsp;the total sum of Pl,201,063.00 to be paid to them. &nbsp;It &nbsp;shall be the joint &nbsp;and &nbsp;solidary obligation &nbsp;of the &nbsp;DEUDORS to &nbsp;make the buyer &nbsp;of the &nbsp;lots purportedly sold by them &nbsp;to &nbsp;recognize the title of the &nbsp;OWNERS over the property purportedly bought by them, and to make them sign, whenever &nbsp;possible, &nbsp;new contracts of &nbsp;purchase &nbsp;for &nbsp;said property as the current &nbsp;prices and &nbsp;terms specified by the OWNERS in their sales of lots in their subdivision known &nbsp;as &nbsp;"Sta. &nbsp; Mesa &nbsp;&nbsp;Heights Subdivision." &nbsp;&nbsp;The DEUDORS HEREBY &nbsp;advise &nbsp;of the OWNERS that the buyer listed in Annex 'B' herein with the annotation &nbsp;'continue' &nbsp;shall &nbsp;buy the lots respectively occupied by them and shall &nbsp;sign contracts, but the sums already paid by them to the DEUDORS amounting to P134,922.84 (subject to verification by the Court) shall be credited to the buyers and shall be deducted from the sums to be paid &nbsp;to the DEUDORS by the OWNERS. The DEUDORS also advise the OWNERS that 'the buyers listed &nbsp;in Annex "C" herein with the annotation 'Refund' Dave decided not to continue with their former contracts or purchases with &nbsp;the &nbsp;DEUDORS and the &nbsp;sums already &nbsp;paid by them cto the DEUDORS TOTALLING &nbsp;P101,182.42 (subject to verification by the &nbsp;Court) &nbsp;shall &nbsp;be refunded to them by the OWNERS &nbsp;and deducted from the &nbsp;sums that may &nbsp;be due to the DEUDORS from the OWNERS;"</p> </blockquote> <p>They also invoke the case of Lucina Evangelista<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Deudor et al., &nbsp;106 Phil., 170; decided by this Court on September 10, 1959, wherein this Court stated the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>"It is clear that there &nbsp;now exists a &nbsp;sort of contractual relation between the &nbsp;plaintiff &nbsp;and Tuason &nbsp;&amp; Co. &nbsp;as regards the sale of Lot No. 126; and that as regards said lot, plaintiff is the &nbsp;purchaser &nbsp;and has made payments &nbsp;on &nbsp;account of the purchase price, and Tuason &amp; Co. acknowledges the partial payments already made, the same to &nbsp;be deducted &nbsp;from the &nbsp;sum payable to &nbsp;Deudor. That Deudor has an obligation and responsibility to the plaintiff there is no question; and the case &nbsp;is still pending against him, thereby giving &nbsp;the trial court an &nbsp;opportunity to determine the nature and extent &nbsp;of, said obligation &nbsp;and responsibility."</p> </blockquote> <p>However, there is a substantial difference &nbsp;between the situation of Lucina Evangelista, in the case cited, and the individual &nbsp;respondents herein, in that (as found by &nbsp;this Court in its decision &nbsp;&nbsp;in &nbsp;106 &nbsp;&nbsp;Phil., &nbsp;170!) Lucina Evangelista was an immediate vendee of Pedro Deudor, &nbsp;had made payments on account &nbsp;of her purchase of lot &nbsp;126, and, as a &nbsp;matter of fact, her name &nbsp;was included &nbsp;in the list of purchasers Annex B, &nbsp;appended to the compromise agreement between Tuason &amp; &nbsp;Co., and the Deudors, heretofore mentioned. &nbsp;Moreover, Evangelista had filed action to &nbsp;have her rights &nbsp;recognized by the parties to &nbsp;the &nbsp;compromise.</p> <p>On the other hand, it nowhere appears in the present case that respondent occupants had their &nbsp; names included in the Annex &nbsp;B to the compromise, &nbsp;or that they had made &nbsp;payments, &nbsp;or &nbsp;that &nbsp;they had &nbsp;filed suits &nbsp;to compel recognition of their alleged rights as buyers &nbsp;before the eviction &nbsp;judgments against them became final. &nbsp;The &nbsp; Court of Appeals expressly &nbsp;found as a fact &nbsp;that—</p> <blockquote> <p>"the &nbsp;petitions under consideration &nbsp;are bereft of any allegation that the petitioners are included &nbsp;in the list of buyers in &nbsp;Annex B of the compromise agreement", </p> </blockquote> <p> and that—</p> <blockquote> <p>"While copies of the aforesaid compromise agreement have been attached to the petition under consideration, the Annexes B and C of the compromise agreement are not included."</p> </blockquote> <p>As the case now &nbsp;stands, therefore, there is nothing on record &nbsp;to establish &nbsp;that the respondent occupants &nbsp;(who are the ones that sought suspension of their &nbsp;eviction by petition for certiorari &nbsp;and prohibition in the Court &nbsp;of Appeals against the Court of First Instance, &nbsp;the Sheriff, and the petitioners Tuason &amp; Co., Inc.,) were recognized by Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., to be purchasers from the &nbsp;Deudora, or that they &nbsp;filed &nbsp;in &nbsp;due time actions to &nbsp;enforce their supposed rights. &nbsp;Neither is there evidence, beyond mere allegations, &nbsp;that they were purchasers in good faith and for value, or had made payments on account of their purchases. &nbsp;It &nbsp;was no doubt due to absence of any such proof that the Court of Appeals was &nbsp;unable to pinpoint &nbsp;the individual parties whose &nbsp;eviction &nbsp;should be halted, and had to content itself with a hypothetical pronouncement in &nbsp;its decision ordering the suspension of the eviction of those—</p> <blockquote> <p>"whose &nbsp;names are included in the list annex B of the compromise, and who have made known their intention to &nbsp;buy the lots &nbsp;occupied by them, and have filed appropriate actions in court."</p> </blockquote> <p>The &nbsp;failure of respondents lot occupants to even allege, much less prove, that they are &nbsp;covered by the list Annex B of the Tuason-Deudor compromise is strongly indicative that they were not included therein; therefore, &nbsp;they are not entitled to have the ruling in Lucina Evangelista &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Deudor, &nbsp;ante, applied in &nbsp; their &nbsp;favor. &nbsp;Otherwise, they would &nbsp;not only have averred the fact in their &nbsp; petitions for certiorari, &nbsp;but &nbsp;they &nbsp;would have also invoked their pretended preferential claims to purchase the lots they occupy in &nbsp;the various &nbsp;evictions proceedings &nbsp;instituted &nbsp;against them., &nbsp;before &nbsp;the judgments therein had &nbsp;(as they admit tedly have) &nbsp;become &nbsp;final and &nbsp;executory.</p> <p>In &nbsp;Tuason &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. &nbsp;Sanvictores, &nbsp;L-16836, &nbsp;January 30, 1962, this Court said:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Assuming, &nbsp;without deciding, that the Tuasons had really hound themselves to &nbsp;recognize the alleged preferential rights of the vendees of &nbsp;Deudors, it is more than remarkable that &nbsp;appellee Sanvictores, one of the vendees, did &nbsp;not &nbsp;take steps to enforce his supposed &nbsp;preference until after the adverse &nbsp;decision &nbsp;of the Court of First &nbsp;Instanc3 in the possession &nbsp;action had become final and executory in 1959. six &nbsp;years after the Deudor-Tuason compromise was made. &nbsp;This inaction of Sanvictores is all the more strange when We consider that &nbsp;he could have set up &nbsp;such preferential &nbsp; rights as a defense &nbsp;against the &nbsp;suit filed &nbsp;by appellant &nbsp;Tuason &nbsp;&amp; Company against &nbsp;him. If he really was entitled to &nbsp;purchase the contested lot, the claim was &nbsp;in &nbsp;the nature &nbsp;of a compulsory &nbsp;counterclaim under Section 6 of &nbsp;Rule 10, since it was necessarily connected with the right of possession asserted by the Tuasons, and did not require the presence &nbsp;of third &nbsp;parties &nbsp;for its &nbsp; adjudication. &nbsp;Both under Section 6 of Rule 10, as well as Section &nbsp;10 &nbsp;of Rule 9, the failure to set up such rights resulted in &nbsp;a &nbsp;waiver thereof, and they become barred after the judgment in the possessory action &nbsp;became final. It was, &nbsp;therefore, error &nbsp;on the &nbsp;part of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of Appeals to consider &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;determination of &nbsp;appellee's alleged preferential right &nbsp;constituted a prejudicial question &nbsp;to &nbsp;the execution &nbsp;of &nbsp;the final judgment of ouster against appellee.</p> </blockquote> <p>The &nbsp;argument that Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., had no right to eject respondents &nbsp;lot occupants until &nbsp;and unless &nbsp;it had completely paid to the &nbsp;Deudors the amounts stipulated in the compromise agreement, has &nbsp;no merit. &nbsp;These respondents &nbsp;were not parties to the compromise itself, nor were they &nbsp;entitled &nbsp;to &nbsp;receive &nbsp;such &nbsp;payments. &nbsp;Besides, this Court has already ruled in Deudor &nbsp;<i>vs</i>. Tuason &amp; Co., &nbsp;L-13768, May 30, 1961, that the obligation of Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., to complete such payments became unenforceable by the Deudors' failure to comply with their own &nbsp;obligations under the compromise.</p> <p>As to the &nbsp;supposed expropriation &nbsp;of the Tatalon Estate, it &nbsp;is enough to remark that the Court of &nbsp;Appeals &nbsp;has found &nbsp;that &nbsp;no such expropriation proceedings have been filed; and this Court has ruled &nbsp;that until proceedings for condemnation are &nbsp;fully instituted, and &nbsp;possession of the property is taken over by the condemnor, the enforcement of &nbsp;final decrees of eviction may not be constitutionally suspended (Teresa Realty, Inc. <i>vs</i>. Sison, L-14716, &nbsp;April 23, 1962; J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., <i>vs</i>. &nbsp;Cabildo, L-17163, Oct. 31, 1962; Cuatico <i>vs.</i> Court of Appeals, L-20141, Oct. 31, 1962; Tuason &amp; Co.<span style="font-style: italic;"> &nbsp;vs</span>. Court of Appeals and Land Tenure &nbsp;Administration, &nbsp;L-18128, December 16, &nbsp;1961).</p> <blockquote> <p>"Hence, the mere filing &nbsp;of &nbsp;the condemnation proceedings for the benefit of tenants &nbsp;can not, &nbsp;by itself alone, &nbsp;lawfully suspend the condemnee's dominical rights, whether &nbsp;of possession, enjoyment or disposition. And this is especially the case where final and executory judgments of ejectment have been obtained against the occupants of the property." &nbsp;(Tuason &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Court of Appeals and Land &nbsp;Tenure Administration, L-18128, December 16, 1961).</p> </blockquote> <p>We conclude that the actions brought &nbsp;by respondents &nbsp;lot occupants in the Court &nbsp;of Appeals for the suspension of the executions against them is untenable for lack of jurisdiction &nbsp;in the Appeals Court &nbsp;and lack of merit in their individual petitions.</p> <p>Wherefore, the writs of certiorari prayed for by Tuason &amp; &nbsp;Co., Inc., are hereby &nbsp; granted, &nbsp;and the consolidated decision of the Court of Appeals in the cases above-entitled is hereby annulled &nbsp;and &nbsp;set &nbsp;aside, without prejudice &nbsp;to the appropriate action on the part of the lot occupants to &nbsp;enforce &nbsp;whatever &nbsp;other rights &nbsp;they &nbsp;might &nbsp;have, if any, against J.
