				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two cases arose from related circumstances connected with
the election for Mayor in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kibawe</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> held on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">The first (G. R. No.</span> L-29177) is a petition for
certiorari seeking the annulment of the order of the respondent judge dated
April 1, 1968 declaring null and void the proclamation of peti­tioner as the
duly elected Mayor made by the municipal board of canvassers on March 14, 1968
on the ground that the same was made in excess of the court's
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
second (G. R. No.</span> L-29394) is a petition for certiorari and prohibition
purporting to enjoin the respondent Commis­sion on Elections from requiring
delivery to it and investi­gating and determining the genuineness of the election
re­turns from Precinct 20 of said municipality with a view to their being used
in the canvass of the votes for mayor, based upon the theory that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is without authority to review the finding of a
court in a judicial recount re­garding the condition of the envelop containing
one of the copies of the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We sustain the petitioner in the <span class="GramE">first,</span> We
overrule him in the second.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1967</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Seriña</span> filed with respondent judge a
petition for recount of the votes in Precinct 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated as grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
alleged tam­pering of the returns and discrepancy between the total number of
votes cast in said precinct, as appearing in C. L. Form 40, Minutes of Voting,
on the one hand, and, on the other, the total of the votes cast for all the
candidates for mayor, as appearing in the election returns, the former being
419 and the latter 642, 525 of which were credited to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was amended on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1967</st1:date> to make more
detailed the particulars of the grounds al­ready alleged in the original
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1968</st1:date>, a second amendment
of the petition was attempted but this was denied by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, on December 17, 1967, petitioner
filed his answer challenging the jurisdiction of the court and alleging
insufficiency of the facts alleged to constitute a "cause of action"
under Section 163 of the Revised Election Law, since the petition, even as
amended, does not allege any discrepancy in the numbers of the votes for the different
candidates for mayor in all the extant genuine copies of the returns and, on
the other hand, any discrepancy thereof with what appears in the minutes of
voting is not a ground for judi­cial recount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After proceedings considerably less summary than they should be, on
February 7, 1968, the respondent judge, at first, granted the petition; but,
later, upon motion for reconsideration filed by herein petitioner on February
14, 1967, he reconsidered his previous order and denied the petition on March 13,
1968 ruling thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The pivotal question in this case has definitely been
resolved by the Supreme Court in its decision in the most recent case of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. Commission on Elections, et al., G. R. No. L-28415,
promulgated on January 29, 1968, fixing a divid­ing line between the powers of
the board of canvassers and the Com­mission on Elections on the one hand and
the court of first ins­tance on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The highest tribunal ruled that 'where before or during canvass or
before pro­clamation representations are made that returns are falsified, it be­comes
the primary duty, first of the board of canvassers and then the Commission on
Elections, to ascertain this fact'; that the latter is clothed with broad cons­titutional
powers to have the re­turns corrected in order to secure that only genuine
returns are pre­sented to the board of canvassers for the purpose of canvass
and thus prevent any dastardly attempt to subvert the people's choice with the
use of patently doctored re­turns, while the court of first ins­tance is
delimited by section 163 of the Revised Election Code in the exercise of its
authority to order a recount to situations where an authentic copy of the
election re­turns gives a different number of votes to a candidate from those
appearing in another authentic copy and the difference would affect the result
of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evi­dent that the
remedy available to the petitioner in the present ins­tance lies with the
Commission on Elections and not with this court because no differences in the num­ber
of votes of the respondent Er­nesto <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> that
would affect the result of the election were found in the available copies of
the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of the
corresponding entry in words as to the number of votes received by said respondent
for the Office of Mayor in the municipal treasurer's copy of the election
statement may not be considered a discrepancy within the context of the law suf­ficient
enough to warrant the ap­plication of Section 163 of the Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1968</st1:date>,
allegedly even before respondent <span class="SpellE">Seriña</span> had received
copy of the order of denial, the muni­cipal board of canvassers proclaimed
petitioner Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Villalon</span> as the duly elected
mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This caused the fil­ing of an
omnibus motion for contempt against the members of the municipal board of
canvassers and for annulment of said proclamation by respondent <span class="SpellE">Seriña</span>, and the subsequent issuance by respondent judge of
the disputed order of <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1968</st1:date>,
denying the said prayer for contempt but granting that for annulment of the
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for the
reconsideration of this order was filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1967</st1:date>, but the same was denied on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="6">June
 29, 1968</st1:date>, the present first petition was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assails the order of <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1968</st1:date> insofar as the annulment declared by it is
concerned as having been issued without or in excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is right.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only reason given by respondent judge in support of his order
is that the proclamation "was premature be­cause (the order of March 13)
had not yet become final as the petitioner had not yet even been notified
thereof on <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1968</st1:date>."
Such reason is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in the
very nature of a proceeding for judicial recount of votes in an election that
orders disposing of the petition by either granting the petition and
accordingly proceeding to the actual recount or denying the same, as well as
the order certifying the result of the recount, should not be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has already held that there is no appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Sanidad</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, 23
SCRA, 878, 880).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, only
questions of jurisdiction and of law may be brought to the Supreme Court in
appropriate instances by certiorari, prohibition or mandamus with a request for
the issuance of the corresponding writ of preliminary injunc­tion, if
necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The procedure has been made
summary precisely to accomplish its purpose of aiding the electoral authorities
in ascertaining the apparent results of an election exclusively for purposes of
proclamation without unnecessary loss of time and without prejudice to the
final outcome of a full-dressed determination of the true result of the
election thru an election contest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
this Court in­dicated in <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
22 SCRA 241, judicial recounts must be speedily terminated in order not
"to prolong the periods during which the contested positions will remain
without an occupant, thereby provoking suspicion, conjec­ture and unrest."
This Court emphasized this to these same parties now before Us in <span class="SpellE">Seriña</span> vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>,
a previous case involving practically the same facts as here:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is
not amiss to state, however, that respondent court, its the exercise of its
limited jurisdiction under either Section 163 or 168 of the Revised Election
Code as the case may be, should dispose of the matter with promptness and
dispatch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would assure that the
proclamation would not be unduly delayed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is equally rele­vant to state that under such circum­stances there
should not be on the part of the judiciary timidity and hesitancy in lending
its approval to pleas from any party before it, if thereby the true and honest
result of the elections could be elicited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would enable the provincial or municipal board of canvassers to
discharge its function in the shortest possible time and with the utmost degree
of accuracy." <span class="GramE">( 24</span> SCRA 715, 719.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, this aspect of the electoral process could as well be
performed by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> officials or other public of­ficials
designated by that body or by law, and the only reason why it has been given to
the courts seems to be just to impress solemnity and dignity to its result
which may serve as the basis of a temporary color of title to an elective
office, without implying that the courts should follow the usual cumbersome and
complicated procedure of a judicial proceeding, since, after all, what is
contemplated is more of a mechanical process rather than one requiring the
exercise of judgment and discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Albano</span></st1:place> vs. Provincial Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, 5 SCRA 13, 18-19, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is well to emphasize once again that the authority given
to a court of first instance to allow the recount of votes under Section 163 of
the Revised Election Code is restrictive in nature. The law is explicit that
the proceed­ing is summary in character and merely consists in the mathematical
counting of the votes received by each candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not involve any appreciation of the
ballots or determination of their validity as is required in an election
contest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its only purpose is to count
the number of votes as they appear in the face of the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Cawa</span>, et al. v.
Hon. Vicente <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, et al., G. R. Nos.
L-16837-40, <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1960</st1:date>.)
Thus, as this Court has aptly said: 'The pur­pose of the law is to offer a
prompt re­lief to a simple controversy, that can immediately be settled through
a summary judicial proceeding that may dispense with the long drawn and
complicated pro­ceedings of a full-dressed election con­test and, at the same
time, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to restore
public tranquility by dispelling all doubts as to the true number of votes cast
in a given precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legal tech­nicalities
should be used to help in arriving at a clear intention of the law and not to
defeat said intention'. (Board of Election Inspectors vs. <span class="SpellE">Pic­cio</span>,
81 Phil. 577.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See also <span class="SpellE">Cawa</span>, et al. vs. Hon. Vicente <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario, et al., supra.) (Italics supplied) Verily, in this instance, legal
technicalities were applied to defeat the purpose of the law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar is not the first one where the matter of a
judicial recount has remained pending without final resolution by the courts
far beyond the beginning of the term of office being contested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be admitted that such a situation is
not only undesirable; it is inconsis­tent with the intent and spirit of the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, even a full blown
electoral contest could have been termi­nated within a shorter period since the
elections of 1967; which is absurd, to say the least.</p>

<p class="BODY">A judicial recount is not an action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not, strictly speaking, even a special
proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a part of the
electoral administrative process preparatory to the canvass and proclamation of
the results of an election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that it is performed by the Court of First Instance does not make of it a
purely judicial pro­ceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only that
aspect of it wherein the court determines whether or not the requirements of
the law for a recount are present is judicial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Binging Ho vs. Municipal Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Bongao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, et al., G. R. No.</span>
L­29051, <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1969</st1:date>.)
The exact procedure to be followed after the proper motion is filed is
prescribed neither in the election law nor in the rules of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law merely lays down three requisites for
the exercise of jurisdiction by the court, namely, (1) there must be a
discrepancy bet­ween authentic copies of the election returns from a precinct
in the number of votes given to a candidate and the difference affects the
results of the election; (2) a mo­tion must be filed by the board of canvassers
or by any candidate affected; and (3) notice of the proceeding shall be given
to all the candidates affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
three re­quisites complied <span class="GramE">with,</span> the law evidently
leaves it to the court to devise the means for the exercise of its powers and
the performance of its assigned role in the manner which may appear to it to be
most consistent with the fun­damental purpose of the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The practice of some judges of requiring
pleadings to be filed within specified periods and holding pre-trials is
definitely outside of the contemplation of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not conformable to its spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 6, Rule 135)</p>

<p class="BODY">Barring unusual and inevitable circumstances, this kind of
proceedings should consume hut a number of days, if not hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that the judge has to determine is
whether the copies of the genuine election returns submit­ted to it, tally with
each other or not, as to the votes of the candidates concerned, and if they
don't, he should promptly proceed to have the corresponding ballot box brought
to the court and opened and then count the votes of the candidates for the
office in question as they appear on the face of the ballots found therein
without in any manner applying the rules on appreciation of ballots and without
passing on their validity, which are matters that should be reserved for an
election contest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Cava
et al. vs. Del Rosario, G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-16837, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 30, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; Samson vs. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>, 106 Phil. 1140.)</span>
It is obvious that such a simple function can be performed and finished in a
very short time.</p>

<p class="BODY">These considerations are equally persuasive against allowing any
appeal from the court's orders in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already stated, the purpose of the proceeding is the prompt if not
immediate solution to a problem related to the proclamation of the apparent
winner in an election which as a rule must be made before the term of the
contested office begins, and the matter placed before the judge for action is
so simple that from the very nature of the action the court is required to
take, the principal ingredient of review 9 thereof by a higher court is
wanting, namely, the element of finality in the consequences of the
pronouncements the judge is called upon to make, considering that whatever be
the outcome of the recount and the resolutions of the court in the course
thereof as well as the subsequent canvass based thereon may still be reopened
and passed upon in the ensuing electoral contest should there be any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, whatever resolution the court
may make therein can at best have only provisional legal consequen­ces, not in
any way controlling in the eventual electoral protest case that may follow.</p>

<p class="BODY">For all the foregoing considerations, We hold that respondent
judge erred in holding albeit impliedly that his order of April 1, 1968,
denying the petition for re­count of herein respondent had any period of
finality be­fore it could be executed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We further hold that such kind of order is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and the only way to stop its implementation or
compliance is thru an order of a higher court in an appropriate special remedy
as above in­dicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated,
it is the holding of this Court that immediately after a recount of votes has
been made and certified by the Court of First Instance pursuant to Section 163
and 168 of the Revised Election Code, or after it has issued an order of denial
of the petition for such a recount, the court becomes <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> and is henceforth powerless to issue
any order in connection therewith except, perhaps, such as will insure the
expedient effectuation of its basic order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, sufficient answer to respondent <span class="SpellE">Seriña's</span> contention to the effect that respondent judge’s
annulment order is merely a consequence of the writ of pre­liminary injunction
issued by the latter upon the filing of the petition for recount to say that
said writ lost its force and effect upon the issuance of the order denying the
petition, not only because respondent judge did, in fact, de­clare in the same
order that the said "writ of preliminary in­junction issued by the (this)
Court shall be automatically dissolved", which dissolution is in itself
immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, but also because being a mere
auxiliary remedy to the main petition, it could not have survived beyond the
life of such principal remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the same respondent's contention in his answer
that the proclamation in question was null and void because it was made in
violation of a <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolu­tion of December 20,
1967 ordering the suspension of said proclamation until further orders of the
Commission, and none such has come, it must be clarified that the two pro­ceedings,
the one before the respondent judge and that be fore the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
are distinct and separate ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, the respondent judge did not base his order of annulment on the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution but on the theory alone that his
order of denial of <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1968</st1:date>
had not yet become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this
could have been due to the fact that this point was not raised in the court
below, and it is doubtful if it can be raised for the first time in this
certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has broad powers to enforce its own injunctions by
its own fiat and it would be less productive of confusion and conflict of
authority for the courts to keep off where the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
has already as­sumed its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, it bears repeating here, the authority of the courts under
Section 163 of the Revised Election Code is strictly limited only to the
recount of the votes, if the requisites <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
appear to it to be existent, and whether or not its certification of the results
of the re­count will be utilized properly by the election officials is entirely
another matter which, if necessary, has to be the subject of another entirely
distinct proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the second petition before Us, We do not find any
plausible legal basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner seeks to enjoin the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from investigating the election returns for
Precinct 20, the same one subject of the first petition disposed of above,
allegedly because the Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>
had already made an adverse finding as to its integrity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, it is to be noted that peti­tioner's
pose is quite inconsistent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, which
according to petitioner, found "that the Provincial Treasurer's copy of
the election returns for Precinct No. 20 of <span class="SpellE">Kibawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, was spurious and of doubtful origin for the
reason that it was found only inside the mail box of <span class="SpellE">Malaybalay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, on December 9, 1968, long after the
canvassing of votes for and the procla­mation of the Provincial Officials of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> in the last elections" was made in the
court's order of January 17, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
order was issued only as a preliminary step to the recount sought by respondent
<span class="SpellE">Seriña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner knows very well, however, that precisely upon his own motion,
the order of February 7th which granted the petition for recount, was
reconsidered and set aside in the order of <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1968</st1:date>, which upheld petitioner's contention that
the court had no authority to make the recount requested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not clear to <span class="GramE">Us</span>,
how petitioner can base his challenge against the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
actuation on a proceeding he has successfully challenged to have been conducted
without jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of
January 17th was a denial of a motion to reconsider a previous order of the
court denying, in turn, an earlier motion of respondent <span class="SpellE">Seriña</span>
asking for production of the envelope containing the copy of the return
intended for the Provincial Treasurer in order to be used in the determination
of discrepancy among the genuine copies of the returns, and as the recount was
ultimately denied by the court, for want of jurisdiction, it logically follows
that whatever find­ing the court had made in the process should lose any legal
significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that inasmuch as
the finding relied upon by petitioner was made in an order which was merely
preparatory to a judicial recount which could not be held because the court was
without jurisdiction or would have acted in excess of its jurisdiction, the
same cannot serve any legal purpose, since in law, it is devoid of any exist­ence
whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, the point
raised by peti­tioner regarding the effect of the failure of the parties to
take any appeal from the order of January 17th deserves scant consideration,
for the simple reason that the said order was at best interlocutory and
whatever legal signifi­cance it might have had was completely absorbed in the
final result of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the main basis of the present petition against the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> must fall.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it cannot be overemphasized that proceed­ings under
Section 163 of the Revised Election Code are exclusively for purposes of the
recount therein requested only, hence any ruling of the Court made in the
course thereof cannot have the effect of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> upon proceedings for any other purpose
whether in court or in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is perhaps even more true with respect
to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, in so far as the genuineness of the
returns are concerned, because in <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <u>supra</u>, it was held that the in­vestigation
of this matter pertains peculiarly to the province of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reiterate that:</p>

<blockquote>"3<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appropriately</span> to be drawn then is the line that divides the
powers of the boards of canvassers and the <span class="SpellE">Come­lec</span>,
on the one hand, and the Court of First Instance, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are unprepared to say that the election
law intended that where, in a given precinct, some of the returns are authentic
and others are falsified, both the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and the
Court of First Instance will have concurrent jurisdiction - prior to
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such procedure breeds
confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It detracts so much from the
powers granted the boards of canvassers and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to proceed with dispatch with the work of canvassing and proclama­tion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Where before or during canvassing or before proclamation
representations are made that returns are falsified, it becomes the primary
duty, first of the board of canvassers, and then of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
to ascertain this fact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If finally the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> summarily
finds that there was falsification of the copies to be used for canvassing
purposes, then canvassing must be made upon the basis of authentic copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Be­cause a falsified return
or spurious return amounts to no return at all.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If, on the other hand, the discre­pancy in the returns was
the result of honest mistakes of the board of inspec­tors, two courses of
action are open in the court of first instance:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) a peti­tion for correction of returns with the consent of all the
members of the board of inspectors under Section 154 of the Revised Election
Code [Section 154, Re­vised Election Code, reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Altera­tions the statement.- After the
announcement of the result of the elect­ion in the polling place, the board of
inspectors shall not make any altera­tion or amendment in any of its state­ments,
unless it be so ordered by a competent court.' Unanimity of the board of
inspectors has long been con­sidered to be a requisite to correction under this
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Estrada vs. Na­varro, L-23340
&amp; L-28374, <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1967</st1:date>,
and cases cited therein.] <span class="GramE">and</span> (2) a petition by the
said board or any candidate affected for summary judicial recount under
Sections 163 and 168 of the same Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, in Caution vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, We
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Where the election returns produced by the provincial
treasurer have been shown to have been tampered, and all the other copies
outside the <span class="SpellE">baIlot</span> box have also been shown to have
been tampered or falsified, it is certainly within the power of the Commission
on Elections to issue such order as would ascertain the existence of the
genuine, authentic and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> election re­turns,
and thus open the way for the summary recount of the votes, in accord­ance with
law, for the purposes only of the canvass of the votes and the procla­mation of
the candidate found to have obtained the highest number of votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The purpose of the Revised Election Code is to protect the
integrity of elections and to suppress all evils that may violate its purity
and defeat the will of the voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The Commis­sion on Elections,
by constitutional man­date, must do everything in its power to se­cure a fair
and honest canvass of the votes cast in the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the performance of its duties, the
Commission must be given <span class="GramE">a considerable</span> latitude in
adopting means and methods that will in­sure the accomplishment of the great ob­jective
for which it was created - to promote free, orderly, and honest elect­ions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choice of means taken by the Commission
on Elections, unless they are clearly illegal or constitute grave abuse of
discretion should not be interfered with x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The present case comes squarely within the scope of the powers of
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> thus defined and explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be clearer, should it happen that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> discovers a discrepancy between the returns already
examined by the court, on the one hand, and any other genuine copy there­of not
yet brought to the court, on the other, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
may require the parties concerned to request for a judi­cial recount in spite
of a previous order of denial thereof on the basis only of the formerly extant
copies.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Finally, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, G. R. No.</span> L-19202, February 20,
1962 (decided by resolution), this Court did hold that when there is evidence
that the ballot box and the ballots therein have been tampered prior to a
judicial recount, the recount even if conducted already may be disregarded in
favor of the contents of genuine copies of the returns before the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We make it clear, however, that the finding
of tampering by the court therein served no other end than to make the recount
prayed for pointless, but such finding could not have any binding effect or any
legal significance in the ensuing electoral protest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for certiorari
in G. R. No.</span> L-29177 is granted and the order of respondent judge of
