				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These are actually two (2) separate petitions for certiorari and
prohibition with preliminary injunction but are decided jointly because the
issues presented proceed from the same factual background.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="4">April
 29, 1963</st1:date> the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
(Branch II), Hon. <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>
presiding, rendered a decision in its Special Proceeding No. 4012, which is
hereunder quoted in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote>"This is a petition to have the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span>
Tan <span class="SpellE">Suat</span>, a Chinese National, to be declared a
Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
has been represented by Assistant Fiscal Jose <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the trial it has been established to
the satis­faction of the Court that sometime in the year 1937 petitioner was
legally married to <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Lng</span> <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>, a Filipino citizen; and that the petitioner has all
the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to be­come a Filipino
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the sub­mission of the
evidence for the petitioner, the court inquired from Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>
if he has any opposition to the petition to which the Fiscal answered that he
has no opposi­tion, neither has he any evidence to warrant opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court had it announced to the public if
there is any opposition to the petition of <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span>
Tan Suet to be declared a Filipino citizen and nobody in the crowded courtroom
registered his opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span>
Tan <span class="SpellE">Suat</span> is hereby declared a Filipino citizen by
marriage and the Commissioner of Immigration is hereby or­dered to cancel the
necessary alien certifi­cate of registration and immigrant certi­ficate of
residence of the petitioner and to issue the corresponding identification
card."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same day the same court rendered another similarly worded
decision in its Special Proceeding No. 4013, this time in favor of Chan Po <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Lan</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This second decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"This is a petition to have the peti­tioner Chan Po <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Lan</span></span>, a Chinese National, to be
declared a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General has been represented by Assistant Fiscal Jose <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the
trial it has been established to the satisfaction of the Court that sometime in
the year 1961 petitioner was legally married to Cu Bon <span class="SpellE">Piao</span>,
a Filipino citi­zen; and the petitioner has all the qua­lifications and none of
the disqualifications to become a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the submission of the evidence for the
petitioner, the court inquired from Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span> if
he has any opposition to the petition to which the Fiscal answered that he has
no opposition, neither has he any evidence to warrant any opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court had it announced to the public if
there is any opposition to the peti­tion of Chan PC?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Lan</span></span>
to be declared a Filipino citizen and nobody in the crowded courtroom
registered his opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, petitioner Chan Po <span class="SpellE">Lan</span> is hereby declared a Filipino citizen by marriage and
the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration is hereby ordered to cancel the
necessary alien certificate of registration and immigrant certificate of
residence of the petitioner and to is­sue the corresponding identification
card."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1963</st1:date>
the Solicitor General<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed separate notices of appeal from said decisions, at the same time re­questing
an extension of ten (10) days within which to file the corresponding records on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, because of the un­explained
failure of the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> to forward the records immediately despite repeated
requests <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by the Solicitor General, the
latter, unable to prepare the records on appeal, filed the instant peti­tions
instead, including the Commissioner of Immigration as co-petitioner in view of
the fact that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> parts of the decisions
of the lower court are addressed to him for compliance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1963</st1:date>
we issued in each case a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain execution
and enforcement of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter these two cases were submitted for decision without any
answer from the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents' identical prayer in the lager Court was for
a declaration of their Filipino citizenship and for an order to compel the
Commissioner of Immigration to cancel their respective alien certificates of
registration on the ground that they had married Filipino husbands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In grant­ing the said prayer the lower court
was clearly in error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time
jurisprudence had already set the question at rest: no person claiming to be a
citizen may get a judicial declara­tion of citizenship.</p>

<blockquote>"Under our laws, there can be no action or proceeding for the
judicial declaration of the citizenship of an in­dividual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts of justice exist for the settlement of
<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversies, which imply a given right,
legally demand­able and enforceable, an act or omission <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of said right, and a remedy, granted or sanctioned by law, for said breach of
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an incident only of the
adjudication of the rights of the parties to a controversy, the court may pass
upon, and make a pronouncement relative to, their status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, such a pronouncement is beyond
judicial power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for instance, no
action or proceed­ing may be instituted for a declaration to the effect that
plaintiff, or petitioner is married, or single, or a legitimate child, although
a finding thereon may be made as a necessary premise to justify a given re­lief
available only to one enjoying said status.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At times, the law permits the ac­quisition of a given status, such as
naturalization by judicial decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
there is no similar legislation authorizing the institution of a judicial
proceeding to declare that a given person is part of our citizenry." <span class="GramE">(Tan v. Republic, L-14159, April 18, 1960).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before these cases were submitted for decision the Solicitor
General filed a motion, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1964</st1:date>, to cite the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> for contempt by reason of his failure to
forward the records of these cases to this Court despite our resolution to that
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that after
the said resolution was issued the Clerk did send those records and the same
were received here on <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of contempt has therefore become
moot.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Writs prayed for are hereby granted; the
questioned decisions are set aside and the writs of pre­liminary injunction
previously issued are made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against private respondents.</span></p>
