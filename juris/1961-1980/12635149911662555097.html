R. No. 34826-R. thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record shows that,
after investigating an alleged maul­ing of one Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>,
in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, on October 3, 1964, Benjamin M. <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>, as Assistant Fiscal of said City, filed, in
connection therewith, with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch - hereinafter referred to as CFI -
presided </span><span style="">over </span><span style="">by Hon. Lourdes P.
San Diego, Judge, an information - which was docketed as Criminal Case No.
Q-6029 of said CFI - for frus­trated murder, against <span class="SpellE">Juancho</span>
G. Gutierrez, <span class="SpellE">Celedonio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Cayado</span>
<u>alias</u> Tony <span class="SpellE">Cayado</span>, Alfonso D. <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> <u>alias</u> <span class="SpellE">Panchito</span> Alba,
Benjamin A. Johnson, <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
and three (3) other persons de­signated in said pleading as John Doe, Richard
Doe and Peter Doe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Among those implicated in
the alleged mauling were Modesto Obispo and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>, Assistant City Fiscal and member of the Police
Force respectively, of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; but they were not
named specifically in the information for the reason - stated in a letter of
the City Fiscal to the Secretary of Justice, hereinafter referred to as the
Secretary - "that only the victim Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>
identified them, while his two other witnesses were negative in their
identification of the two, aside from the fact that they were able to present
witnesses to show that they did not participate in the mauling. " The City
Fiscal further stated, in his letter, that the investigation had been set, for
continuation thereof, on October 5, 1964, and that, owing to the danger that
any action taken thereon by his office may be "misinterpreted",
because a member of his staff - Assistant Fiscal Obispo - was involved, he (the
City Fiscal) requested that a special prosecutor of the Department of Justice -
herein­after referred to as the Department - be designated "to continue x <span class="SpellE">x</span> said investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="10">October
 5, 1964</st1:date>, the Secretary designated State Prosecutor, Francisco
Villa, "to assist the city fiscal of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> in the investigation
and prosecution of all the persons responsible for the alleged mauling of
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> <span style="">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span>On the
same date, Villa proceeded to conduct the investigation, which he resumed on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, he recommended to the Secretary
the dismissal of the case, in so far as Obispo and <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
were concerned, upon the ground that Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>
had refused to testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
recommendation was, however, dis­approved by the Secretary, who instructed the
prosecution to do everything possible to secure <span class="SpellE">Abella's</span>
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1964</st1:date>, the city fiscal
issued a memorandum directing <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> and Villa to sit
together and <span style="">resume the investigation,
as well as report thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="10"><span style="">October
 </span>19, 1964</st1:date>, the defendants designated in the in­formation by
their true names were arraigned before the CFI.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">On this occasion, Judge San
Diego asked Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>, about the
identity of the persons referred to in said pleading as John Doe, Richard Doe
and Peter Doe <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> replied that the first two (2)
were Assistant City Fiscal Modesto Obispo and Patrol­man <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>, respectively - hereinafter referred to
collectively as the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, Judge San Diego au­thorized <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
to cross out the conventional names John Doe and Richard Doe, in the
information, and write, instead, "Fiscal Mo­desto Obispo" and
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>",
which <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, the warrants for their arrest were issued, on motion </span><span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Grecia</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents forthwith moved to set aside said warrants of arrest,
but, the motion was denied on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="10">October
 20, 1964</st1:date>; whereupon, respondents posted their respective bail
bonds, and moved to quash the information, upon the ground of absence of a
preliminary in­vestigation and the consequent lack of authority to file said
plead­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After listening to the
argument of respondents counsel, when said motion was heard on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1964</st1:date>, Judge San Diego
stated that, "not being founded on the grounds provided by the Rules of
Court, " the motion would "have to be denied. " As said counsel
requested some time to file a motion for reconsideration, Judge <span style="">San Diego remarked that she saw no need <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, if the arguments adduced that morning would
merely be reiterated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She, however,
allowed </span>Atty. Marvin Hill to appear as <u>amicus</u> <u>curiae</u> and
submit, not later than <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="11">November 2,
 1964</st1:date>, a memorandum in support of said motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <st1:city><st1:place>San Diego</st1:place></st1:city>
further announced that the written order thereon would be issued on <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1964</st1:date> - as, in fact, it
was then issued - on which date respondents would be arraigned and should be
ready for trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents, however, filed, with the Court of Appeals, on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1964</st1:date>, a petition,
docketed as CA-G. R. No. 34826-R, for "certiorari, prohibition and
injunction, " to annul the information against them and restrain Judge San
Diego and Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> from proceeding
with their (respondents' arraignment and trial in said Criminal Case No.
Q-6029.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On No­vember 3, 1964, a division
of the Court of Appeals passed a reso­lution requiring said Judge and Assistant
Fiscal to answer the peti­tion therein and, upon the filing of a P500 bond,
issued a "summons with" the "writ of preliminary
injunction" prayed for by respond­ents herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 12, 1964, Judge San Diego and Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>, in turn, filed, with the Supreme Court, the present
action for "certiorari, prohibition and injunction, " against the
respondents and the Members of the Division of the Court of Appeals that passed
said resolution and authorized the issuance of the writ aforementioned, to
annul both, upon the ground of grave abuse of discretion, amounting to excess
of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for in the
petition herein, we issued <span style="">a </span>writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Court of
Appeals from further proceedings in said CA-G. R. No. 34826-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents alleged in their petition therein that the amended
information against them is null and void:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) because they were given no preliminary investigation, before being
in­cluded in said pleading, and (2) because <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
allegedly "lost all authority to amend the information" by including
therein res­pondents herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The infirmity of the last ground was manifest on the very face of
<span style="">said petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,<span style=""> </span>respondents quoted therein section <span style="">2 of Republic Act No. 1198, pursuant to which "State Attorneys
shall <u>only assist or collaborate</u> with the Provincial Fiscal or city
attorney unless otherwise expressly directed and authorized by the Secretary of
Justice, " and it is not alleged in said pleading that the latter had thus
"otherwise expressly directed and authorized state attorney" Villa,
as regards the alleged mauling of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Villa was merely "designated to
<u>assist</u> the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, "
so that the latter, and, on his behalf, Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span>
<u>retained control</u> over the prose­cution in Criminal Case No. Q-6029.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first ground, it is worthy of notice that the
Constitution does not require the holding of preliminary investigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right thereto exists only, <u>if and when
</u>created by statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When</u> so
created, the absence of a preliminary investigation - if it is not waived - may
amount to a denial of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this connection,
Section 38 of the Revised Charter of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Every person arrested shall, without unneces­sary delay, be
brought before the City Attorney, the municipal court, or the Court of First
Instance for preliminary hearing, release on bail, or trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> In case <span class="SpellE">triable</span> only in the Court of First Instance the defendant
shall <u>not</u> be entitled as of right to pre­liminary examination in any
case where the Fiscal of the city, after a due investigation of, the facts,
shall have presented <span style="">an information
against </span>him in proper form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the Court of First Instance may make such summary investigation into the case
as it may deem necessary to enable it to fix the bail or to determine whether
the offense is <span class="SpellE">bailable</span>. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the defendant in a case "<span class="SpellE">triable</span>
only in the Court of First Instance" of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, "shall <u>not</u> be entitled as of right to preliminary
investigation <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>where the Fiscal of the City, after due
investigation of the facts, shall have presented an information against him in,
proper form."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
such investigation had been conducted and said "information in proper
form" was filed by the "Fiscal of the City. "<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the action of Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> in inserting, in the information in Criminal Case
No. Q-6029, the true names of those accused there­in as John Doe and Richard
Doe, and the authority given <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by Judge San
Diego, are <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of neither the Fundamental Law
nor the statutes, and do not constitute a denial of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words the petition in CA-G. R. No. 34826-R failed to set
up a cause of action, because the law relevant to the subject-matter of every
pleading - and, hence, the Revised Charter of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, as regards said petition - must be con­sidered as part and parcel of the
allegations thereof,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals had
abused, therefore, its discretion so gravely as to have ex­ceeded its
jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the cases cited in respondents' petition <span style="">in </span>CA-G.R.
No. 34826-R are not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conde</span> v. Judge of First Instance<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
was concerned mainly with the harassment visited upon the accused and a denial
of speedy trial, through substantial amendments of the information, by <u>changing
the nature of the </u><u><span style="">crime charged</span></u><span style=""> </span>therein, and the filing of new
charges, without a preliminary investigation, after the dismissal of those
originally filed, as well as undue <u>delays in proceeding with the hearing</u>
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the one at bar,
respondents seek to <u><span style="">prevent their</span></u><span style=""> </span>trial under an information the
allegations of which, as regards the nature of the crime charged, have <u>never</u>
been changed or amended.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Marfori</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> an information was filed in the court of
first instance after the <u>dismissal</u> of the complaint by the justice of the
peace who conducted the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the justice of the peace
who conducted the preliminary investigation in U. S. v. <span class="SpellE">Banzuela</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> found that "there were no grounds for
believing that" the "accused was guilty of the crime charged against
him, " and, accordingly, ordering his release, thus, in effect, dismissing
the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. Red,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <u>no</u> preliminary investigation was ever
made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of
respondents herein, Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Grecia</span> had
conducted an investigation, and had not dismissed, either ex</span>pressly <span style="">or </span>impliedly, the charges against
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, he <u>included</u>
them in the information, although under the convent­ional names of John Doe and
Richard Doe, and their true names were not revealed [u]<span class="SpellE">ntil</span>
the arraignment of their co-defendants, on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lastly, none of the aforementioned cases involved the application of a
provision analogous to that of the <span style="">Revised
Charter of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, explicitly <u>denying</u> the
right to a preliminary investigation </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">cases <span class="SpellE">triable</span> only in the Court of First
Instance thereof, where the prosecutor, after due investi</span>gation of the
facts, shall have filed an information against him in proper form.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the writ of preliminary injunction issued by
