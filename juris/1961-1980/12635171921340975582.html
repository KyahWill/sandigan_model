				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is before us on appeal by certiorari from the decision of
the Court of Appeals affirming that of the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City, convicting <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Reyesof</span> the crimes of grave threats and grave oral defa­mation,

<p class="BODY">The petitioner herein, <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> Reyes,
was a former civilian employee of the Navy Exchange, <span class="SpellE">Sangley</span>
Point, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, whose services were terminated
on <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of June 6, 1961, be led a
group of about 20 to 30 persons in a demonstration staged in front of the main
gate of the United States Naval Station at <span class="SpellE">Sangley</span>
Point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They carried placards bearing
statements such as, "Agustin, <span class="SpellE">mamatay</span> ka;"
"To, <span class="SpellE">alla</span> boss con Nolan;" "Frank do
not be a common funk;" "Agustin, <span class="SpellE">mamamatay</span>
ka <span class="SpellE">rin</span>;" "Agustin, Nolan for you;"
"Agustin, <span class="SpellE">alla</span> <span class="SpellE">bos</span> con
Nolan;" "Agustin, <span class="SpellE">dillega</span> el <span class="SpellE">dia</span> <span class="SpellE">di</span> guide <span class="SpellE">rin</span>
<span class="SpellE">bo</span> <span class="SpellE">chiquiting</span>;" and
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The base com­mander, Capt.
McAllister, called up Col. Patricia <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span>, who as
Philippine Military <span class="SpellE">Liason</span> Officer at <span class="SpellE">Sangley</span> Point was in charge of preserving harmonious
relations between the personnel of the naval station and the civilian
population of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. McAllister requested Col. <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span> to join him at the main gate of the base to meet the
demonstra­tors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Col. <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span>
went to the place and talked to <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> Reyes and one
Luis Buenaventura.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon learning that
the demonstration was not directed against the naval station but against
Agustin <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span> and a certain Frank Nolan for their
having allegedly caused the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span>
Reyes from the Navy Exchange, Col. <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span> suggested
to them to demonstrate in front of <span class="SpellE">Hallare's</span>
residence, but they told him that they would like the people in the station to
know how they felt about <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span> and Nolan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They assured him, however, that they did not
intend to use violence, as "they just wanted to blow off steam."</p>

<p class="BODY">At that time Agustin <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span> was in his
office inside the naval station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
learned about the demonstration he became apprehensive about his safety, so he
sought Col. <span class="SpellE">Monzon's</span> protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The colonel thereupon escorted <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span>, his brother, and another person in going out of
the station, using his (<span class="SpellE">Konzon's</span>) car for the
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once outside, Col. <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span> purposely slowed down to accommodate the request of
Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span>
to take a good look at the demonstrators and at the placards they were
carrying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the demonstrators saw <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span> they shouted, "<span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span>
<span class="SpellE">si</span> Agustin." Then they boarded their jeeps and
followed the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One jeep overtook and
passed the car while the other two trailed behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span> and
his companions had alighted in front of his residence at <st1:address><st1:street>967
  Burgos St.</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Col.</st1:country-region></st1:address> <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span> sped away.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three jeeps carrying the demonstrator’s parked in front of <span class="SpellE">Hallare’s</span> residence after being gone by it twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> Reyes got
off his jeep and posted himself at the gate, and with his right hand inside his
pocket and his left holding the gate-door, he shouted repeatedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Agustin, <span class="SpellE">putang</span>
<span class="SpellE">ina</span> mo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Agustin, <span class="SpellE">mawawala</span> ka.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agustin <span class="SpellE">lumabas</span> ka,
<span class="SpellE">papatayin</span> <span class="SpellE">kita</span>."
Thereafter, he boarded his jeep and the motorcade left the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span>,
frightened by the demeanor of Reyes and the other demonstrators, stayed inside
the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing events <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span>
Reyes was charged on July 24 and 25, 1961 with grave threats and grave oral
defamation, respectively (Criminal Cases Nos. 2594 and 2595, Municipal Court of
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned City Fiscal of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> accuses <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> Reyes of
the crime of Grave Threats, as defined by Article 282 of the Revised Penal Code

Counsel"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to both charges and
the cases were set for joint trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the day of the hearing the prosecution moved to amend the information in
Criminal Case No. 2594 for grave threats by deleting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the word "orally".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
counsel objected to the motion on the ground that the accused had already been
arraigned on the original information and that the amendment "would affect
materially the interest of the accused." Nevertheless, the amendment was
allowed and the joint trial proceeded.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the judgment of conviction the accused appealed to the Court
of Appeals, which returned a verdict of <span class="SpellE">affirm­ance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration having been
denied, the accused brought this appeal by certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner avers that the Court of Appeals erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in affirming the proceedings in the lower
court allowing the substantial amendment of the information for grave threats
after petitioner had been arraigned on the original information; (2) in proceeding
with the trial of the case of grave threats without first requiring petitioner
to enter his plea on the amended information; (3) in convicting petitioner of
both offenses when he could legally be convicted of only one offense, thereby
putting him in jeopardy of being penalized twice for the same offense; (4) in
convicting petitioner of grave threats when the evidence adduced and considered
by the court tend to establish the offense of light threats only; and (5) in
convicting petitioner of grave oral defamation when the evidence tend to
establish that of simple slander only.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first error assigned, the rule is that after the accused
has pleaded the information may be amended as to all matters of form by leave
and at the discretion of the court, when the same can be done without prejudice
to the rights of the defendant (Section 13, Rule 110, New Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amendments tat touch upon matters of
substance cannot be permitted after the plea is entered.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful consideration of the original inform­ation, we
find that all the elements of the crime of grave threats as defined in Article
282<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Revised Penal Code and penalized by its paragraph 2 were alleged therein
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the offender threatened
another person with the infliction upon his person of a wrong; (2) that such
wrong amounted to a crime; and (3) that the threat was not subject to a
condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence petitioner could, have
been convicted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> it is to be noted that
under the aforementioned provision the particular manner in which the threat is
made not a qualifying ingredient of the offense, such that the deletion of the
word "orally" did not affect the nature and essence of the crime as
charged originally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did it
change the basic theory of the prosecution that the accused threatened to kill <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> Reyes so as to require the peti­tioner to undergo
any material change or modification in his defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to his claim, made with the
concurrence of the Solicitor General, petitioner was not exposed after the
amendment to the danger of conviction under paragraph 1 of Article 282, which
provides for a different penalty, since there was no allegation in the amended
information that the threat was made subject to a condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our view the deletion of the word
"orally" was effected in order to make the information conformable to
the evidence to be presented during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was merely a formal amendment which in no way prejudiced petitioner's
rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next contends that even assuming that the amendment
was properly allowed, the trial court committed a reversible error in
proceeding with the trial on the merits without first requiring him to enter
his plea to the amended information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, however, that the amendment was not substantial, no second
plea was necessary at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third and fourth issues are related and will be discussed
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner avers that the
appellate court erred in affirming the decision of the trial court convicting
him of grave threats and of grave oral defamation when be could legally be convicted
of only one offense, and in convicting him of grave threats at all when the
evidence ad­duced and considered by the court indicates the commission of light
threats only.</p>

<p class="BODY">The demonstration led by petitioner against Agustin <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span> in front of the main gate of the naval station; the
fact that placards with threatening statements were carried by the
demonstrators; their persistence in trailing <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span>
in a motorcade up to his residence; and the demon­stration conducted in front
thereof, culminating in repeated threats flung by petitioner in a loud voice,
give rise to only one conclusion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that
the threats were made "with the deliberate purpose of creating in the mind
of the person threatened the belief that the threat would be carried into
effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span> became so apprehensive of his safety
that he sought the protection of Col. <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span>, who had
to escort him home, wherein he stayed while the de­monstration was going
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that the threats
were made deliberately and not merely in a tem­porary fit of anger, motivated
as they were by the dismissal of petitioner one month before the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, therefore, hold that the appellate court
was correct in upholding peti­tioner's conviction for the offense of grave
threats.</p>

<p class="BODY">The charge of oral defamation stemmed from the utterance of the
words, "Agustin, <span class="SpellE">putang</span> <span class="SpellE">ina</span>
mo".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a common enough
expression in the dialect that is often employed, not really to slander but
rather to express anger or displeasure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is seldom, if ever, taken in its literal sense by the hearer, that
is, as a reflection on the virtues of a mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case, it should be viewed as part of the threats voiced
by appellant against Agustin <span class="SpellE">Hallare</span>, evidently to
make the same more emphatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of <span class="SpellE">Yebra</span>, G. R. No. L-14348, <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9">Sept. 30, 1960</st1:date>, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The letter containing the allegedly libelous remarks is more
threatening than libelous and the intent to threaten is the principal aim and
object to the letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The libelous
remarks contained in the letter, if so they be considered, are merely
preparatory remarks culminating in the final threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the libelous remarks express
the heat of passion which engulfs the writer of the letter, which heat of
passion in the latter part of the letter culminates into a threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is more important and serious offense
committed by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances the Court be­lieves, after the study of the whole letter, that
the offense committed therein is clearly and principally that of threats and
that the state­ments therein derogatory to the person named do not constitute
an independent crime of libel, for which the writer maybe prosecuted separately
from the threats and which should be considered as part of the more important
offense of threats.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing ruling applies with equal force to the facts of the
present case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed
and petitioner is acquitted, with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
insofar as Criminal Case No. 2595 of the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> (for oral
defamation) is concerned; and affirmed with respect to Criminal Case No. 2594,
for grave threats, with costs against petitioner.</p>
