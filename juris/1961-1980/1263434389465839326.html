				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, and <i>mandamus</i>
with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
allege that respondent Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Nabdar</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Malik</span> of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sulu</span></span><span style="">, acted without jurisdiction, in excess of jurisdiction
and with grave abuse of discretion when:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">he</span> held in the
preliminary investigation of the charges of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
filed by respondents Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Amin</span>, Tan <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kao and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajor</span> against petitioners that there was a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
case against the latter;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">he</span> issued warrants
of arrest against petitioners after making the above determination; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">he</span> undertook to
conduct trial on the merits of the charges which were docketed in his court as
Criminal Cases No. <span class="GramE">M-111, M-183 and M-208.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge is said to have acted without jurisdiction, in
excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion because the facts
recited in the complaints did not constitute the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
and assuming they did, they were not within the jurisdiction of the respondent
judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="5">May
 23, 1979</st1:date>, we required respondents to comment on the petition and
issued a temporary restraining order against the respondent judge from further
proceeding with Criminal Cases Nos. M-111, M-183 and M-208 or from enforcing
the warrants of arrest he had issued in connection with said cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Comments by the
respondent judge and the private respondents pray for the dismissal of the
petition but the Solicitor General has manifested that the People of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> have no objection to the grant of the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for, except the damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We considered the comments as answers and
gave </span>due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The position of the Solicitor General is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to grant the petition in order to prevent
manifest injustice and the exercise of palpable excess of authority.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Criminal Case No.</span> M-111, respondent
Rosalinda M. <span class="SpellE">Amin</span> charges petitioners Yam <span class="SpellE">Chee</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiong</span> and Yam Yap <span class="SpellE">Kieng</span> with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through
misappropriation of the amount of P50,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the complaint states on its face that said petitioners received the
amount from respondent Rosalinda M. <span class="SpellE">Amin</span> "as a
loan." <span class="GramE">Moreover, the complaint in Civil Case No.</span>
N-5, an independent action for the collection of the same amount filed by
respondent Rosalinda M. <span class="SpellE">Amin</span> with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1975</st1:date>, likewise states that the P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was a "simple business loan" which earned
interest and was originally demandable six (6) months from <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Annex E of the petition.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Criminal Case No.</span> M-183, respondent
Tan <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kao charges petitioners Yam <span class="SpellE">Chee</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiong</span>, Jose Y.C. Yam, <span class="SpellE">Ampang</span> <span class="SpellE">Mah</span>, and Anita Yam, alias
Yong <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>, with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
through mis­appropriation of the amount of P30,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the complaint states on its face that
the P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was "a simple loan." So does
the complaint in Civil Case No. N-8 filed by respondent Tan <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>
Kao on April 6, 1976 with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>
for the collection of the same amount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Annex D of the petition.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Criminal Case No.</span> M-208, respondent <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajor</span> charges petitioners
Jose Y. C. Yam, Anita Yam alias Yong Tai <span class="SpellE">Mah</span>, <span class="SpellE">Chee</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiong</span> Yam and Richard Yam,
with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through misappropriation of the amount of
P20,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the complaints in the
other two cases, the complaint in Criminal Case No. M-208 does not state that
the amount was received as loan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in a sworn statement dated <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1976</st1:date>, submitted to respondent judge to
support the complaint, respondent <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajor</span> states that the amount was a "loan." (Annex
G of the petition.)</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioners that the facts alleged in the three
criminal complaints do not constitute <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through
misappropriation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> through misappropriation is
committed according to Article 315, paragraph 1, subparagraph (b), of the
Revised Penal Code as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 315.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Swindling (<span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of
the means mentioned herein below shall be punished by:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">xxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence,
namely:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">xxx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By misappropriating or converting, to the
prejudice of another, money, goods, or any other personal property received by
the offender in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any
other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same,
even though such obligation be totally or partially guaranteed by a bond; or by
denying having received such money, goods, or other property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In order that a person can be convicted under the above-quoted
provision, it must be proven that he has the obligation to deliver or return
the same money, goods or personal property that he received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners had no such obligation to return
the same money, i.e., the bills or coins, which they received from private
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because as
clearly stated in criminal complaints, the related civil complaints and the
supporting sworn statements, the sums of money that petitioners received were
loans.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of simple loan is defined in Articles 1933 and 1953 of
the Civil Code.</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1933.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- By the
contract of loan, one of the parties delivers to another, either something not
consumable so that the latter may use the same for a certain time and return
it, in which case the contract is called a <span class="SpellE">commodatum</span>;
or money or other consumable thing, upon the condition that the same amount of
the same kind and quality shall be paid, in which case the contract is simply
called a loan or <span class="SpellE">mutuum</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Commodatum</span> is essentially gratuitous.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Simple loan may be gratuitous or with a stipulation to pay
interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <span class="SpellE">commodatum</span> the <span class="SpellE">bailor</span>
retains the ownership of the thing loaned, while in simple loan, ownership
passes to the borrower."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A person
who receives a loan of money or any other fungible thing acquires the ownership
thereof, and is bound to pay to the creditor an equal amount of the same kind
and quality."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can be readily noted from the above-quoted provisions that in
simple loan (<span class="SpellE">mutuum</span>), as contrasted to <span class="SpellE">commodatum</span>, the borrower acquires ownership of the money,
goods or personal property borrowed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being the owner, the borrower can dispose of the thing borrowed (Article
248, Civil Code) and his act will not be considered misappropriation thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>, 19 Phil. 559, 560 (1911), this Court held
that it is not <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> for a person to refuse to pay
his debt or to deny its existence.</p>

<blockquote>"We <span style="">are of the </span>opinion
and so decide that when the relation is purely that of debtor and creditor, the
debtor can not be held liable for the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
under said article, by merely refusing to pay or by denying <span style="">the indebtedness.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that respondent judge failed to appreciate the
distinction between the two types of loan, <span class="SpellE">mutuum</span> and
<span class="SpellE">commodatum</span>, when he performed the questioned
acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He mistook the transaction between
petitioners and respondents Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Amin</span>, Tan <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kao and <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajor</span> to be <span class="SpellE">commodatum</span> wherein
the borrower does not acquire ownership over the thing borrowed and has the
duty to return the same thing to the lender.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Sec. 87 of the Judiciary Act, the municipal court of a
provincial capital, which the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>
<span style="">is, </span>has
jurisdiction over criminal cases where the penalty provided by law does not
exceed <span class="SpellE">prision</span> correctional or imprisonment for not
more than six (6) years, or fine not exceeding P6,000.00 or both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amounts allegedly misappropriated by
petitioners range from P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P50,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty for misappropriation of this
magnitude exceeds <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>
or 6-year imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 315,
Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming then that
the acts recited in the complaints constitute the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span> has no juris­diction to
try them on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged
offenses are under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
being the sovereign authority can not be sued for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are immune from such type of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the other respondents, this Court is not the proper
forum for the consideration of the claim for damages against them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby granted; the temporary
restraining order previously issued is hereby made permanent; the criminal
complaints against petitioners are hereby declared null and void; respondent
judge is hereby ordered to dismiss said criminal cases and to recall the
warrants of arrest he had issued in connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, respondent judge is hereby rebuked
for manifest ignorance of elementary law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let a copy of this decision be included in his personal file.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against private
respondents.</span></p>
