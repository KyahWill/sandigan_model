				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Ng Liam Keng <i>alias</i> Jose Tangconkong seeks Philippine citizenship in a 
petition filed before the Court of First Instance of Rizal. This petition is 
supported by the affidavits of Narciso Peña, a lawyer, and Ramon L. Echem, a 
businessman.
<p>After hearing, the court dismissed the petition holding that petitioner 
failed to comply with all the statutory requirements necessary to qualify him. 
to become a Filipino citizen. The grounds on which the trial court predicated 
the dismissal of the petition are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) There is no proof showing the laws of China allowing Filipinos to be 
citizens of the Republic of China;</p>
<p>"(2) That his certificate (Exh. J) of arrival was not authentic, for if it 
were so, the date and the month of his arrival should have been shown. Even the 
applicant himself proved the very doubt of the court when, in answer to a 
question propounded to him applicant said, 'that the certificate (Exh. J) does 
not reflect the true facts'. (See pp. 144-147 t.s.n.). Even the applicant 
himself does not remember the date, although according to him, <i>he thinks</i> 
it was on November, 1919 (p. 144, t.s.n.). The court takes judicial notice of 
the fact that, records of arrival were burned during the last war ,and this fact 
is substantiated by the very statement of. the applicant (t.s.n., p. 145). When 
the applicant was asked about his landing certificate, he could not account for 
it, hence the court rejected the admission of the certificate of arrival (Exh. 
J) for it does not reflect the date and month of Ttis arrival and, the insertion 
of the SS/Taiseng and the year appearing in the said certificate (Exh. J) does 
not reflect from any authentic entries that the Immigration office had under its 
control and possession, as correctly stated by the applicant himself.</p>
<p>"(3) It is a fact that the applicant was permitted to use Ng Liam Keng with1 
his alias name Jose Tangconkong in an order of the Court of First Instance of 
Quezon City (Judge Castelo), as shown in the order (Exh. D) dated October 18, 
1948, yet in his income taxes (Exhs. 1, 2 and 3), for three, years he did not 
use his real name Ng Liam Keng but only his alias name Jose Tangconkong, in open 
violation of the order herein indicated. (See order of October 18, 1948). The 
same thing holds true in his Residence Certificate marked as Exhibits R, R-1 and 
R-2, except that for 1957. It is, however, clear from the testimony of Ills 
witness lawyer, Mr. Narciso Peña, that even before the application for the use 
of his alias name, said applicant never used his real name in transactions but 
the alias name of Jose Tangconkong, It seems that, what impels him to apply for 
citizenship was no other than to protect his interest (See deed of sale Exh. Q) 
title into his name, when the acquisition of the same was made since 1943 
(Japanese occupation). Naturally, once naturalized, the acquisition of the said 
property could be legalized.</p>
<p>"(4) There are nine children listed in the application. The first six 
children carry the surname Ng but the remaining three children have the surname 
of Tang, the discrepancies of their differences were never explained into the 
records of the case, beside the last child listed as Tan Soat Ha has no birth 
certificate and yet no explanation was offered by applicant. Let us take Ng Sing 
Chin, the birth certificate shows that his name wag different from that shown in 
Exhibit 1-1. While as regards Ng Soat Eng the data appearing in the application 
is December 20th, was not the same as the one appearing in Exhibit I—3, which is 
December 30th, and yet, no explanation was offered by the applicant to explain 
the discrepancies.</p>
<p>"(5) From the evidence disclosed, the applicant did not evince a sincero 
desire to learn and embrace Filipino customs, traditions and ideals, as his 
memory on historical facts in this country are completely ignored by 
him."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner has appealed and now contends that the lower court erred:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) In holding in effect that it was necessary to show that the laws of China 
allow Filipinos to be citizens of the Republic of China;</p>
<p>(2) In holding that petitioner-appellant's certificate of arrival (Exh. J) 
was not authentic just because it did not contain the date and the month of his 
arrival in the Philippines;</p>
<p>(3) In holding that because appellant used his <i>alias</i> name Jose 
Tangconkong, instead of his real name Ng Liam Keng, appellant was impelled to 
apply for citizenship only to protect his interests;</p>
<p>(4) In holding against appellant his failure to explain why his first six 
children carried the surname of "Ng" while the three younger children carried 
the ssurname of "Tang";</p>
<p>(5) In holding that appellant did not evince a sincere desire to learn and 
embrace Filipino customs, traditions and ideals just because he failed to 
remember some historical facts regarding this country; and</p>
<p>(6) In denying with prejudice appellant's application for Filipino 
citizenship when he has all tire qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications therefor.</p></blockquote>
<p>The contention that the trial court erred in holding that it wag necessary 
for petitioner to show that the laws of China allow Filipinos to be citizens of 
that country is well taken for this Court has already held that such is not 
necessary it being sufficient that he submit proof that he is a citizen of 
Nationalist China.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Petitioner's 
contention that the lower court erred in holding that his certificate of arrival 
Exhibit J was not authentic just because it does not contain the date and the 
month of his arrival in the Philippines is likewise well-taken considering that 
said certificate expressly states that he arrived in Manila in 1919 and the same 
was issued by the Bureau of Immigration.</p>
<p>With regard, however, to the other errors assigned which in substance aim to 
show that the lower court erred in dismissing the petition, suffice it for us to 
state the following reasons in justification for such action.</p>
<p>To begin with, petitioner has shown a deficient knowledge in writing the 
national language and in speaking and writing the English language. Thus, while 
in his direct examination he testified in Tagalog, however, when tested as to 
his knowledge to write said language he demonstrated a brazen inability to do so 
as shown by the fact that when the court dictated to him during the trial a 
sentence taken from an English magazine for him to translate and write in the 
Tagalog dialect he was not able to make the translation, nor write it aa 
required, which shows that he does not write such language as required by law. 
The same shortcoming is evinced by him insofar as his knowledge of the English 
language is concerned. In the first place, he testified in Tagalog when he could 
have given his answers directly in English to obviate the use of an interpreter. 
The most that he did to show his knowledge of that language is to write in 
English the translation of the sentence, "Ako ay may asawa", which he did 
correctly by writing "I have a wife." Such test is indeed insufficient to show 
that he speaks and writes that language with such proficiency as required by 
law. Much less can be said of his alleged knowledge of Spanish for the proof on 
this matter is nil. In the circumstances, we hold that petitioner has failed to 
show satisfactorily that he possesses the requisite language qualification.</p>
<p>We also find correct the observation of the lower court that petitioner 
committed a violation of the <i>Alias</i> Law, or Commonwealth Act No. 142, for 
his failure to use both his real name Ng Liam Keng and his authorized 
<i>alias</i> Jose Tangconkong as expressly decreed in the order of the court. It 
appears that, contrary to said order, and in violation of the spirit of the law, 
he interchangeably used either name in some of his business transactions, and 
not jointly as should have been done, thus giving rise to the suspicion that he 
has done it imbued by an improper design.</p>
<p>Finally, petitioner's two character witnesses have not satisfactorily 
established that they know him sufficiently well during the requisite period the 
law requires them to have known him to be able to act as such. The record shows 
that witness Peña became acquainted with petitioner because he acted for a brief 
period as his counsel and has gone to his store occasionally but has not been 
able to point out specific dates of personal and social visits or contact which 
would demonstrate their close association. To the same effect is the testimony 
of witness Echem who apparently became acquainted with petitioner in view only 
of the circumstance that they had been neighbors for about 5 years, or from 1940 
to 1945. We cannot therefore affirm with a degree of certainty that said 
witnesses can qualify as insurers of his moral character as is required in a 
petition for naturalization.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
appellant.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera,

<p><b>DE LEON, J.:</b></p>
<p>Before this Court is a "Motion for Partial Reconsideration" of our decision 
affirming the dismissal "with prejudice" made by the Court of First Instance of 
Rizal on the herein movant's petition for naturalization. The motion prays that 
the said decision be reconsidered in the sense that petitioner may, if he so 
desires, file another application for naturalization in accordance with law, 
provided that he has all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications 
therefor.</p>
<p>Considering that the grounds relied upon in the motion appear to be valid and 
meritorious, let the decision in Ng Liam Keng <i>alias</i> Jose Tangconkong 
<i>vs.</i> Republic of the Philippines, G. R. No. L-14146, promulgated on April 
29, 1961, be amended, so that the dispositive portion thereof shall read as 
follows:</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the lower court dismissing the petition for 
naturalization is affirmed, but with the modification that the dismissal shall 
be without prejudice, with costs against appellant.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., 
Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</em> and 
<em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
