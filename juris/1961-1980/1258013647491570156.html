				[ Adm. Case No. 504, November 29, 1961</h4>
				<H3>EUFROSINO L. RAMOS, PETITIONER, VS. EUGENIO P. MICULOB, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The verified complaint filed by petitioner, Eufrosino L. Ramos, a
member of the bar, against respondent Eugenio P. Miculob, also a member
of the bar, alleges that in a sworn statement addressed to the
Secretary of Foreign Affairs on July 6, 1961, said respondent stated,
among other things, that in December, 1960, he gave Jose Former,
Philippine Consul General in Hongkong, the sum of HK $2,500.00 in order
to secure the issuance of a visa for his client, one John Lau, alias
Lau Chen Ping, an applicant for a visa to the Philippines; that if
true, the act committed by respondent constitutes malpractice, gross
misconduct, bribery, and a violation of his oath of office as a member
of the bar. 
<p>It appears, however, that the matter is still pending investigation
in the Department of Foreign Affairs by reason of the charges filed by
respondent against Consul General Fornier and Consuls Sabalones and
Cataumber.</p>
<p>For the reason stated in the preceding paragraph, it is hereby
resolved to dismiss the present case, without prejudice to filing it
again if the decision that will be rendered in due time upon the
administrative charges heretofore mentioned would so justify.</p>
<em>Bengzon, C, J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes,</em> and <em>De Leon, JJ.,</em> concur.
