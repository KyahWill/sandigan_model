<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
main <span style="">defenses interposed below </span>by
appellant, the trial court said the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stated in order to demand from the defendant, separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="4">April

separated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The im­portant reason </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">the fact that the plain­tiffs after the defunct Times Film

<blockquote>"Besides, when Times Film Exchange totally ceased operation of

<blockquote><span style="">"The plaintiffs denied

continuing their work as such employees during the transition period of
changing the management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
practically a change of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was merely to change the hands of administration and consequently, the
employees are en­titled to the protection of Republic Act 1052, as amended by
Republic Act No. 1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span style="">not also a mere closing of an enterprise,
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if there was change of
ownership, and the contract of transfer of sale of the enterprise from the
first owner to the buyer did not mention about the fate of the employees affected,
the employees are protected or got to be pro­tected </span>by <span style="">law - </span><span style="">any </span><span style="">doubt should be interpreted in their favor."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finding for the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the trial court, therefore, rendered judgment as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered for the plaintiffs and
against the defendant, ordering the latter to pay plaintiff Benjamin Wenceslao,
Five Hundred Thirty (P530.00) Pesos, Manuel Eulano, One Thousand Three Hundred
Six Pesos (P1,306.00); Juanita Barcelon, Six hundred Eighty Three Pesos &amp;
Thirty Three Centavos (P683.33); Manuel <span class="SpellE">Echevarria</span>,

(P4,707.24) with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of the filing
of this complaint, until fully paid; plus the amount of P1,000.00 as attorney<span style="">'s</span> fees and the costs of this
suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is appellant's contention in this instance that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> should be deemed to have been dismissed for
cause, namely, the closing or cessation of its business, there being no showing
that the closing was for the purpose of defeating the intention of the law;
that, at any rate, having been immediately employed by Times Film Corporation, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> should be deemed to have abandoned their
employment with appellant, or, at least, to be no longer entitled to one
month's <span style="">notice prior to </span>the
termination of their services.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find both contentions
to be without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">True, appellant's film exchange business where <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> worked was closed as of February 28, 1962, but
what the law considers as just cause for terminating an <span style="">employment without a definite period is the closing or cessation of
operation of the <u>establishment</u> or <u>enterprise</u> </span>of the
employer, and not merely the closing or cessation of operation of any
particular division or department of the employer's business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain appellant's con­tention in this
regard would amount to reading this into <span style="">the
law - something which we are not ready to do, con­sidering its adverse effects
upon the rights of the employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it
must be so, let the law say it clearly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regarding the alleged
abandonment by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> of their employment with
appellant, suffice it to say that they did not apply for employment with the
Times Film Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">happened was that appellant, probably
inspired by a desire to give them immediate employment elsewhere, or by some </span>other
reason, worked things out so that, immediately after the closure of its own
film exchange business, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> would find work <span style="">elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, while laudable, does not seem to be in full satis­</span>faction
of the <span style="">purpose of the law requiring
advance </span>notice <span style="">to be served upon
</span>employees whose <span style="">services are to
be terminated, which is to give them sufficient time to look for another perhaps
better place of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
the present case, in the predicament, they found them­selves when appellant
notified then of the termination of <span style="">their
services, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had no reasonable alternative but
to accept the new employment which appellant had found for them; the other
alternative was the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection it must be further observed that while their employment was not
interrupted, their new employer re­</span>fused to tack in their years of
service under appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This
meant that as far as the new employer was concerned, they were starting from
scratch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, of course, was
prejudicial to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> because it <span style="">would in </span>due time affect their right
to bigger separation pay and other privileges.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the appealed decision to be in
