Corporation <span style="">vs.
</span>Julian R. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, Jr. and Supreme Sales &amp;
Development Corporation, of the amended complaint of July 16, 1965 of
plaintiff-appellant Filipinas Investment &amp; Finance Corporation whereby it
sought to recover from defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Supreme
Sales &amp; Development Corporation the de­ficiency that resulted after it had
foreclosed the chat­tel mortgage on and sold at public auction, the car of <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the other
defendant, Julian <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, Jr. who had failed to pay to
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> installments due on the promissory note
representing the purchase price of said car which he had bought from the same,
appellant being the assignee of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of its
rights in the said promissory note.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The
defendant, Julian R. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, Jr., executed and de­livered
to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> a promissory note in the amount of
P14,605.00 payable in monthly installments according to a schedule of payments;
the payment of the aforesaid amount which was the purchase price of a motor
vehicle, a 4-door Consul sedan, bought by said defendant from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, was secured by a chattel mortgage over such
automobile; on the same day, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> negotiated the
above-mentioned promis­sory note in favor of appellant Filipinas Investment
&amp; Finance Corporation, assigning thereto all its rights, title and
interests to the same, <u>the assignment including the right of recourse against
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span></u>; defendant <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>
defaulted in the payment of part of the installment which fell due on January
6, 1965, as well as the subsequent three consecutive monthly </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">installments </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">which he was sup­posed to have paid on
February 6, March 6 and April 6, 1965; there being a provision in the aforesaid
promissory note and chattel mortgage that failure to pay the install­ments due
would result in the entire obligation becoming due and demandable, appellant
demanded from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the payment of such
outstanding balance; in turn, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
"authorized (appellant) to take such action as may be ne­cessary to enable
(it) to take possession of the </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">x</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> motor
vehicle." Pursuant to such authority, appellant secured possession of the
mortgaged vehicle by means of </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">a </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> duly obtained from the
court, preparatory to the foreclosure of the mortgage, but said writ became
unnecessary because upon learning of the same, defendant <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>
voluntarily surrendered the car to appellant; there­after, the said car was
sold at public auction, but the proceeds still left a deficiency of P8,349.35,
plus in­terest of 12% per annum from April 21, 1965; and appellant, the above
foreclosure and sale notwithstanding, would hold <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
liable for the payment of such outstanding balance, plus attorney's fees and
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is undisputed in the instant case that the amount of

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Under the facts alleged in the amended
complaint which are deemed admitted by the motion to dismiss,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this assign­ment of error must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The specific allegations in the amended complaint which have
material bearing to the issue herein are:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
November 4, 1964, </span><u>defendant</u> <span style="">Supreme
Sales &amp; Development Corporation, with notice to defendant </span><u>Julian
R. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, Jr. negotiated in favor of (endorsed and
delivered to) plaintiff the above-men­tioned promissory note, Annex
"A", on a with-recourse basis whereby in case of the failure and/or
refusal of the maker thereof, defendant Julian R. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>,
Jr. to pay the obligation under the said promissory note, plaintiff shall have
the right of recourse against the said defendant corporation</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>On the same date, said defendant corporation</u>, <span style="">with notice to defendant<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Julian R. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>,
Jr.</u>, assigned to plaintiff its rights, title, and interests to the
aforesaid promissory note </span>and chattel mortgage, Annexes "A"
and "B" hereof, as shown by the Deed of Assignment executed by de­fendant
Supreme Sales &amp; Development Corporation in favor of plaintiffs, a copy of which
is hereto attached as Annex "C" and made an integral part hereof, <u>which
assignment is also subject to the right of re­course above-mentioned</u>;<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The defendant corporation is liable to
plaintiff for the en­tire balance of the obligation co­vered by the promissory
note, Annex "A", and secured by the chattel mort­gage, Annex
"B", as a general endor­ser of the promissory note, </u><u><span style="">Annex </span>"A", and assignor of
the chattel mortgage on a with-recourse basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But should plaintiff be able to sell the above-described motor vehicle,
then the said defendant corporation is liable to the plaintiff for the payment
of the bal­ance of the obligation after applying thereto the proceeds of the
sale of the said vehicle.</u>" (Record on Appeal, pp. 12 and 15.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus it can be seen that the assignment made by <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> to appellant of the promissory note and mortgage
of de­fendant <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> was on a with-recourse
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there was a
definite and clear agreement between appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
that should appellant fail to secure full re­covery from defendant <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, the right was reserved to appellant to seek recourse
for the deficiency against <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span>. Accordingly,
the question for resolution by the Court now is whether or not this provision
regarding recourse con­tained in the agreement between appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> violates the Recto Law which declares null and
void any agreement in contravention thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not believe that it does.</p>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out in appellant's brief, the transaction between
appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was purely an ordinary dis­counting
transaction whereby the promissory note executed by defendant <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> was negotiated by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
in favor of appellant for a valuable consideration at a certain discount,
accompanied by an assignment also of the chattel mortgage executed by said
defendant to secure the payment <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">of his promissory note and with the express
stipulation that should there be any deficiency, recourse could be had against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated
otherwise, the remedy pre­sently being sought is not against the buyer of the
car or the defendant <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> but against the seller,
independ­ent of whether or not such seller may have a right of re­covery
against the buyer, which, in this case, he does not have under the Recto
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear to Us, on the other hand,
that under said law, what Congress seeks to protect are only the buyers on
installment who more often than not have been victimized by sellers who, before
the enactment of this law, succeeded in unjustly enriching themselves at the
expense of the buyers because aside from recovering the goods sold, upon
default of the buyer in the payment of two installments, still retained for
themselves all amounts already paid, in addition, furthermore, to other
damages, such </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">as </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">attorney's fees,
and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, Con­gress could not
have intended to impair and much less do away with the right of the seller to
make commercial use of his credit against the buyer, provided said buyer is not
burdened beyond what this law allows.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not unmindful that in the case of Cruz, et al. vs. the
same Filipinas Investment &amp; Finance Corporation, L-24772, May 27, 1968, 23
SCRA 791, this Court broadened the scope of the Recto Law beyond its letter and
held that within its spirit, a seller of goods on installment does not have any
right of action against a third party who, in addition to the buyer's mortgage
of the goods sold, fur­nishes additional security for the payment of said
install­ments or the purchase price of said goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is here agreed that plaintiff Cruz failed to pay several
installments as provided in the contract; that there was extrajudicial
foreclosure of the chattel mortgage on the said motor ve­hicle; and that
defendant-appellant it­self bought it at the public auction duly held
thereafter, for a sum less than the purchaser's outstanding obli­gation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-appellant, however, sought to
collect the supposed deficiency by going against the real estate mortgage which
was admittedly constitu­ted on the land of plaintiff Reyes as additional
security to guarantee the performance of Cruz' obligation, claim­ing that what
is being withheld from <span style="">the vendor, by
the proviso of Article 1484 of the Civil Code, is only the right to recover
"against the purchaser", and not a recourse to the additional
security put up, not by the purchaser himself, but by a third person.</span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no merit in this con­tention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain appellant's argument is to
overlook the fact that if the guarantor should be compelled to pay the balance
of the purchase price, the guarantor will in turn be entitled to recover what
she has paid from the debtor vendee (Art. 2066, Civil Code); so that
ultimately, it will be the vendee who will be made to bear the payment of the
balance of the price, despite the earlier fore­closure of the chattel mortgage
given by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the protection given
<span style="">by Article 1484 would be indirectly
subverted, and public policy over-turned."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen, that case of Cruz was entirely dif­ferent from
this one at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, herein
appel­lant Filipinas Investment &amp; Finance Corporation was try­ing to
recover from the guarantor of the buyer, whereas <span style="">in the present case, it is precisely stipulated in effect, that the
Filipinas Investment &amp; Finance Corporation had a right of recourse against
the seller should the buyer fail to pay the assigned credit in full.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">It
is the contention of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that since what </span></span>were
assigned to appellant were only whatever rights it had against the buyer, it
should follow that inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> has no right
to recover from the defendant beyond the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, the
appellant, as assignee, should also have no right to recover any
deficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not view the matter
that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very fact that the as­signee
was given the stipulated right of recourse against the assignor negates the
idea that the parties contemplated to limit the recovery of the assignee to
only the proceeds of the mortgage sale.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order of dismissal of the lower court is
reversed and this case is ordered remanded to the lower court for further
proceedings, with costs against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Supreme
Sales &amp; Development Corporation.</p>

Evidence seems to have been presented by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and
admitted by the trial court in connection with the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is obvious that said evidence is
relevant, the same cannot be taken into account, since the motion to dismiss is
based on the ground that the amended complaint states no cause of action and,
therefore, all material facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed admitted
for purposes of said motion.</p>
