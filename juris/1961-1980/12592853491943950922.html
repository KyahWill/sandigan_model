				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 24, 1960, petitioners Salvador Aprueba and Asuncion Modoc
filed with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo a petition for
mandamus against respondent City Mayor of Iloilo City, alleging among
others, that they are owners and operators of a cafeteria located in
Stall 17-C of the city market since 1950 to October 1, 1960 when
respondent city mayor ordered his policemen to close it for alleged
violation of city ordinance as they did on same date despite their
protest; that when petitioner Aprueba saw respondent on October 3,
1960, he was informed by the latter that the store could only be
reopened if petitioners paid all their back accounts; that after paying
the back accounts, respondent still refused to allow reopening of the
store and instead chided him for working against respondent's candidacy
in the last elections; that respondent told petitioner Aprueba to
comply with health rules and regulations which he did; that respondent
told him later that the store space would be used as an extension
(bodega) of the city health office; that petitioners have no
delinquency in rentals and have complied with health rules and
regulations and it is the ministerial duty of respondent to allow them
to operate the cafeteria and refreshment parlor business; that in
refusing them to reopen their business, respondent unlawfully excluded
them from the use and enjoyment of a right they are entitled to, or
unlawfully neglected performance of an act which the law specifically
enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station; that
respondent's acts were motivated by personal and selfish considerations
and intended to persecute, harass, and ridicule his political enemies;
that petitioners as a result suffered moral damages and incurred
attorneys fees in the sum of P5,500.00. Petitioners prayed that a
preliminary mandatory injunction issue commanding respondent to order
the reopening of the cafeteria and allow petitioners to operate their
business, and pay P5,500.00 as damages and attorneys fees and P5.00
daily from October 1, 1960 until reopening of the cafeteria.
<p>To this complaint respondent filed an answer with counterclaim on
November 3, 1960 (later amended on July 25, 1962) denying the material
allegations of said complaint and alleging as defense that the remedy
of mandamus cannot be resorted to for the purpose of compelling him to
reopen the stall, as petitioners' privilege to remain therein rests on
an implied contract of lease and that obligations that rest solely on
contract cannot be enforced by mandamus where there is no question of
trust or official duty; that even if mandamus may be the proper remedy,
petitioners have no cause of action against respondent, because
petitioner Aprueba, who is lessee of stall 17-C, allowed his
co-petitioner Modoc to conduct business therein, in gross violation of
Ordinance No. 93, s. 1947 which prohibits a person other than the
lessee of a market stall from conducting business therein; that
petitioner Modoc has no legal capacity to sue respondent as she is
merely occupying a market stall leased to her co-petitioner Aprueba in
gross violation of Ordinance No. 93, s. 1947; that respondent's refusal
to allow the opening of the cafeteria was in accordance with Section
10(m) of the city charter. Respondent prayed that the petition be
dismissed and, on the counterclaim, judgment be rendered ordering
petitioners to pay respondent P5,500.00 as moral damages. On November
1, 1962, petitioners filed answer to the counterclaim.</p>
<p>On November 19, 1962, the trial court issued an order dismissing the petition, which in pertinent part, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"x x x this Court, finding the reasons of
respondent's counsel to be well taken, is of the opinion and so holds
that the remedy of mandamus applied for by the petitioner is not the
proper remedy, but if at all, the action must be an action for specific
performance based on a contractual obligation. The right to the
occupancy of stall No. 17-C of the Public Market of the City of Iloilo
by petitioner, is but a privilege which the respondent Mayor may or may
not grant, but not a duty enjoined upon him by law, by reason of his
position."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their motion for reconsideration of said order having been denied, petitioners brought to us the present appeal.</p>
<p>The only issue to be resolved in this appeal is whether or not the
Court of First Instance correctly dismissed the petitioners' petition
for mandamus. In refusing to grant mandamus, the trial court premised
its action on the fact that petitioners' occupancy of Stall 17-C in
question in Iloilo City market "is but a privilege which the respondent
mayor may or may not grant, but not a duty enjoined upon him by law, by
reason of his position". Note also that the refusal of respondent to
allow reopening of the cafeteria is predicated on the provision of
Section 10(m) of the City Charter which states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 10. <em>General duties and powers of the Mayor</em>.
- The mayor shall have immediate control over the executive functions
of the several departments of the City, and shall have the following
general duties and powers:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">x x x x x x</p>
  <p>"(m) To
grant and refuse municipal licenses and to revoke the same for
violation of the conditions upon which they were granted, or if acts
prohibited by law or municipal ordinance are being committed under the
protection of such licenses or in the premises in which the business
for which the same have been granted is carried out, or for any other
good reason of general interest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the privilege of petitioners to obtain a renewal of the
permit (after the implied lease contract expired) rested on the sound
discretion of respondent and refusal on his part to grant the
continuance of the privilege (especially after petitioner Aprueba's
alleged violation of city ordinance by allowing co-petitioner Modoc to
operate business in stall 17-C) cannot be the subject of an action for
mandamus. In a long line of decisions, this Court had held that
mandamus will not issue to control or review the exercise of discretion
of a public officer where the law imposes on him the right or duty to
exercise judgment in reference to any matter in which he is required to
act (Blanco v. Board 46 Phil. 192; Lee Wing v. Collector, 30 Phil. 363;
see II Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 170-171). And where the
legal rights of petitioners, as in the present case, are not
well-defined, clear, and certain, the petition for mandamus must be
dismissed (Viuda de Zamora v. Wright, 53 Phil. 613). The privilege of
operating a market stall under license is always subject to the police
power of the city government and may be refused or granted for reasons
of public policy and sound public administration. Such privilege is not
absolute but revocable under an implied lease contract subject to the
general welfare clause. Another rule is that a contractual obligation,
as the lease to petitioner Aprueba of the stall in question, is not a
duty specifically enjoined by law resulting from office, trust, or
station, and the rule universally accepted is that mandamus never lies
to enforce the performance of contractual obligations (City of Manila<span style="font-style: italic;">
vs</span>. Posadas, 40 Phil. 309; Florida &amp; Peninsular R. Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>State ex
rel. Tansvere, 20 LRA 419). As the trial court correctly observed,
petitionersâ€™ remedy is an action for specific performance, if proper,
based on a contractual obligation (Quiogue<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>. Romualdez, 46 Phil. 337;
Jacinto <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Director, 49 Phil. 853) and not mandamus.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no error in the order appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioners-appellants.</p>
<p><b>IT IS SO ORDERED.</b></p>
