the provisions contained in the carrier's <u>regular long form</u> bill of

the Luzon Brokerage Corporation, customs broker hired by the United States
Lines, filed in behalf of the latter a provisional claim against the Manila
Port Service for short-landed, short-delivered and/or landed in bad order cargo
ex-United States Lines' vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 30, 1962, the <span class="SpellE">aforedescribed</span>

through a vessel of its <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> agent, Columbian Rope
Company, and duly received in good order by the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Parts and Service, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Parts and Service, Inc. filed on
December 26, 1962 a formal claim with the United States Lines through the
latter's agent, Columbian Rope Company, for the value Crates Nos. 3139, 3148,
3648 and 3649 in the total sum of P2,010.37.</p>

3148, when it was discovered that these two crates had been <span class="SpellE">overlanded</span>
in Honolulu, but refused to pay for the value of Crates Nos. 3648 and 3649 for
the reason that these crates had been lost while in the custody of the Manila
Port Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two crates (Nos. 3139 and 3148) which were over?landed
in <st1:city><st1:place>Honolulu</st1:place></st1:city> and for which United

sum of P1<span class="GramE">,458.25</span>, were later recovered and returned to
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Parts and Service, Inc. and the latter refunded
United States Lines for the sum it paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of United States Lines' refusal to pay for the two crates
(Nos. 3648 and 3649)-which were lost while in the custody of the Manila Port
Service, <span class="SpellE">Ker</span> Company, agent of Phoenix Assurance Co.,
Ltd., in the Philip­pines, and insurer of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Farts
and <span class="GramE">Service<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inc</span>.,
paid to the latter the value of said crates in the sum of P552.12.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1963</st1:date>,
the United States Lines, through the Columbian Rope Company, by letter informed
the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Parts and Service, Inc. that it was filing
a claim for the undelivered crates with the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And true to its word, it filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1963</st1:date> a formal Claim with
the Manila Port Service for the value of Crates Nos. 3648 and 3649, but the
latter declined to honor the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 26, 1963, United States Lines, through Colum­bian Rope
Company, its <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> agent, informed the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Parts and Service, Inc., <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the Manila Port Service had not yet
settled its claim, and that the one-year period provided by law within which to
bring action against the Manila Port Service for the two crates (Nos. 3648 and
3649) would expire on July 28, 1963.</p>

wrote on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1963</st1:date> the
United States Lines expressing its appreciation to the latter for taking action
against the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
same letter it requested for an exten­sion of time to file suit against the
United States Lines (the prescriptive period for doing so being set to expire
on July 28, 1963), explaining that it could not file suit against any entity
(including the Manila Port Service) except the United States Lines with whom
its <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Parts and Service, Inc., was in contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">No reply having been received by <span class="GramE">It</span> from
the United States Lines, the Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1963</st1:date> filed a suit praying
that judgment be rendered against the former for the sum of P552.12, with
interest at the legal rate, plus attorneys fees and expenses of litigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1963</st1:date>,
the United States Lines filed its answer with counterclaim,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> while
Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. filed its answer to said counterclaim on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1964</st1:date>,
the parties submitted a Partial Stipulation of Facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1964</st1:date> ren­dered a decision dismissing

<p class="BODY">Thus this appeal, raising the sole issue of whether or not the lower
court erred in dismissing the complaint and in exonerating defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from liability for the value of the two
undelivered crates Nos. 3648 and 3649.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stated at the outset that a bill of lading operates
both as a receipt and as a contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is a re­ceipt for the goods shipped and a contract to transport and deliver the
same as therein stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
receipt, it recites the date and place of shipment, describes the goods as to
quantity, weight, dimensions, identification marks and condition, quality, and
value. As a contract, it names the contracting parties, which include the con­signee,
fixes the route, destination, and freight rate or charges, and stipulates the
rights and obligations assumed by the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, it is a statutory and decisio­nal rule of
law that a contract is the law between the contracting parties,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and where there is nothing in it which is contrary to law, <span class="GramE">morals,</span>
good customs, public policy, or public order, the validity of the contract must
be sustained.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted by both parties that the crates subject matter of
this action were lost while in the posses­sion and custody of the Manila Port
Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the long form of Bill of
Lading (Annex "B" and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "2")
pro­vides that "The carrier shall not be liable in any capa­city
whatsoever for any loss or damage to the goods while the goods are not in its
actual custody"<span class="GramE">,</span> <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
cannot be held responsible for the loss of said crates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as correctly observed by the lower court,
it is hardly fair to make <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> accountable for a
loss not due to its acts or omissions or over which it had no control.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellant's stand, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
did not undertake to carry and deliver safely the cargo to the consignee in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The short form Bill of
Lading (Annex "A" and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"1") states in no uncertain terms that the port of discharge of the
cargo is <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, but that the same
was to be transshipped beyond the port of discharge to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the terms of the long form Bill
of Lading (Annex "B" and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"2"), <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> res­ponsibility as a
common carrier ceased the moment the goods were unloaded in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>;
and In the matter of transship­ment, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> acted
merely as an agent of the shipper and consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary likewise to appellant's contention,
the cargo was not transshipped with the use of transporta­tion used or operated
by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that the vessel used for transshipment is owned and operated
by <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> agent, the Columbian Rope
Company, but there is no proof that said vessel is owned or operated by <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
vessels of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> agent are being erro­neously
presumed by appellant to be owned and operated by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that the provisions of the Bill of Lading
exculpating the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from liability for cargo
losses, do not apply where full cargo freight is paid up to and beyond the
point of stipulated discharge, and here defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
agreed to absorb all costs of forward­ing and transshipment - freight having
been prepaid up to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the receipt of full cargo freight up to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
cannot render inoperative, the provisions of the Bill of Lading relied upon by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> inasmuch as such a situation is not provided
therein as an exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, one
searches the Bills of Lading (short and long forms) in vain for such an
exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is for the
convenience of both parties that full freight up to <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City, had been prepaid, otherwise there would have been need to make further
arrangements regarding the transshipment of the cargo to <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the long form Bill of
Lading provides that, "The shipper and consignee shall be liable to this
carrier for and shall in­demnify it against all expense of forwarding and <span class="GramE">trans­shipping,</span> including any increase in or additional
freight or other charges whatsoever." (Annex "B" and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"2", par. 6, <span class="SpellE">subpar</span>.</span> 4)</p>

<p class="BODY">The filing of a claim by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
with the Manila Port Service for the value of the losses cannot be considered
an indication that it is answerable for cargo losses up to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it is a convin­cing proof
that said party was not remiss in its duties: as agent or the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
captioned its claim against the Manila Port Service as "SS 'Pioneer Moor' <span class="SpellE">Voy</span>. <span class="GramE">25 <span class="SpellE">Reb</span>.</span>
1067 New York/<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> via Manila B/L T-1 31 Package's
Truck Spare Parts Cons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Parts and Service", likewise, is no proof that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> knowingly assumed liability for cargo losses up to
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely showed that the goods would have to
be, as indeed they were, first unloaded in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and thereafter trans­shipped to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Through the short form Bill of Lading (Annex "A" and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. incorporating by reference the terms of the regular long
form bill of lading (Annex "B" and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"2"), the United States Lines acknowledged the receipt of the cargo
of truck spare parts that it carried, and stated the conditions under which it
was to carry the cargo, the place where it was to be transshipped, the entity
to which delivery is to be made, and the vote of compensation for the
carriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This it delivered to the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Parts and Services, Inc as evidence of a contract
between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By receiving the bill of
lading, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Parts and Services, Inc. assented to
the terms of the consignment contained therein, and became bound thereby, so
far as the conditions named are reasonable in the eyes of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since neither appellant nor <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> alleges that any provision therein is contrary to
law moral’s good customs, public policy, or public order, - and indeed We found
none - the validity of the Bill of Lading must be sustained and the provisions
therein properly applied to resolve the con­flict between the parties.</p>
