4, 1965, in the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, this
action for collection against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sabañgan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bontoc</span>,
Mountain Province, for the recovery of the principal sum of P1,115.00,
representing the charge invoice value of G.I. pipes of various sizes needed by

<p class="BODY">Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, through its mayor,
Agustin Velasco, timely filed its Answer to the Complaint, alleging that
according to its records, "the then Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Sabañgan</span>
wan never authorized to contract or buy on credit from the plaintiff, various
and different sizes of G.I. Pipes needed in the construction of its municipal
waterworks, hence, defendant municipality can not in any way, be legally bound

rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellants, as prayed for in their
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
interposed its appeal from said decision to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, but did not pay or deposit the Court of First
Instance docket fee nor file an appeal bond, as required by Rule 40, section 2
of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs-appellants, therefore, moved the Court <u>a quo</u> to
dismiss the appeal on the ground of non-perfection of the appeal, contending
that only the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

the Republic of the Philippines, is exempt from the filing of ouch fees in

The only issue of law raised by them in two related assignments of error in
their brief is "the correct interpretation of Section 16 of Rule 141 of
the new Rules of Court'; which provides that -</p>

<blockquote>"Section 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Government
Exempt</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

and in the payment of the legal fees provided for under the said Section 16 of
Rule 141 of the new Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the decision of the City Court in Civil Case No. 3114 was
not vacated because the appeal was not perfected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 9 of Rule 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the Court of First Instance

on its merit, and hence, the decision rendered by the said Court of First

no legal effect."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiffs' appeal must

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sustain
plaintiffs-appellants in their contention that the exemption clause in Rule
141, Sec. 16 of the new Rules of Court (formerly Rule 130) exempting the
Republic of the Philippines from paying the legal fees provided therein is
applicable only to the Republic of the Philippines; i.e. the National
Government, and not to local governments or subdivisions, as correctly ruled by
the late Secretary of Justice Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Section 2 of the Revised Administra­tive
Code specifically defines "National Government" as referring "to
the central government as distinguished from the different forms of local
government" and dif­ferentiates it from "specially organized
provinces", "regularly organized provinces",
"municipalities" and "chartered cities" which constitute
""the provincial or municipal branches or other form of local
government." That such exemption from the payment of legal fees is
available only to the State, the Republic <u>per</u> <u>se</u>, is evident from
the similar construction of long usage to the analogous provision of Rule 142,
Section 1 of the Rules of Court that "no costs shall be allowed against
the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
unless otherwise pro­vided by law." As early as 1920, it has been held by
this Court in <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> vs. The City of Manila and
Trinidad<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>,
that while no costs shall be allowed against the Government of the Philippines
where it is the unsuccessful party, the general rule that costs are imposed
upon the unsuccessful party ap­plies to public corporations which sue and can
be sued and municipal corporations.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, however, did not commit </span>a
fatal error of jurisdiction in erroneously holding that the <st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype></st1:place> was exempt from pay­ment
of the appellate court docket fee provided in Rule 40, Section 2, and taking
cognizance of its ap­peal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far <span style="">as </span>the writer's research shows, this <span style="">is </span>the first time that the question of
the applica­bility to local governments of the exemption from legal fees under
Rule 141, Section 16, has been squarely put in issue in a case before this
Court, although this Court has invariably required local governments to pay
such docket fees in cases brought <span style="">on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>parties-litigants <span style="">were </span><span style="">properly be</span>fore the Court <u><span style="">a </span></u><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">, </span>which duly heard them in a trial <u>de</u>
<u>novo</u> and rendered judgment accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs-appellants' contention that <span style="">non-payment </span>by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of
the legal fees and non?posting of the appeal bond renders null and void
the Court <u>a quo's</u><span style=""> </span>decision
- when the said Court, in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction had held de<span style="">fendant municipality to be exempt from </span>such
require­<span style="">ments - </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">legally untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court,
speaking </span>through Justice J. B. L. Reyes, in National Waterworks <span style="">&amp; Sewerage Authority vs. Sec. of Public
Works &amp; Com­munication, G.R. No. L-20928, March 31, 1966, has already ruled
</span>out such a <span style="">contention, </span>holding
that in appealed cases, <span style="">failure to pay
the docketing fees does not automati­</span>cally result in the dismissal of
the appeal, much less <span style="">affect the
Court's </span>jurisdiction, <span style="">the </span>dismissal
being discretionary in the <span style="">appellate
court, and </span>that this <span style="">rule is
applicable by analogy to Courts of First In­</span>stance in the exercise of
the appellate jurisdiction conferred upon them.</p>

<blockquote>"In its first assignment of error, the defendant Secretary
contends that, admitting that the <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span> complaint
in <span style="">appeal was sent by registered mail
on the last of </span>the 30 days allowed by the Irrigation Act for appealing
the adminis­trative decision to the <span style="">court
of competent </span>jurisdiction, still the complaint, may not <span style="">be deemed to have been filed on the same </span>day,
for the reason that there <span style="">is </span>no
showing that the filing fees were simultaneous­ly paid."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appellant's argument, how­ever, <span style="">fails </span>to take into account that, <u>in appealed cases, failure
to pay the </u><u><span style="">docketing fees does
not automatically </span>result in the dismissal of the appeal; the dismissal
is discretionary in the </u><u><span style="">appellate
</span>court</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule 141, Section 3,
speaking of the fees of the clerk of the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court,
provides that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'If the fees are not paid, the court may refuse to proceed with the
action until they are paid and may dismiss the appeal or the action or
proceeding.'</p>

<blockquote>"The rule quoted is applicable by analogy to the Court of
First Instance of Manila in the instant case, since the Court was exercising
appellate jurisdiction conferred upon it by law to review adminis­trative
decisions under the Irrigation Act." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘<span class="SpellE">xxxx</span> the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
can not be applied <span style="">as against a munici­pal
</span>corporation to validate a contract which it has no power to make, or
which it is authorized to make only under prescribed conditions, within
prescribed limitations, or in a prescribed mode or manner, although the
corporation has accepted the benefits thereof and the other party has fully
performed his part of the agreement, or has expended large sums in preparation
for performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reason frequently
assigned for this rule, is that to apply the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
against a municipality in such case would be to enable it to do indirectly what
it cannot do directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, where a
contract is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of public policy, the
municipality executing it cannot be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to
assert the invalidity on the ground; nor can it be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
to assert the invali­dity of a contract which has ceded away, controlled or
embarrassed its legislative or governmental powers.' (38 Am. Jr. pp. 202-204)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In connection with public biddings which was not complied
with the same deci­sion of the Supreme Court stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"'pub­lic biddings are held for the best
protec­tion of the public and to give the public the best possible advantages
by means of open competition between the bidders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, contracts requiring public bidding
affect public interest, and to change them without complying with that
requirement would in­deed be against public policy.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One more significant point in con­nection with the
acquisition of the as­sorted pipes is revealed in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"C", a portion of which is also marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"2", for the municipality. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
letter in­dicates that the payment would come from the release to be made by
former President Garcia which, unfortunately, was frozen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also indicates that instructions were
given not to install the pipes until all questions were settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the pipes had already been
installed they were ordered dismantled to be piled and to be returned to the
owner if the <span class="SpellE">frozenning</span> (sic) order was not
lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, clear that the
mayor, aside from want of authority to execute the contract, had not intended
to bind the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sabañgan</span> to pay for the
indebtedness for the payment would not come from the funds of the municipality
but from the release of funds by former Presi­dent Garcia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff took the risk of deliver­ing the pipes not knowing
definitely from whom the payment would be drawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He indi­cated in the invoice that the
