				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The issue posed in this appeal is whether domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies are entitled to return only 25 per cent of their income from dividends under the 1957 amendment of section 24 of the National Internal Revenue Code, the pertinent provisions of which read as follows:<p></p><blockquote><p>"SEC. 24. <em>Rate of Tax on Corporation.</em> — (A) In general there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the total net income received in the preceding taxable year from all sources by every corporation organized in, or existing under the laws of the Philippines, no matter how created or organized, but not including duly registered general copartnership (<em><em>compañias colectivas</em></em>). domestic insurance companies and foreign life insurance companies doing business in the Philippines, a tax upon such income equal to the sum of the following:</p><p>"Twenty <em><em>per centum</em></em> upon the amount by which such total net income does not exceed one hundred thousand pesos; and&nbsp; </p><p>"Twenty-eight <em><em>per centum</em></em> upon the amount by which such total net income exceeds one hundred thousand pesos; and a like tax shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid annually upon the total net income received in the preceding taxable year from all sources within the Philippines by every corporation organized, authorized or existing under the laws of any foreign country: . . . <em>And <em>Provided, further</em>,</em> That in the case of dividends received by a domestic or resident foreign corporation from a domestic corporation liable to tax under this Chapter or from a domestic corporation engaged in a new and necessary industry, as defined under Republic Act Numbered Nine hundred and one, only twenty-five <em>per centum</em> thereof shall be returnable for purposes of the tax imposed by this section.&nbsp; </p><p>"(B) <em>Rate of Tax on Life Insurance Companies</em>.— There shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid annually from every insurance company organized in or existing under the laws of the Philippines, or foreign life insurance company authorized to carry on business in the Philippines, but not including purely cooperative companies or associations as defined in section two hundred and fifty-five of this Code, on the total investment income received by such company during the preceding taxable year from interest, dividends and rents from all sources whether from or within the Philippines, a tax of six and one-half <em><em>per centum</em></em> upon such income: <em><em>Provided, however</em>,</em> That foreign life insurance companies not doing business in the Philippines shall, on any investment income received by them from the Philippines, be subject to tax as any other foreign corporation. . . ."</p></blockquote><p>The Court of Tax Appeals ruled that life insurance companies should report in full their income from dividends because, while they are treated in subsection (B), the proviso regarding dividend exclusion is found in subsection (A) which treats of corporations in general. The petitioner appealed to this Court, contending, on the basis of the history of the proviso, that the benefits of dividend exclusion are available to all domestic and resident foreign corporations regardless of the business in which they may be engaged.</p><p>We agree with the petitioner.</p><p>The petitioner is a domestic life insurance company. </p><p>On March 1.8, 1959, it filed an income tax return for 1958 showing the following data:&nbsp;

It however denied the claim of the petitioner for refund on the ground that the proviso allowing the return of only 25 per cent of the income from dividends is found in subsection (A) of section 24 of the National Internal Revenue Code, while life insurance companies are dealt with in another subsection, although of the same section, The Tax Court's <em>ratio decidendi</em> reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"As a general rule of statutory construction a proviso is deemed to apply only to the immediately preceding clause or provision. Where, as in the case at bar, there is no clear legislative intention to apply it to the subseclause or provision (Section 24 [B] we are constrained to interpret the proviso as affecting only the preceding clause or provision, (See Collector, et al. <i>vs.</i> Servando de los Angeles, et al., 101 Phil., 1026), Consequently, we are of the opinion that the proviso relative to the returnability of only 25% of such dividends applies only to corporations organized in or existing under the laws of the Philippines . . . but not including duly registered copartnerships (<em>compañias colectivas</em>), domestic life insurance companies and foreign life insurance companies doing business in the Philippines."</p></blockquote><p>But a purely syntactical approach is hardly a safe guide to the meaning of a statute. The position of a proviso, for instance, although possessed of considerable influence, is not necessarily controlling. The proviso may apply to sections or portions thereof which follow it or even to the entire statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Position, after all, cannot override intention, in the ascertainment of which the legislative history of a statute is extremely more important.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p>A resort to legislative history should prove particularly helpful in the case of section 24 of the Code as this section has gone through a miscellany of amendments, with the result that its basic outlines are now only vaguely discernible, From a one-paragraph section it has grown into a multi-paragraph one, with lengthy sentences qualified at every turn by exceptions and provisos, The readability expert<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> who once complained of a provision of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as a "nightmare" of a writing, would be at a loss for words to describe section 24 of our Code.</p><p>The following table shows the changes which section 24 has undergone at each of the eight different stages of its amendment,</p><p align="center">CORPORATE INCOME TAX: A COMPARATIVE TABLE OF AMENDMENTS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp;

It is a device for reducing extra or double taxation of distributed earnings. Since a corporation cannot deduct from its gross income the amount of dividends distributed to its corporation-shareholders during the taxable year, any distributed earnings are necessarily taxed twice: initially at the corporate level when they are included in the corporation's taxable income, and again, at the corporation-shareholder level when they are received as dividend. Thus, without exclusion the successive taxation of the dividend as it passes from corporation to corporation would result in repeated taxation of the same income and would leave very little for the ultimate individual shareholder. At the same time the decision to tax a part (e.g., 25 per cent) of such dividends reflects the policy of discouraging complicated corporate structures as well as corporate divisions in the form of parent-subsidiary arrangements adopted to achieve a lower effective corporate income tax rate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p>Until 1957 there had been no question that the proviso on dividend exclusion applied to all domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies. The question arose when, by virtue of Republic Act 1855 (1957), the original provisions of section 24, with slight modifications, were made sub-section (A), while a new sub-section (B), entitled "Rate of Tax on Life Insurance Companies," was added. The result is that the proviso on dividend exclusion now appears to qualify only a part of section 24, making it doubtful whether after 1957 the income from dividends of domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies still enjoys exemption, although, as noted in passing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the proviso continues to speak of "the tax imposed by this section" (not sub-section).</p><p>However, a review of the circumstances which prompted the amendment of section 24 in 1957 shows no intention to withdraw from life insurance companies the exemption which theretofore had been enjoyed by them along with non-life insurance companies. To be sure, the 1957 amendment was intended for a two-fold purpose: first, to change the tax base from premium income to investment income, and, second, to lower the tax on life insurance companies, in order to encourage their growth as well as their investment in the development of the national economy.</p><p>Prior to 1957, life insurance companies were required, for income tax purposes, to include premium receipts in gross income. It became generally recognized, however, that the inclusion of premium receipts in the gross taxable income of life insurance companies was unsound because premium receipts do not constitute income in the sense of gain or profit. They are really savings deposits of the individual policyholders, a large portion of which goes directly to reserve funds required by law for the payment of their claims for death benefits, cash surrender values and maturity values. Therefore, to tax an insurance company on account of these "deposits" or "savings" is actually to tax the policyholder for being provident. What constitutes true income for a life insurance company is rather its investment income from interest, dividends and rents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p>Besides, the premiums which a life insurance company receives are already subject to a tax of 3 per cent under section 255 of the Code. To require their inclusion in gross income for purposes of section 24 is to subject them to double taxation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p>The rate of tax was lowered in recognition of the fact that a life insurance company derives profit from its investment income only to the extent that such income exceeds the rate of interest at which the reserve must be maintained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p>In sum, as the then Congressman Ferdinand Marcos described the bill which became Republic Act 1855, "It is a bill which places [life] insurance companies in the same class as other companies. And the rate is lower than in ordinary companies because it is six and one half per cent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p>If the purpose of the 1957 amendment was to place life insurance companies at par with other companies by taxing them on their true income, then the legislature could not have intended to withdraw from them a privilege which they had then been enjoying in common with non-life insurance companies. Indeed, by no rule of logic can the decision to exclude premium receipts from gross income be considered a decision to include all of dividend income in gross income.</p><p>Nor could it have been the intention of the legislature to discriminate against domestic life insurance companies in favor of resident foreign corporations engaged in other business. And yet this is just the implication of the interpretation urged on us by the respondents. For, indeed, to require life insurance companies to report in full their income from dividends would be not only to treat them differently from other companies, contrary to the first aim of the amendment, but also to impose on them a tax burden heavier than that imposed on resident foreign companies not engaged in life insurance. Thus, following the interpretation of the respondents, a resident foreign corporation with an income of P100,000 from dividends would be required to return only 25 per cent of it, or P25,000, the tax on which would be P5,000 (20% under Republic Act 1855). In contrast, a domestic life insurance company, required to report all its income from dividends, would have to pay a tax of P6,500 (6-½), or P1,500 more, despite the fact that the rate of tax on it is much lower. lt seems rather clear that these discriminatory and lop-sided results could not have been intended by Congress.</p><p>That Congress intended to accord preferential tax treatment to domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies is abundantly clear not only from the history of the 1957 amendment but also from the Comparative Table (<em><em>supra</em></em>) which shows that while the rate of tax on corporations in general has been raised, that on domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies has remained at 6-½ per cent — the lowest among those imposed on various types of corporations.</p><p>The truth is that section 24 has undergone amendments through a process which, in Cardozo's phrase,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> is no more intellectual than the use of paste pot and scissors. Consequently, reliance cannot be placed on its grammatical construction in order to arrive at its meaning. As the Comparative Table shows, after the amendment of section 24 in 1957, sub-section (A) thereof did not have a title, compared to sub-section (B), entitled "Rate of Tax on Life Insurance Companies" which was added. It took another amendment in 1959 to correct the deficiency, only to commit another error. Thus while the word "assessed" was deleted from sub-section (a) in consequence of the adoption of the "pay-as-you-file" system, the same word has remained in sub-section (c) even to this date. Again, within the same year, 1963, section 24 was amended twice but in the process more errors were committed. For while Republic Act 3841 was passed ostensibly to add certain words overlooked in the amendment of the section by Republic Act 3825, the proviso on reinsurance Premium (which was the reason for the enactment of Republic Act 3825) was inadvertently omitted in the text of section 24 (b)(1).</p><p>The reference to domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies in the excepting clause of sub-section (a) is even more awkward because the exception relates to the coverage of the entire section 24 and not simply to a subsection thereof. Thus, registered general copartnerships are excepted from the coverage of section 24 because they are not subject to tax as an entity. By express provision of section 26 of the Code persons doing business as a general copartnership duly registered in the mercantile registry are subject to income tax "only in their individual capacity." On the other hand, by including domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies in the excepting clause it was never the intention to exempt them from the payment of corporate income tax, which is the subject of section 24 as a whole. Furthermore, the exclusion of registered general copartnerships from the coverage of section 24 is justified because by statutory definition they are not anyway considered "corporations." On the other hand, life insurance companies are deemed "corporations" for purposes of the Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p>Thus, the haphazard amendment of section 24 by several legislative acts - as a result of which the proviso on dividend exclusion is now found in sub-section (a) — makes reliance on its grammatical construction highly unsafe and unsound in arriving at its meaning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Since nothing in the history of the 1957 amendment or in the rationale of dividend exclusion indicates the contrary, we hold that domestic and resident foreign life insurance companies are entitled to the benefits of dividend exclusion, the position of the proviso allowing it notwithstanding.</p><p>Accordingly, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue is ordered to refund to the petitioner company the amount of P2,721 as excess income tax for 1958.
