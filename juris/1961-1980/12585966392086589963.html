<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal by way of 
certiorari from the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations, penned by the 
Hon. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> M. Villanueva, in its Case No. 18-ULP, 
as well as from the denial of petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The factual background of this 
case is not disputed. The petitioner was engaged in tobacco <span class="SpellE">redrying</span>, with its <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant 
situated in <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>, La Union. Before it started 
operation it purchased lands in the vicinity, some at P0.20 a square meter and 
the rest at P0.80. Operations began on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="4" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 4, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
ceased in 1960. The work of its employees and laborers, however, was seasonal. 
The first season which started on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="4" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 4, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
terminated on August 31 of the same year. On August 1, in anticipation of the 
cessation of the plant's operation for that season, the petitioner's employees 
and laborers were served termination papers to take effect on August 31. There 
was then no definite policy concerning the procurement of personnel, although 
landowners who had sold their lands to the petitioner at P0.20 a square meter 
were given the privilege to have their <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> 
work in the plant, while the same privilege was extended to only a few of those 
who had sold at P0.80 a square meter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The following year's operation of 
the plant started in March 1957. In February the central office of the 
petitioner in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> issued a memorandum order 
concerning the procurement of personnel. The policy laid down in that memorandum 
was to give priority to those recommended by the landowners who had sold their 
lands to the petitioner at P0.20 a square meter, then to those recommended by 
the FACOMAS (Farmers Cooperative Marketing Associations), and finally to workers 
from any source or those recommended by government officials. The validity of 
that policy has not been questioned in this case and in fact has been upheld by 
the lower court in its decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appears that in June and July 
1956 the respondent union campaigned for membership among the laborers in the 
petitioner's <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant. On </span><st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 26, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
union officers informed the petitioner that said union had been organized and 
then presented a set of demands on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September <span class="GramE">23, 1956</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the plant operations started 
for the 1957 season a number of union members, among other laborers, who had 
worked in 1956 were not rehired, namely: Aurora Padilla, Victor <span class="SpellE">Refuerzo</span>, Isidro Rivera, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Dalaza</span>, Juan de Vera, Jose Padilla, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alaot</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Cabilitasan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabalot</span>, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Fronda</span>, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Ordonia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Dalaza</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Difuntorum</span>, Ricardo 
Alban, Marcela Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Domondon</span>. As a result of 
the petitioner's failure to reemploy them the union charged it with unfair labor 
practice, alleging discrimination by reason of their union membership. In 
addition, a special case was made out in connection with <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Padilla, who worked as mechanic at P4.00 a day 
since April 1956 but was dismissed in July of the same year on charges of having 
stolen company properties. He was subsequently cleared of the charges, but was 
not rehired for the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season of 
1957.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the charge of discrimination 
the lower court set forth the following considerations in its decision: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The CCE and its management 
denied having committed unfair labor practice against the members of complainant 
union, because all the workers were given termination papers on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="31" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 31, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
claim of the CCE and its management would have been valid if complainant union 
did not send a communication to management on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
26, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
informing the same of the formation of complainant union. That was before the 
termination of the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season of the year 1956. 
Said communication served as a notice to management that effective 
</span><st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 26, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a 
labor dispute has already commenced between complainant union and management. On 
</span><st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 23, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when complainant union sent the letter of demands to management, that became the 
core of the dispute between the former and the latter. The contention of 
management that on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 23, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
there were no laborers working in the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant 
of the CCE is naive, considering that the members of complainant union did not 
become members during the off-season, but during the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season of 1956. After knowing the officers and 
members of complainant union through the latter's communication of 
</span><st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 26, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
a copy of its roster sent to the company, management refused to accept the 
workers who were members of complainant union during the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season of 1957. To the mind of the Court, such act 
was plain discrimination against the members of complainant union because of 
their union-affiliation. Management, however, is not to blame for not accepting 
union members who were found not fit to work by the physician of the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant of the CCE in 1956, 1957 and 1958. But, as 
regards the union members who worked in 1956 and who were not found unfit for 
work, management was guilty of discrimination in refusing to readmit them the 
following <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season because of their 
union-affiliation. No evidence having been adduced by complainant that all the 
persons listed in Exhibit "I" were <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> of 
landowners and were members of complainant union and were refused work in any 
<span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season, not all of said persons were victims 
of discrimination by management. It should be noted that <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> of landowners, who were not members of 
complainant union, even if they were refused work by management, do not fall 
within the jurisdiction of this Court. Likewise, members of complainant union, 
who were not <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> of landowners, even if they 
were refused work during any <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season, are not 
victims of discrimination. Therefore, only <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> of landowners, who were members of complainant 
union and were refused work during any <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> 
season, not because they were not fit to work, are the victims of 
discrimination."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With particular reference to 
<span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Padilla the court held that his dismissal 
was motivated by his union activities. Upon these considerations the lower court 
rendered its judgment ordering the petitioner to pay him back wages from the 
date of dismissal up to the 1959 <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season, 
without reinstatement, and to pay the other laborers <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> their back wages from the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season "that they were refused work until the 1959 
<span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season, also without 
reinstatement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue of discrimination, as 
held by the lower court, hinges on three factors: (1) that the laborers 
concerned were members of the respondent union; (2) that they were <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> of landowners; and (3) that the failure of the 
petitioner to reemploy them in 1957 was due to their union 
membership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The first factor is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>. The truth of the second and the third, 
however, is assailed by the petitioner on the ground that there is no evidence 
whatsoever to support them. A corollary element should be considered, which is 
that all workers and employees of the petitioner, except a skeleton force, were 
served termination papers on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 1, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to 
take effect </span><st1:date year="1956" day="31" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 31, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
since that was the end of the 1956 re-drying season. There is no suggestion that 
the action thus taken constituted unfair labor practice; it was done in the 
ordinary course of business. The rehiring for the 1957 season was therefore in 
the nature of new employment, as to which the petitioner laid down a system of 
priorities. This was embodied in a memorandum (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2) 
which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"1. Legitimate landowners who 
sold their lands to the CCE at F0.20 a square meter shall be first priority in 
the employment of their immediate descendants and ascendants, or the brothers 
and sisters of his wife or husband, provided a total number for each landowner 
shall not exceed three. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In the event a landowner who 
sold their land at P0.20 a square meter has no relative within the degree above 
stated, he can recommend two aside from 
himself."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record does not show, and 
indeed the decision itself under review does not state, that the laborers who 
were adjudged entitled to back wages were <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> 
of landowners who had sold their lands to the petitioner at P0.20 and therefore 
had the priority prescribed for reemployment. All that the lower court found was 
that they had been recommended by landowners. Even this finding is not supported 
by substantial evidence in the record; and much less is there evidence that 
those laborers were <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> of landowners who had 
sold their lands to the petitioner at P0.20 a square meter. The burden of proof 
in this regard was upon the respondent union if it was to make out a case of 
discrimination and unfair labor practice. It may be gathered from the decision 
under review that there were other laborers during the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season of 1956 not affiliated to the respondent 
union who were similarly not hired for the season of 1957. If that was so, it is 
difficult to understand how discrimination can be inferred in respect to those 
who belonged to the union on the ground of their union membership. There are no 
circumstances cited by the lower court or by the respondent in its answer to the 
petition which would reveal in what particular manner the union members had been 
discriminated against. There are no figures as to how many persons had been 
recommended for reemployment, who recommended each of them, how many in each 
class of <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> were accepted and how many were 
rejected, and reason for their rejection. It is not enough to show that certain 
laborers were members of the union and that they were not hired for the season 
of 1957 in order that a conclusion of unfair labor practice may be 
justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Going back to the case of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Padilla, he was dismissed in July 1956 because he 
was charged with having stolen company properties. He was subsequently cleared, 
although according to the petitioner the charge was dismissed when it was found 
that the properties stolen belonged to the ACCFA and not to the petitioner. But 
this point is neither here nor there. For the question is whether or not the 
petitioner's failure to rehire him in 1957 was due to his union activities. 
Padilla testified that he had been recommended to the petitioner by his parents 
who had sold land to the petitioner at P0.20 a square meter, and on that basis 
the lower court declared that he was entitled to priority for the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season of 1957. The court committed an error here 
in giving credence to Padilla's testimony over the recitals in the deed of sale 
itself (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1), wherein it appears that the purchase 
price of the land was P0.80 a square meter. If he was not given preference in 
the procurement of laborers for the petitioner's <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season in 1957, it was pursuant to the policy laid 
down by the petitioner, his union activities being merely 
coincidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In any event, at the start of the 
<span class="SpellE">redrying</span> season of 1957 the petitioner had no contract 
with the respondent union concerning the hiring of laborers. The recruitment of 
new personnel had nothing to do with the season of 1956, at the end of which 
those who worked during that season were duly separated. The petitioner was free 
to establish a system of priorities for that purpose, and we do not see how its 
adherence to that system could constitute unfair labor practice against those 
who were not hired so as to entitle them to back wages not only for 1957 but 
even up to 1959.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The judgment appealed from is 
therefore reversed and set aside, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
