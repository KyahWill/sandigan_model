prayer for the issuance of a restraining order by peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus
Company, "the holder of several certificates of public convenience for the
operation of bus service" in several southern Luzon provinces extending to
Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is to compel respondent Land Transportation Com­mission to act on its letters
of January 24, February 2 and February 8, 1968,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein it sought deferment of action on any request of respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company, Inc. for the issuance of plates
covering units involved in its lease agreement with petitioner, such request
being premised on the alleged nullity of an order of respondent Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span> of the Public Service Commission, dated November 2,
1967, granting the petition of respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
Bus Company Inc. to "be allowed to acquire and register units for the
operation of the certificates on the ground that its contract of lease of its
certificates with the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company will terminate on March 6, 1968, * *
*" with the proviso "that it should not operate the same earlier than
March 6, 1968, which is the expiration date of the contract of
lease."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also expressly set
forth in this order of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span> that it
"is without prejudice to the resolution of applicant's contention that
under the lease contract it has the right to terminate the lease contract after
a 60-day period notice to the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Co., Inc. which is now pending before the
regular courts."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that this order of November 2, 1967 is beyond
the jurisdiction of the respondent Public Service Commission, acting through
respondent Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span>, on the ground that
the matter therein involved is pending resolution in an arbitration proceeding
by virtue of a decision of this Court on August 31, 1966, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which declared that the Public
Service Commission was without jurisdiction to continue with cases between then
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
Bus Company and then respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus
Company, Inc. "until final judgment or order is <span style="">rendered </span>by the Court of First Instance of Laguna in Civil Case
No. SP-600, and, until such time, the restraining order herein issued shall
remain effective.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
By virtue of the above decision of this Court, the parties were heard by the
Court of First Instance of Laguna in San Pablo City in the above civil case
with a partial decision being thereafter rendered as a result of which the
matter before it is now pending resolution by a Board of Arbitrators composed
of Atty. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner further predicates the alleged nullity of the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1967</st1:date> on the allegation
that in its issuance, pro­cedural due process was not observed, no hearing
having been accorded petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Co.,
Inc. immediately signified its intention to file a motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1968</st1:date>, this Court required petitioner to
serve immediately upon the aforesaid respondent a copy of its petition for
mandamus and contempt with a prayer for the issuance of a restraining order and
to give the aforesaid respondent up to <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="3">March
 4, 1968</st1:date> within which it could file its motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for restraining order as well as
the motion to dismiss were both set for hearing on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 2, 1968, an amended petition for mandamus, contempt,
certiorari, prohibition and injunction with a prayer for the issuance of a
restraining order was filed by petitioner to the end "that complete relief
may be obtained in only one pro­ceeding; * * *."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged that respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company Inc. in cooperation with the Land
Transportation Commission "has surreptitiously caused the registration of
the units for use in the disputed lines, * * *"; that the delay in
deciding its petition to vacate the <span style="">order
</span>of November 2, 1967 "is part of the scheme of [such] respondent
under which the order of denial would be issued at the last minute to give peti­tioner
no chance to take seasonable action thereon * * *"; that respondent
Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span> "has personally in­tervened
in causing the assignment" of the cases then pending in the Public Service
Commission to its prejudice, all of which, to justify its amended petition for
certiorari was characterized by petitioner as showing that such respondent
Associate Com­missioner did act in an improper, capricious and arbitrary
manner, thus requiring the intervention of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would lend a color of plausibility
to its plea for a writ of pro­hibition on the allegation that the actuations of
respondent officials before this Court "have become, or are without, or in
excess of their jurisdiction or with grave abuse of <span style="">discretion."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss, dated <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1968</st1:date> and docketed the <span style="">same </span>day, of respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
Bus Co., Inc., stated that petitioner "came to this [Court] with unclean
hands" and that its petition "does not state a cause of action."
After reciting the facts, respondent's motion to dismiss alleged "that the
pre­sentation of the petitioner's case in the instant petition leaves much to
be desired in <span class="SpellE">oompleteness</span> and accuracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was a <span style="">graver fault is its deliberate concealment and omission of material </span>facts
indispensable to a fair and accurate resolution" of this controversy.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the specifications of what it referred to as the incomplete and
grossly misleading presentation of the facts by the petitioner, referring to
the failure of petitioner to include mention of the lease contract between it
and respondent in 1958 as well as its renewal in 1963, the source of the
continuing dispute between the parties, to the non-disclosure of the issue
involved in it as well as the circumstances surrounding the issuance by this
Court of its restraining order in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company v. Public Service Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and its omission of a full hearing of the dispute having been conducted on
January 24, 1968, with reference to the matter which is embraced in the order
of November 2, 1967, there being a pre­vious petition to set aside and to
reconsider the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to
dismiss specified likewise why there was no cause of action in the original
petition which included a plea for certiorari and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties were duly heard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plea for a restraining order and the motion to dismiss were argued
on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No restrain­ing order was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No purpose would have been served as the
petition should have been dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Public Service Commission, acting thru respondent Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span>, has jurisdiction there being no substance to the
allegation that there was a denial of the right of petitioner to procedural due
process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner invokes the aforecited <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Company decision of this Honorable
Court to assail the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is here a misinterpretation, whether
thru inadvertence or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
opinion of this Court, speaking thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>,
was careful to point out, the Public Service Commission in that case was
restrained from acting "upon the application in question and resolve the
dispute of the parties as to the terms of the lease agreement," as to do
so "would amount to exercising the functions of a purely judicial
tribunal, an act it cannot do." More specifically, the opinion, in the
interest of clarity, limited the scope of the holding to "the private
aspect of the lease agreement, the private rights of the parties in their
relation to each other as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and lessee."
Relying on an earlier decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
it reaffirmed the doctrine that the "Public Service Commission has no
private control over a public utility in its private aspect * * *." There
was a clear intimation that where the matter would "involve the public
interest or public aspect" it is the Public Service Commission that has
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">That prop failing, no question should exist as to the
jurisdiction of the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was
implicit in the above <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company opinion, the earlier ruling in Garcia
v. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
has not lost its force or cogency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
in that case what was before this Court was the question of whether or not a
Court of First Instance has competence over a complaint for the recovery of
damages and the conveyance of a certificate of public con­venience, questions
which according to the opinion could not be inquired into, such issues being
for the Public Service Commission to resolve, it was the considered view of
this Court that over the res­pective rights of the parties insofar as the
operation of a public utility is concerned, the "Commission is the only
entity empowered to with­draw the certificate from [a claimant] and to transfer
it to [another] or grant him a new certificate." Similarly, what is
involved in this litigation, namely, a "petition to acquire and register
the units or trucks required to operate the lines of respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company Inc." after it had decided not to
renew or extend its Lease contract with petitioner, is properly cognizable by
the Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea
of lack of jurisdiction is therefore unavailing.</p>

<p class="BODY">That should suffice to dispose of this petition, were it not for
the additional allegation that in the issuance of the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1967</st1:date>, there was no
hearing accorded petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
allegation <span style="">is </span>without basis as
set forth in the motion to dismiss.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner "did not disclose that the respondent Public <span style="">Service Commission, </span>through Associate
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Josue</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span>,
conducted a full hearing on the dispute under Public Service Commission Case
No. 67-7081 on <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1968</st1:date>."
What was not disclosed was specifi­cally set forth in the motion to dismiss
thus: "On the very next day after the petitioner filed its Petition to Set
Aside And To Reconsider or on November 17, 1967, the respondent Commission
issued a Notice of Hearing <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> * * * setting the
same for Friday, November 24, 1967 at 9 a. m.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the respondent Commission, on the peti­tioner's own request,
held <span style="">a </span>session
<u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="12"><span style="">December </span>7, 1967</st1:date>, again to
consider the said Petition To Set Aside And To Reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respective lawyers of [petitioner] and
[respondent Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Co.], Domingo de Lara
and Manuel O. Chan, actually <span style="">argued </span>extensively
during this meeting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of the respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, and as was agreed upon by the
parties in the course of the said hearing, the case was returned to the First
Division which prompt­ly issued another Notice of Hearing dated January 10,
1968 (* * *) scheduling a full hearing on January 24, 1968, during which the
peti­tioner * * * and the herein respondent [Eastern <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>
Bus Co.] argued and presented pertinent evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true then that the order of November 2, 1967 was
issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, it is equally true
that whatever objections could have been raised by petitioner were in fact set
forth in its petition to set aside and to reconsider and <span style="">were </span>inquired
into in a hearing held on January 24, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far back as 1935,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
it has already been a settled doctrine that a plea of denial of procedural due
process does not lie where a defect consisting of an absence of notice of
hearing was thereafter cured by the alleged aggrieved party having had the
oppor­tunity to be heard on a motion for <span style="">reconsideration. </span>"What the law prohibits is not the absence
of <u>previous</u> notice, but the absolute ab­sence thereof and lack of
opportunity to be heard."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
There is then no occasion to impute deprivation of property without due process
where the adverse party was heard on a motion for reconsideration constitu­ting
as it does "sufficient opportunity" for him to inform the Tribunal
concerned of his side of <span style="">the
controversy.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>As was stated in a recent decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
what "due process contemplates is freedom from arbitrariness and what it
requires is fairness or justice, the substance rather than the form being
paramount," the conclusion being that the hearing on a motion for
reconsideration meets the strict requirement of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is all then that this petition presents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly it should be dismissed for it is
bereft of any support in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A word
more however is required in view of the conspicuous failure of petitioner's
counsel to exhibit the candor required of an officer of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition, as shown in the motion to
dismiss and in the course of the oral argu­ment, left out many facts within the
<span style="">knowledge </span>of the petitioner with
the evident purpose of imparting a semblance of plausibility to a petition
otherwise clearly lacking merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
counsel is expected to exhibit the utmost zeal on behalf of a client, it is
likewise imperative if the rule of law were to be truly meaningful that the
orders of this Court be based on a full and candid disclosure of relevant matters,
so that what­ever action may thereafter be taken be warranted by the events as
they did transpire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Members of the Bar
would then be remiss in their duty towards a court of justice if in their
undoubtedly earnest efforts to serve their client's cause, there is, as in this
case, a failure to live up to their exacting responsibility to exert the utmost
diligence that their pleadings submitted reflect the facts with truth and
accuracy.</p>
