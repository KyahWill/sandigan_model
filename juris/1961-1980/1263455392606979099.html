				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the defendant City of Iloilo from the decision of the
Court of First Instance of Iloilo, declaring illegal Ordinance 11, series of
1960, entitled, "An Ordinance Imposing Municipal License Tax On Persons
Engaged In The Business Of Operating Tenement Houses," and ordering the
City to refund to the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> the sums
of money collected from them under the said ordinance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 30, 1946 the municipal board of Iloilo City enacted
Ordinance 86, imposing license tax fees as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) tenement house (casa de <span class="SpellE">vecindad</span>), P25.00 annually; (2) tene­ment house, partly or
wholly engaged in or dedicated to business in the streets of J.M. <span class="SpellE">Basa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isnart</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aldeguer</span>, P24.00 per apartment; (3) tenement house, partly
or wholly engaged in busi­ness in any other streets, P12.00 per apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity and constitutionality of this
ordinance were challenged by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Sian</span>
Villanueva, owners of four tenement houses containing 34 apartments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in <u>City of Iloilo vs. <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Sian</span> Villanueva<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
Villanueva</u>, L-12695, <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="3">March 23,
 1959</st1:date>, declared the ordinance <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>,
"it not appearing that the power to tax owners of tenement houses is one
among those clearly and expressly granted to the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
by its Charter."</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1960 the municipal board of Iloilo City,
believing, obviously, that with the passage of Republic Act 2264, otherwise
known as the Local Autonomy Act, it had acquired the authority or power to
enact an ordinance similar to that previous­ly declared by this Court as <u>ultra</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>, enacted Ordinance 11 (eleven), series
of 1960, hereunder quoted in full:</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 11, 1962 and April 24, 1964, the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed a complaint, and an amended complaint,
respectively, against the City of Iloilo, in the aforementioned court, praying
that Ordi­nance 11, series of 1960, be declared "invalid for being beyond
the powers of the Municipal Council of the City of Iloilo to enact, and
unconstitutional for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the rule as
to uniformity of taxation and for depriving said plaintiffs of the equal
protection clause of the Constitution," and that the City be ordered to
refund the amounts collected from them under the said ordinance.</p>

the lower court rendered judgment declaring the ordinance illegal on the
grounds that (a) "Republic Act 2264 does not empower cities to impose
apartment taxes," (b) the same is "oppressive and unreasonable,"
for the reason that it penalizes owners of tenement houses who fail to pay the
tax, (c) it constitutes "not only double taxation, but treble at
that," and (d) it violates the rule of uniformity of taxation.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provisions
of the Local Autonomy Act are hereunder quoted:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2. - Any provision of law to the con­trary
notwithstanding, all chartered cities, muni­cipalities and municipal districts
shall have autho­rity to impose municipal license taxes or fees upon persons
engaged in any occupation or business, or exercising privileges in chartered
cities, munici­palities or municipal districts by requiring them to secure
licenses at rates fixed by the municipal board or city council of the city, the
municipal council of the municipality, or the municipal dis­trict council of
the municipal district; to collect fees and charges for services rendered by
the ci­ty, municipality or municipal district; to regulate and impose
reasonable fees for services rendered in connection with any business,
profession or oc­cupation being conducted within the city, municipa­lity or
municipal district and otherwise to levy for public purposes, just and uniform
taxes, licenses or fees; <u>Provided</u>, That municipalities and muni­cipal districts
shall, in no case, impose any per­centage tax on sales or other taxes in any
form based thereon nor impose taxes on articles sub­ject to specific tax,
except gasoline, under the provisions of the National Internal Revenue
Code:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, That
no city, municipality or municipal district may levy or impose any of the
following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a) Residence tax;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) Documentary stamp tax;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) Taxes on the business of persons en­gaged in the printing
and publication of any news­paper, magazine, review or bulletin appearing at
regular intervals and having fixed prices for sub­scription and sale, and which
is not published primarily for the purpose of publishing advertisements;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d) Taxes on persons operating waterworks, irrigation and
other public utilities except electric light, heat and power;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e) Taxes on forest products and forest concessions;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(f) Taxes on
estates, inheritance, gifts, legacies, and other acquisitions <u>mortis</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(g) Taxes on
income of any kind whatsoever;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(h) Taxes or fees for the registration of motor vehicles and
for the issuance of all kinds of licenses or permits for the driving thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) Customs duties registration, <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues on wharves owned by the national government,
ton­nage, and all other kinds of customs fees, charges and duties;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(j) Taxes of any kind on banks, insurance companies, and
persons paying franchise tax; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(k) Taxes on premiums paid by owners of property who obtain
insurance directly with foreign insurance companies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A tax ordinance shall go into effect on the fifteenth day
after its passage, unless the ordi­nance shall provide otherwise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, That the
Secretary of Finance shall have authority to suspend the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of any ordinance within one hundred and twenty days after its passage, if, in
his opinion, the tax or fee therein levied or imposed is unjust, excessive,
oppressive, or confis­catory, and when the said Secretary exercises this
authority the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of such ordinance shall be
suspended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In such event, the municipal board or city council in the
case of cities and the municipal coun­cil or municipal district council in the
case of municipalities or municipal districts may appeal the decision of the
Secretary of Finance to the court during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of which case the tax levied shall be considered as paid under protest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is now settled that the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provisions of Repu­blic Act 2264 confer on local governments broad taxing
authority which extends to almost "everything, excepting those which are
mentioned therein," provided that the tax so levied is "for public
purposes, just and uniform," and does not transgress any constitutional
provision or is not repugnant to a controlling statute.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, when a tax levied under the authority of a city or municipal ordinance,
is not within the exceptions and limitations afore­mentioned, the same comes
within the ambit of the general rule, pursuant to the rules of <span class="SpellE"><u>expressio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>unius</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>est</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>exclusio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>alterius</u></span>, and <span class="SpellE"><u>exceptio</u></span>

<u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>casibus</u></span> <u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>excepti</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Does the tax imposed by the ordinance in question fall within any
of the exceptions provided for in section 2 of the Local Autonomy Act?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, it is necessary to
determine the true nature of the tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> strongly maintain that it is a
"property tax" or "real estate tax,"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

privileges," or a license tax, or a privilege tax, or an excise tax.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the title of the ordinance designates it as a "municipal <u>license
tax</u> on <u>persons engaged</u> in the <u>business</u> of <u>operating tene­ment
houses</u>," while section 1 thereof states that a "municipal <u>license
tax</u> is hereby <u>imposed on tenement houses</u>." It is the
phraseology of section 1 on which the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> base
their contention that the tax involved is a real estate tax which, according to
them, makes the ordinance <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>
as it imposes a levy<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> "in
excess of the one <span class="SpellE">percentum</span> real estate tax allowable
under Sec. 38 of the Iloilo City Charter, Com. Act 158."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is our view, contrary to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'

subject to such taxation, and not by imprisonment of the owner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tax imposed by the ordinance in question does not possess the
<span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> attributes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a tax on the land on which the
tenement houses are erected, although both land and tenement houses may belong
to the same owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tax is not a
fixed proportion of the assessed value of the tenement houses, and does not
require the intervention of assessors or appraisers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not payable at a designated time or
date, and is not enforce­able against the tenement houses either by sale or <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
therefore, the tax in question is not a real estate tax.</p>

It is within neither the letter nor the spirit of the ordinance that an
additional real estate tax is being imposed, otherwise the subject-matter would

</span>On the contrary, it is plain from the context of the ordinance that the
intention is to impose a license tax on the operation of tenement houses, which
is a form of business or calling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ordinance, in both its title and body, particularly sections 1 and 3 thereof, designates
the tax imposed as a "muni­cipal license tax" which, by itself, means
an "imposition or exaction on the right to use or dispose of property, to
pursue a business, occupation, or calling, or to exercise a privilege."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">"The character of a tax is not to be fixed by any isolated
words that may be employed in the statute creating it, but such words must be
taken in the connection in which they are used, and the true character is to be
deduced from the nature and essence of the subject."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The subject-matter of the ordinance is tenement houses whose nature and essence
are expressly set forth in section 2 which defines a tenement house as
"any build­ing or dwelling <u>for renting space</u> divided into separate
apart­ments or <span class="SpellE">accessorias</span>." The Supreme Court,
in <u>City of Iloilo vs. <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Sian</span>
Villanueva, et al</u>., L-12695, March 23, 1959, adopted the definition of a
tenement house<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
as "any house or building, or portion thereof, which is <u>rented</u>, <u>leased</u>,
or <u>hired</u> <u>out to be occupied,</u> or <u>is occupied</u>, as the home
or residence of three families or more living independently of each other and
doing their cooking in the premises, or by more than two fami­lies upon any
floor, so living and cooking, but having a common right in the halls,
stairways, yards, water-closets, or privies, or some of them." Tenement
houses, being necessarily offered for rent or lease by their very nature and
essence, therefore constitute a <u>distinct form</u> of business or calling,
similar to the hotel or motel business, or the operation of lodging houses or boarding
houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely one of the
reasons why this Court, in the said case of City of Iloilo vs. <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Sian</span> Villanueva, et al.,
<u>supra</u>, declared Ordinance 86 <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>,
because, although the municipal board of Iloilo City is empowered, under sec.
21, par. j, of its Charter, "to tax, fix the license fee for, and regulate
<u>hotels</u>, restaurants, refreshment parlors, cafes, <u>lodging houses</u>, <u>boarding
houses</u>, livery garages, public ware­houses, pawnshops, theaters,
cinematographs," tenement hous­es, <u>which constitute a different
business enterprise</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
are not mentioned in the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> section of the
City Charter of Iloilo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the
aforesaid case, this Court explicitly said:</p>

<blockquote>"And it not appearing that the power to tax <u>owner's of
tenement houses</u> is one among those clearly and expressly granted to the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city> by its Charter, the
exercise of such power cannot be assumed and hence the ordinance in question is
<u>ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></u> insofar as it <u>taxes a tenement
house</u> such as those belonging to defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court has interchangeably denominated the tax in
question as a tenement tax or an apartment tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Called by either name, it is not among the exceptions listed in section
2 of the Loc­al Autonomy Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the imposition by the ordi­nance of a license tax on persons
engaged in the business of ope­rating tenement houses finds authority in
section 2 of the Local Autonomy Act which provides that chartered cities have
the autho­rity to impose municipal license taxes or fees upon persons en­gaged
in any occupation or business, or exercising privileges within their respective
territories, and "otherwise to levy for public purposes, just and uniform
taxes, licenses, or fees."</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The trial court condemned the ordinance as constituting "not
only double taxation but treble at that," because "buildings pay real
estate taxes and also income taxes as provided for in Sec. 182(A)(3)(s) of the
National Internal Revenue Code, besides the tene­ment tax under the said
ordinance." Obviously, what the trial court refers to as "income
taxes" are the fixed taxes on business and occupation provided for in
section 182, Title V, of the Natio­nal Internal Revenue Code, by virtue of
which persons engaged in "leasing or renting property, whether on their
account as princi­pals or as owners of rental property or properties," are
consi­dered "real estate dealers" and are taxed according to the
amount of their annual income."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are taxable under the aforesaid provisions of the National Internal Revenue
Code as real estate dealers, and still taxable under the ordinance in question,
the argument against double taxation may not be in­voked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same tax may be imposed by the national
government as well as by the local government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing inherently obnoxious in the exaction of license fees or
taxes with respect to the same occupation, calling or activity by both the
State and a political subdivision thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are doubly taxed because they are paying the real estate taxes and the tenement
tax imposed by the ordinance in question, is also devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a well-settled rule that a license tax
may be levied upon a business or occupation although the land or property used
in connection therewith is subject to property tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State may collect an <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax on property used in a calling, and at
the same time impose a license tax on that calling, the imposition of the
latter kind of tax being in no sense a double tax.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">"In order to constitute double taxation in the objectionable
or prohibited sense the same property must be taxed twice when it should be
taxed but once; both taxes must be imposed on the same property or
subject-matter, for the same purpose, by the same State, Government, or taxing
authority, within the same jurisdiction or taxing district, during the same
taxing period, and they must be the same kind or character of tax."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been shown that a real estate tax and the tenement tax imposed by the
ordinance, although imposed by the same taxing authority, are not of the same
kind or character.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, there is no constitutional prohibition against
double taxation in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
It is something not favored, but is permissible, provided some other
constitutional requirement is not thereby violated, such as the requirement
that taxes must be uniform.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">3. The appellant City takes exception to the conclusion of the
lower court that the ordinance is not only oppressive be­cause it "carries
a penal clause of a fine of P200.00 or imprisonment of 6 months or both, if the
owner or owners of the tene­ment buildings divided into apartments do not pay
the tenement or apartment tax fixed in said ordinance," but also
unconstitutio­nal as it subjects the owners of tenement houses to criminal
prosecution for "non-payment of an obligation which is purely sum of
money." The lower court apparently had in mind, when it made the above
ruling, the provision of the Constitution that "no person shall be
imprisoned for a debt or non-payment of a poll tax."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
It is elementary, however, that "a tax is not a debt in the sense of an
obligation incurred by contract, express or implied, and therefore is not
within the meaning of constitutional or statutory provisions abolishing or prohibiting
imprisonment for debt, and a statute or ordinance which punishes the non-payment
thereof by fine or imprisonment is not in conflict with that prohibition."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor is the tax in question a poll tax, for the latter is a tax of a fixed
amount upon all persons, or upon all persons of a certain class, resident
within a specified territory, without regard to their property or the
occupations in which they may be engaged.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Therefore, the tax in question is not oppressive in the manner the lower court
puts it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the charter
of <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
empowers its municipal board to "fix penalties for viola­tions of
ordinances, which shall not exceed a fine of two hundred pesos or six months'
imprisonment, or both such fine and imprisonment for each offense." In <span class="SpellE"><u>Punsalan</u></span><u>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Mun</span>.
Board of Manila</u>, <u>supra</u>, this Court overruled the pronouncement of
the lower court declaring illegal and void an ordinance imposing an occupation
tax on persons exercising various professions in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
because it imposed a penalty of fine and imprisonment for its violation.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4. The trial court brands the ordinance as <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the rule of uniformity of taxation.</p>

<blockquote>". . . . because while the owners of the other buildings only
pay real estate tax and in­come taxes the ordinance imposes aside from these
two taxes an apartment or tenement tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that in the assessment of real estate tax all parts
of the building or buildings are included so that the corresponding real estate
tax could be properly imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If aside
from the real estate tax the owner or owners of the tenement buildings should
pay apartment taxes as required in the ordinance then it will violate the rule
of uniformity of taxation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Complementing the above ruling of the
lower court, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> argue that there is
"lack of uniformity" and "relative inequality,"<br>
because "only the taxpayers of the City of Iloilo are singled out to pay
taxes on their tenement houses, while citizens of other cities, where their
councils do not enact a similar tax ordinance, are permitted to escape such
imposition."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our view that both assertions are undeserving of extended
attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has already ruled
that tenement houses constitute a distinct class of property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has likewise ruled that "taxes are
uniform and equal when imposed upon all property of the same class or character
within the taxing authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact, therefore, that the owners of other classes of buildings in the City
of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city> do not pay the taxes
imposed by the ordinance in question is no argument at all against uniformi­ty
and equality of the tax imposition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is the rule of equa­lity and uniformity violated by the fact
that tenement taxes are not imposed in other cities, for the same rule does not
require that taxes for the same purpose should be imposed in different
territorial subdivisions at the same time.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
So long as the bur­den of the tax falls equally and impartially on all owners
or operators of tenement houses similarly classified or situated, equality and
uniformity of taxation is accomplished.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
The plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, as owners of tenement
houses in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, have
not shown that the tax burden is not equally or uniformly distributed among
them, to overthrow the presumption that tax statutes are intended to operate
uniformly and equally.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">5. The last important issue posed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
is that since the ordinance in the case at bar is a mere reproduction of
Ordinance 86 of the City of Iloilo which was declared by this Court in L-12695,
<u>supra</u>, as <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>, the
decision in that case should be accorded the effect of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> in the present case or should
constitute <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To dispose of this conten­tion, it suffices
to say that there is no identity of subject-matter in that case and this case
because the subject-matter in L-12695 was an ordinance which dealt not only
with tenement houses but also warehouses, and the said ordinance was enacted
pursuant to the provisions of the City charter, while the ordinance in the case
at bar was enacted pursuant to the provisions of the Local Autono­my Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is likewise no identity of cause of
action in the two cases because the main issue in L-12695 was whether the City
of Iloilo had the power under its charter to impose the tax levied by Ordinance
86, while one of the issues in the present case is whe­ther the City is
empowered to impose the tax levied by Ordinance 11, series of 1960, under the
Local Autonomy Act which took ef­fect on June 19, 1959, and therefore was not
available for consi­deration in the decision in L-12695 which was promulgated
on March 23, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, under the
provisions of section 2 of the Local Autonomy Act, local governments may now
tax any tax­able subject-matter or object not included in the enumeration of
matters removed from the taxing power of local governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the enactment of the Local Autonomy
Act the taxes that could be legally levied by local governments were only those
spe­cifically authorized by law, and their power to tax was construed <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>strictissimi</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Com. Act No. 158 (An Act Establishing a Form of Government for the City of
Iloilo), section 21:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Except as

"To begin with the defendants' appeal, we find that the lower court was in
error in saying that the imposition of the penalty provided for in the
ordinance was without the authority of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last paragraph (<span class="SpellE">kk</span>) of the very sec­tion
that authorizes the enactment of the ordinance (sec­tion 18 of the Manila
Charter) in express terms also empowers the Municipal Board to 'fix penalties
for the vio­lation of ordinances which not exceed to [sic] two hun­dred pesos
fine or six months' imprisonment, or both such fine and imprisonment, for a
single offense.' Hence, the pronouncement below that the ordinance in question
is illegal and void because it imposes a penalty not authorized by law is
clearly without legal basis."</p>

taxation if all arti­cles or kinds of property of the same class are taxed at
the same rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was held in that
case, that 'the fact that some places of amusement are not taxed while others,
such as cinematographs, theaters, vaudeville companies, theatrical shows, and
boxing exhibitions and other kinds of amusements or places of amusement are
taxed, is no argument at all against equality and uniformity of the tax
imposition.' Applying this criterion to the present case, there would be
discrimination if some boarding stables of the same class used for the same
number of horses were not taxed or were made to pay less or more than
others." Tan Kim <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <i>vs.</i> Court of Tax

</span>"153. Uniformity of Operation Throughout Tax Unit. - One
requirement with respect to taxation imposed by provisions relating to equality
and uniformity, which has been introduced into some state constitutions in
express language, is that taxation must be uniform through­out the political
unit by or with respect to which the tax is levied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means, for example, that a tax for a
state purpose must be uniform and equal throughout the state, a tax for a
county purpose must be uniform and equal throughout the county, and a tax for a
city, village, or township purpose must be uniform and equal throughout the
city, village, or township.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
mean, however, that the taxes levied by or with respect to the various po­litical
subdivisions or taxing districts of the state must be at the same rate, or, as
one court has graphically pat it, that a man in one county shall pay the same
rate of tax­ation for all purposes that is paid by a man in an adjoining
county. <u>Nor does the rule require that taxes for the same purposes shall be
imposed in different territorial subdivisions at the same time</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has also been said in this con­nection
that the omission to tax any particular individual who may be liable does not
render the whole tax illegal or void."</p>
