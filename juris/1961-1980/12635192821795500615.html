				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On October 2, 1964, the <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> Industrial
and Development Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the BIDCOR) filed with
the Director of Forestry (hereinafter referred to as the Director) a
letter-complaint (dated September 29, 1964) against the R.C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> Timber and Plywood Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred
to as the TIMPLY) and its president, Rafael C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
asking for the immediate suspension and then cancellation of Timber License
Agreement 68 in the name of the TIMPLY and of the Ordinary Road Right-of-Way
Permit 237 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and the TIMPLY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The BIDCOR alleged as grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> <span class="SpellE">TIMPLY's</span> violation of
the terms and conditions of its timber license agreement and ordinary road
right-of-way permit, as well as its disregard of forestry laws, rules and
regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The TIMPLY, on October 8, 1964, moved to dismiss the
letter-complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director, however,
considered the numerous charges "worth looking into" and requiring
"a thorough inquiry by an appropriate committee" for a determination
of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated December 15,
1964, the Director deferred re<span style="">solution
on the <span class="SpellE">TIMPLY's</span> motion to dismiss until after proper
hearing on the letter-complaint, and created a committee to conduct the
necessary investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, on January
8, 1965, the TIMPLY moved to set aside the Director's order creating the
investigation committee, which motion the Director denied in an order dated
January 25, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director also
ordered the resumption of the investigation of the charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The TIMPLY, in a letter dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January
 8, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, appealed
the aforementioned order of the Director (dismissing its motion to set aside
the previous order creating the investigation committee) to the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, praying that the said Secretary order the
Director to suspend or stop the investigatory hearings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, the
committee convened by the Director continued proceedings on the <span class="SpellE">BIDCOR's</span> letter-complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">January 29, 1965, the
TIMPLY filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
a petition entitled "Injunction with Preliminary Injunction and
Damages," docketed as special civil case 185.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The TIMPLY sought the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction
restraining the Director and five other forestry officials - three of whom
belong to the investigating committee from continuing the hearing on the <span class="SpellE">BIDCOR's</span> charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the same day, presiding judge Jesus S. Ruiz of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
issued an order giving due course to the petition and requiring the Director
and other forestry officials and the BIDCOR to answer the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also issued and granted, upon the filing
of the requisite bond, a writ of preliminary injunction restraining and
prohibiting the Director, the other forestry officials, their agents,
representatives, attorneys, or any other person acting in their behalf from
continuing with the investigation of the charges filed by the BIDCOR against
the TIMPLY, and issuing any order or resolution pertinent to the
letter-complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">February 5, 1965, the
Director and </span>the <span style="">other forestry
officials, through the Solicitor General, filed with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
a motion asking for leave to file a motion to dismiss instead of an
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the BIDCOR filed a
motion, seeking permission to file a motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both motions sought the dismissal of the
TIMPLY petition on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and lack of cause of action due to non-exhaustion of
administrative remedies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The TIMPLY, on February
28, 1965, filed its opposition to the aforesaid motions for dismissal of its
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 8, 1965, the BIDCOR
filed its rejoinder to the <span class="SpellE">TIMPLY's</span> opposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Resolving the motions,
Judge Ruiz, on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3"><span style="">March 31, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, issued an order denying the motions to
dismiss for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The forestry
officials moved for reconsideration of this denial on April 23, 1965 and the
BIDCOR did the same on April 28, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court denied these motions for reconsideration in an order
dated July 12, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the present
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary injunction
filed by the BIDCOR and the forestry officials.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To restrain and prohibit
the respondents and their </span>agents <span style="">and
their representatives from enforcing the lower court's order and writ of
preliminary injunction, both dated January 29, 1965, and from conducting
further proceedings re the petition filed by the respondent TIMPLY, this Court,
at the instance of the petitioners, issued a preliminary injunctive writ on
August 24, 1965, enjoining the respondents from committing the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> acts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The central question
posed by the petition at bar is whether or not the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> has jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary
injunction restraining administrative officers from proceeding with an official
investigation outside of the province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners rely
mainly on paragraph (h) of section 44 of Republic Act 296, as amended, to
support their theory that the lower court has no jurisdiction to issue the
injunctive writ in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
(h) of section 44 provides that courts of first instance and their judges, or
any of them, "shall have the power to issue writs of injunction, <i>mandamus</i>,
<i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and
habeas corpus in their respective provinces and districts, in the manner
provided in the Rules of Court.‚Äù<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Interpreted and applied
properly, the petitioners maintain, paragraph (h) limits the jurisdiction or
authority of courts of first instance to control or restrain acts by means of
the writ of preliminary injunction to those acts being committed or about to be
committed within the territorial boundaries of their respective provinces and
districts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> has no jurisdiction at all to
enjoin the official investigation being conducted in the city of Manila of the
charges by the petitioner BIDCOR against the respondent TIMPLY.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners also rely
upon <u>Acosta et al. vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span> and De Santos
Agricultural Development Inc</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where this Court held that paragraph (h)
defines and limits the jurisdiction of courts of first instance to issue writs
of injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">This
Court there stated that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under section 2, Rule 60<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules of Court, a preliminary injunction may be granted by the Judge of
the Court of First Instance 'in any action pending in his district.' These
provisions clearly show that the jurisdiction or authority of courts of first
instance to control or restrain acts by means of the writ of injunction is
limited to acts which are being committed or about to be committed within the
territorial boundaries of their respective provinces and districts."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
respondents argue that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> has jurisdiction to issue
the writ of injunction involved herein, citing in support thereof section 3 of
Rule 135 of the Rules of Court and <span class="SpellE"><u>Gayacao</u></span><u>
vs. Hon. Executive Secretary of the President of the Philippines, et al</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Section 3 of Rule 135 reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3. <u>Process of superior courts enforced throughout the
Philippines</u>. - Process issued from a superior court in which a case is
pending to bring in a defendant, or for the arrest of any accused person, or to
execute any order or judgment of the court, may be enforced in any part of the
Philippines."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">According
to the respondent TIMPLY, the aforesaid section permits the enforceability of
any process for the execution of any order or judgment of courts of first
instance throughout the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To further strengthen its
stand, the respondent TIMPLY asserts that the pronouncement of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gayacao</u></span> is applicable to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said case, the respondent TIMPLY </span><span style="">alleges, this Court held that the power of
judicial review of courts should not be confined "to courts of first
instance of the locality where the offices of respondents are maintained, to
the exclusion of the courts of first instance in those localities where the
plaintiffs reside, and where the questioned decisions are being enforced."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the contention of
the respondent TIMPLY untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A distinction exists
between the ruling of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gayacao</u></span>
cited by the respondents and that in </span><u><span style="">Acosta</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">relied upon by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This difference we have recognized in several
cases.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner in <span class="SpellE">Gayacao</span> sought judicial review of the decision of the
Director of Lands and the subsequent <span class="SpellE">affirmatory</span>
decisions of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the
Executive Secretary by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>
City. "The remedy sought was the judicial review of the administrative
decision in question and its annulment on account of errors of law allegedly
committed." The sole point in controversy related to a determination of
"whether the decision of the respondent public officers was legally
correct or not." This Court therein stated that "the power of
provincial courts of first instance to review administrative decisions of
national officials has been consistently recognized."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We subsequently applied
the same rule in <span class="SpellE"><u>Zamboanga</u></span><u> General
Utilities Inc</u>., <u>supra</u>, wherein, similarly as in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Gayacao</u></span>, <span style="">the
party-litigants raised the question of whether or not the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City has the power to review the
decision of the Director of Lands and the <span class="SpellE">affirmatory</span>
decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also said in this case that a different
rule applies to petitions for injunction seeking to control the actions of
courts and officers, reiterating that the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(J)<span class="SpellE">urisdiction</span> or authority of
Courts of First Instance to control or restrain acts by<span style="">&nbsp; </span>means of the writ of injunction is limited to
<span style="">acts which are being committed or about
to be committed within the territorial boundaries of their respective provinces
or districts."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Palanan</u></span><u>
Lumber and Plywood Co., I</u></span><u><span style="">nc.</span></u><span style="">, </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">we re-affirmed the rule of non-jurisdiction
of courts of first instance to issue injunctive writs in order to control acts
outside of their provinces or districts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We went further and said that when the petition filed with the court of
first instance not only questions the legal correctness of the decision of
administrative officials but also seeks to enjoin the enforcement of the said
decision, the court could not validly issue the writ of injunction when the
officials sought to be restrained from enforcing the decision are not stationed
within its territory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To recapitulate, insofar
as injunctive or prohibitory writs are concerned, the rule still stands that
courts of first instance have the power to issue writs limited to and operative
only within their respective provinces or districts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondents also
attempt to show that section 3 of Rule 135 of the Rules of Court sanctions the
enforceability of the orders, processes and judgments of courts of first
instance throughout the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe however that the provisions of paragraph (h) of section 44 of R. A.
296, as amended, preclude any such comprehensive construction of section 3 of
Rule 135, for the former denies the courts of first instance authority to issue
injunctive writs affecting acts or persons beyond the territorial boundaries of
their respective provinces or districts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Paragraph (h) of section
44 of R.A. 296, as amended, treats of the definition and limitation of the
jurisdiction of courts of first instance, whereas section 3 of Rule 135 of the
Rules of Court deals with the enforceability of the orders, judgments or
processes of courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, section 2 of Article VIII of the Constitution lodges with
Congress "the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction
of the various courts.</span><span style="">" As </span><span style="">a legislative act enacted pursuant to a
constitutional mandate, paragraph (h) of section 44 of R. A. 296 defining the
jurisdiction of courts of first instance re the issuance of writs of
injunction, <i>mandamus</i>, <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and habeas corpus, restricts the applicability of
section 3 of Rule 135 promulgated by this Court whose rule-making power section
13 of Article VIII of the Constitution limits to matters concerning
"pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, an</span><span style="">d </span><span style="">the
admission to the practice of law."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In line, therefore, with
the authorities <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> limiting the power of
courts of first instance to control or restrain by means of the writ of
injunction to acts being committed or about to be committed within the territorial
boundaries of their respective provinces and districts, we hold that the writ
of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent judge of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> restraining the continuation of
the investigatory proceedings being conducted by the petitioning forestry
officials in Manila, is null and void for want of jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY,</span></b><span style=""> the petition is hereby granted, and the writ
of preliminary injunction dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="8"><span style="">August </span><span style="">24, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">
