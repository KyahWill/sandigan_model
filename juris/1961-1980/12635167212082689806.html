<p class="BODY">In their complaint, plaintiffs Eduardo, <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Agripina</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>,
Aurora and Alessandro, all surnamed Villanueva, substantially allege:</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that they are the legitimate children and
successors in interest of Alberto Villanueva and Paz <span class="SpellE">Galberion</span>
- hereinafter re­ferred to as Mr. &amp; Mrs. Villanueva - who, during their
lifetime, were the absolute owners of half of a land of about 7.1186 hectares,
situated in Gaud, <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, Iloilo, more particularly
described in the complaint and designated as Lot No. 2309 of the <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span> Cadas­tre;</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that said lot is a private agricultural land
whose original owner, Jose <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span>, first mortgaged
and then sold one-half (1/2) thereof to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Villanueva, as evidenced
by a deed of sale in their favor, dated April 28, 1941, copy of which is
attached to the complaint as Annex A;</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that, since April 28, 1941, Mr. &amp; Mrs.
Villanueva had occupied and worked on said land peacefully, continuously,
publicly and adversely to the whole world, as owners thereof, until their de­mise,
when their children, plaintiffs herein, took over and continued to possess the
land, in the same concept, up to the present;</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that, plaintiff Antonio Villanueva was surprised
when he was summoned in connection with a complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> filed, against him and his co-plaintiffs, by
herein defendants <span class="SpellE">Priscilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Portigo</span>
and Fe <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span> - hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> -in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>,

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that upon a thorough investigation, thereafter,
plaintiffs herein discovered and found that herein defendants Aurora <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span> - a daughter of Jose <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span>,
the original owner - and her husband, Juan Perez - both hereinafter referred to
as the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span> - had surrepti­tiously applied for a
free patent to said Lot 2309, alleging falsely that the same is a public land,
not claimed by any person, and that said applicants were cultivating the land,
"knowing fully well that these allegations are not true because the
plaintiffs and their prede­cessors in interest are the ones possessing the land
in question," (although the annexes attached to the petition suggest that
Mrs. Perez, or Aurora <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span>, was the only applicant
for a free patent);</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(f)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that notice of said free patent application was
never published and, hence, plaintiffs herein had no opportunity to con­test
it;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(g)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that, in consequence of said fraudulent acts and
untruth­ful statements of the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span>, the Director
of Lands - who is, also, a defendant in this case - was misled into approving
said free patent application and causing to be issued, on June 14, 1956, in
their (<span class="SpellE">Pereces</span>) favor, Free Patent No. V-43391, which
is reproduced in Original Certificate of Title No. 181, copy of which is
attached to the complaint, as Annex C (which shows, however, that the, patent
and OCT No. 181 were issued to "Aurora J. de Perez" only);</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(h)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that, being a private land, the one in question
could not have been the subject of an application for free patent, and the
Director of Lands had no authority to cause the same to be issued;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(i)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that, on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1966</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span> fraudulently exe­cuted
a deed of sale - copy of which is attached to the complaint as Annex D - of the
land in question to the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> - in whose favor
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1355, copy of which is attached to the
complaint as Annex B, was issued - who "were very much aware that the
plaintiffs have always been in possession" of said land since the death of
their parents, and that plaintiffs are owners there­of, as evidenced by the
aforementioned deed of conveyance Annex A (Annex D was executed by Aurora J. de
Perez, with the marital con­sent of her husband);</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(j)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that, pretending to act in good faith and in
order to harass the plaintiffs, the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> filed
said unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case, in the municipal court
of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, alleging falsely that plaintiffs herein
were illegally detaining the land in question; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(k)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->that, owing to the foregoing illegal and
fraudulent acts of the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span>, plaintiffs herein have been constrained to engage
the services of counsel, for which they have to pay P500, as attorney's fees,
apart from suffering moral damages, in the sum of P7, 000, and incurring actual
expenses in the sum of P300.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs prayed, therefore, that judgment be rendered annul­ling
said Free Patent No. V-43391 and OCT No. 181, Annex C, as well as the deed of
sale, Annex D, and TCT No. T-1355, Annex B, and that the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> be, moreover, sentenced to pay to
the plaintiffs the abovementioned sums of P7, 000, as moral damages, P500, as
attorney's fees, and P300, as actual expenses, apart from the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands filed an answer admitting some alle­gations
of the complaint, denying other allegations thereof and setting up special
defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being served with <span style="">summons; </span>the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> filed a motion to dismiss, alleging:
(1) that "plain­tiffs' action has prescribed", because Free Patent
No. V-43391 and OCT No. 181, Annex C - in the name of Aurora J. de Perez - were
issued on June 14, 1956, or over ten (10) years before the institution of the
present case, <span style="">On </span>July 14, 1966;
and (2) that the court had "no jurisdiction over the nature of the action
or suit," inasmuch as, pursuant to "Section 107, Commonwealth Act No.
141, in relation to Section 122 of Article 496, lands covered by free patent
partakes of the nature of registered land," so that "Original
Certificate of Title No. 181" issued, in pursuance of Free Patent No.
V-43391, in the name of Aurora J. de Perez, "has become indefeasible in
accordance with law.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted this motion to
dismiss, not only for the reasons therein set forth, but, also, upon the
additional ground that the present case "amounts to the reversion of Lot
2309 to form again part of the public domain." A reconsider­ation of the
order of dismissal having been denied, plaintiffs now seek a review thereof by
record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of dismissal appealed from is manifestly erroneous. The
present action can not possibly be regarded as an attempt to bring about a
reversion of the lot in question to the <u><span style="">public</span></u> domain, for the simple reason that plaintiffs aver in
their complaint - and this is deemed to be hypothetically admitted by the
motion to dismiss - that said lot is <u><span style="">privately</span></u><span style=""> </span>owned by them, as it was privately
owned by their parents, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Villanueva, from whom they claim to have
inherited it, and by their parents' predecessor in interest, Jose <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span>- father of Mrs. Perez (Aurora <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span>)
- who (Jose <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span>) conveyed it to Mr. &amp; Mrs.
Villanueva, on April 28, 1941, pursuant to the deed of sale Annex A. In <span class="SpellE">Baladjay</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Castrillo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
we held, apply­ing previous rulings, that:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the legal provision giving the Govern­ment the exclusive authority to seek
cancellation of a title issued in conformity with a homestead patent and
reversion of a land to the public domain are, in the very nature of things,
confined in their application to lands of the <u><span style="">public</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>domain which have been granted by
virtue of such patent in pursuance of the Public Lands Act. They are
inapplicable to <u><span style="">private</span></u><span style=""> </span>lands, not even to those acquired by
the Government by purchase for resale to individuals (<span class="SpellE">Marukot</span>
vs. Jacinto, G.R. No. L-8036­8038, <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1955</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Geukeko</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
G.R. No. L­-10182, <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1957</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendants herein claim, it is true, that Lot No. 2170 is
part of the public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to
dismiss the complaint assumes, however, that its allegations are true, and
plaintiff alleges in her complaint that said lot is her private property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the complaint does not
indicate that plaintiff had derived his title from the Government or that said
lot had ever been under the jurisdiction or management of the Director of
Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the allegations of fact made
in said pleading, plaintiff was not bound, ' therefore, to resort to the
administrative remedies provided in the Public Lands Act as a condition
precedent to a judicial recourse for the protection of his alleged rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether plaintiff is capable of proving the
truth of said allegations is another thing. But this is a matter that will have
to be determined after he has had an opportunity to introduce evidence
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can not be taken up on
motion to dismiss. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">If the land in question was and is of
private ownership, the Director of Lands had no jurisdiction over it, and
neither was it subject to ap­plications for free patent. As a consequence, that
of Aurora J. de Perez should not have been entertained, and said officer had no
authority to approve it, much less to cause to be issued said free patent,
which, accordingly, was null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court held that the present action "has already
pre­scribed" because 'Free Patent No. V-43391 was issued <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>on June
14, 1956" and "became indefeasible after one year from said
date", where­as the case at bar "was filed on July 14, 1966," or
<u>over</u> ten (10) years later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
conclusion is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with,
although Free Patent No. V-43391 is dated <u>June</u> 14, 1956, OCT No. 181 was
not issued until <u>September</u> 28, 1956, when the patent was transcribed in
the Re­gistration Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds <span style="">for the </span>Province of Iloilo, as
attested to in Annex C and stated in Annex B. Indeed, it is well-settled that
"the act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect
the land. "<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Less than ten (10) years had
elapsed from <st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="9"><u>September</u> 28, 1956</st1:date>,
to the institution of this <span style="">action, on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="7"><u><span style="">July</span></u><span style=""> 14, </span>1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, plaintiffs herein seek a relief <span style="">on the ground of </span>fraud. The
corresponding statute of limitations began to run from the accrual of the cause
of action, or "the discovery of the fraud."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> Such
discovery took place shortly after <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="6">June
 8, 1966</st1:date>, when the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> filed the
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case against the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar was instituted on July 14,
1966, or barely a month later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Last, but not least, it should be noted that, pursuant to
explicit and repeated averments in the complaint, the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> had acted in bad faith, with full
knowledge of the factual background of the case, particularly of the sale by
Jose <span class="SpellE">Jiloca</span> to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Villa­nueva, on April
28, 1941, of the public, continuous and adverse posses­sion of the latter,
since that date, as owners of the property, and of the continuation of such
possession, in the same concept, by plaintiffs herein, up to the present. Even
without annulling the two certificates of title involved in this case,
plaintiffs could, therefore, compel the <span class="SpellE">Pereces</span> and
the <span class="SpellE">Portigos</span> to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the land in question to them (plaintiffs), if the allegations of the complaint
were true.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The issuance of the patent and of OCT No. 181 in favor of Aurora
J. de Perez, allegedly through fraud on her part, did not annul or even render
ineffective the deed of conveyance executed by her father. Since her title to
the land in question was derived from the latter, said OCT No. 181 vested in
her the title thereto, but merely in trust, for the benefit of the Villanuevas.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> Hence, Article 1456 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"If property is acquired through x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
fraud, the person obtaining it is, by force of law, considered <u>a trustee of
an implied trust</u> for the benefit of the person from whom the property
comes.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, prima facie, the complaint sets up a cause of action
against the defendants, and plaintiffs are, consequently, entitled to an
opportunity to prove the allegations in their aforementioned pleading.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from should be, as it is
hereby reversed, and this case is, accordingly, remanded to the lower court <span style="">for </span>further proceedings consistently
with this decision, with the costs of this instance against the private defendants
herein.</p>
