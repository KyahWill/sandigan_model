<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 26, 1960, S.G.V.
Chaves, <span class="SpellE">Octaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ladeña</span>,
See <span class="SpellE">Kui</span>, Thomas K.C. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Juico</span>, Jaime A. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
and Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> - hereinafter referred to as Chaves
et al. - commenced Civil Case No. 42650 of the Court of First Instance </span>of
Manila, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Export and Import,
Inc. - hereinafter referred to as the Corporation - against Benito <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>, Jesus S. <span class="SpellE">Tenchavez</span>, Tan
Boon <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>, Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Apacible</span> and Marcos
D. <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> - hereinafter referred <span style="">to </span><span style="">as <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. - to restrain the latter
from holding meetings, passing resolutions or otherwise acting for the
Corporation, upon the ground that they had ceased to be of­ficers thereof and
that Chaves et al. are now the officers </span>of the Corporation, and, as
such, entitled to manage the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Chaves et al., likewise, prayed that defendant <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Apacible</span> be ordered to surrender to them all papers
of the Corporation <span style="">in his possession
and that <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. be sentenced </span><span style="">to pay </span><span style="">damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon later, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al., <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tenchavez</span> and Tan To, instituted Civil Case No. 42704
of the same court, against Chaves et al., for the purpose of securing a judg­ment
declaring that plaintiffs therein, not Chaves et al., are the directors and
officers of the Corporation and order­ing Chaves et al. to refrain from acting
as officers thereof, in addition to sentencing them for damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="3"><span style="">March
 16, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. filed a motion to dis­miss the complaint in
case No. 42650, but, the motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, they filed their answer in case No. 42650, which was
substantially identical to the </span><span style="">allegations
</span><span style="">in the complaint in case No.
42704.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Chaves et al. filed
their answer in said case No. 42704, making substan­tially the same averments
contained in their complaint in case No. 42650.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later on, the Judge presiding Branch XIV of the Court of First Instance
of Manila, to which case No. 42704 had been assigned, issued an order
transferring the same to Branch VIII of the same court, before which </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">No. 42650 was pending, upon the ground that the
issues in case No. 42704 were identical to those raised in the earlier case,
No. 42650.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="1"><span style="">January
 13, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, after a
joint trial, Hon. Juan P. Enriquez, who then presided said Branch VIII,
rendered, in both cases, a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which <span class="GramE">reads:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the
complaint in Civil Case No. 42650 without pronouncement <span style="">as </span>to costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Civil
Case No. 42704 judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the
respondents, declar­ing the former lawfully entitled to the positions claimed
by them in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
are sentenced to pay jointly and severally to complainants moral damages in the
sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and attorney's fees in the sum of
P2,000.00 plus costs, making the preliminary injunction dated <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1960</st1:date> final against the
respondents."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Twenty-eight days after
notice of this decision, or on March 21, 1961, Chaves et al. filed a notice of
appeal, a record on appeal and an appeal bond, in case No. 42650.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al., in
turn, filed, on March 28, 1961, a motion for execution of said decision, upon
the ground that it had become final, no appeal having been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof,
which <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. claimed to be the period applicable,
upon the theory that the two cases are in the nature of <u>quo</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chaves et al., in turn, maintained that they
had thirty (30) days within which to appeal from said decision, because case
No. 42650, they argued, is, not a </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">proceeding,
but an action for injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge
Enriquez overruled this contention and sustained that of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
et al., and, accordingly, refused to give due course to the appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of the order to this effect having been denied
and the motion of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. for a writ of
execution having been granted, Chaves et al. instituted the present case
C.A.-G.R. No. 29254-R of the Court of Appeals, for mandamus, against <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. and Judge Enriquez, to compel the latter to
give due course to said appeal and secure a writ of injunction restraining the
execution of the decision of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After appropriate proceedings, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment
for Chaves et al.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. filed the present petition for review by
certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case hinges on whether said Civil Case No. 42650 is a<span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
proceeding or not, it being conceded that, if the answer were in the
affirmative, the appeal of Chaves et al., from the decision of the trial court,
was taken after <span style="">the same had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We find that the nature of Civil Case No. 42650 as one for
injunction and the sufficiency of the allegations of the complaint to
constitute a cause of action, were sustained by the order of the lower court
denying defendants' motion to dismiss and by the very words of its decision
expressly making reference to Civil Case No. 42650 as an action for
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case having proceeded,
been tried, decided, and an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
perfected on the theory that it was an action for injunction, it was error <span style="">for the lower court to reverse things by
abruptly ruling that the action was ‘more in the nature of </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">rather
than injunction', for the purpose of disallowing the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore, hold that the appeal in Civil
Case No. 42650 for injunction having been perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of 30 <span class="GramE">days,</span>
should have been allowed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We can not accept this
view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the Court of
Appeals did not state why it held case No. 42650 as "one for
injunction." Moreover, it seemingly assumed that said finding negated that
the case was a <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span></span><span style="">
proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such assumption is
unwarranted, for an injunctive relief may, and is often, if not generally, </span>sought
in <span style="">quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the very Court of
Appeals admitted, in its appealed decision, that case No. 42704 "could
have been a combined action for <u>q</u></span><u>uo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
injunction."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the prayer for injunction in case No. 42650 is
predicated upon the allegation that, despite the election and qualification of
Chaves et al., in 1960, as members of the board of directors and officers of
the Corporation, and "knowing full well that they (<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
et al.) are no longer members of the board of directors nor the duly constituted
officers of the corporation," <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al.
"persist and continue to unlawfully represent themselves not only as
members of the board of directors, but, also, as officers of the corporation,
acting on matters affecting the interests of the corporation and
misrepresenting themselves to the public as individually and collectively
acting for and on behalf of the corporation on corporate matters and
affairs." Upon the other hand, in their answer to said complaint, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the
legality of the alleged election and qualification of Chaves et al., as members
of the board of directors and officers of the Corporation, and averred that
they (<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al.) - not Chaves et al. - "are
lawfully entitled to the positions they (<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et
al.) now occupy in the corporation."</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in the case was, therefore, whether or not <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. were board members and officers of the
Corpora­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
proceeding was <u>essentially</u> one for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As pointed out in said answer of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al., in
case No. 42650, the aforementioned "complaint seeks to have" the
Court "look into" their right "to the offices and/or posi­tions
they occupy in the corporation," although they questioned the sufficiency
or regularity of the complaint, the same having been filed in the name of the
Corporation, instead of that of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al., who
claim to be entitled to said offices and/or positions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, the very decision of the Court of Appeals points out the
substantial identity of the allegations, on the one hand, in the complaint of
Chaves et al. in case No. 42650 and their answer in <span style="">case </span>No. 42704, and, on the other, of the com­plaint of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> et al. in case No. 42704 and their answer in case
No. 42650.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the issues in both
cases are admittedly identical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
again, it is not disputed that the complaint in case No. 42704 properly states
that it is one for "quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>," as, in
fact, it is, the injunction therein prayed, <span style="">like </span><span style="">the one applied for
by Chaves et al. in </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">No. 42650, being </span><span style="">merely <u>auxiliary</u> </span><span style="">to or <u>in</u> <u>aid</u> of </span><span style="">the declaration </span><span style="">of lack of title of </span><span style="">their respective opponents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The statement made by the Court of Appeals to the effect that
case No. 42650 had been "tried, decided and the appeal thereon perfected
upon the theory that it was an action for <span style="">injunction,"
is not entirely accurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
paragraph of the decision of the trial court</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> adverted </span>to the fact that <u>each
party claimed </u><u><span style="">title</span></u><span style=""> </span>to the offices in question and <u>assailed
that of their opponents</u> thereto, and that both sought an injunction as a
means to enforce their respective titles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, His Honor the <span style="">trial
Judge had explicitly </span>declared that case No. 42650 was "more in the
nature of quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>than
injunction."</p>

<p class="BODY">One other factor must be reckoned with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in case No. 42704 <span style="">is </span>now
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, no appeal having been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the question as to which of the two groups - <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
et al. or Chaves et al. - are the lawful members of the board of directors and
officers of the Corpora<span style="">tion, has been <u>definitely
settled</u> in said case in favor of the first group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, <u>it may no longer be
litigated</u> in case No. 42650.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The claim of Chaves et al. in such case is <u>now
barred</u> by the decision in case No. 42704.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the appealed decision of the Court of
Appeals is hereby reversed, and the petition for mandamus in the case at bar
should be, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">it is hereby, dismissed and the writ denied,
