				G.R. No. L-18649, December 29, 1967</h4>
				<H3>CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS.
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J. B. L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant Commissioner of Internal Revenue has sought reconsideration
of our main decision in the above entitled case, claiming that this Court has <span class="SpellE">miscontrued</span> the issues involved in this case, and that
instead of resolving what is the market <span style="">value
</span>upon which should be based the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax imposed by section 246 of the Internal Revenue Code, as said section was
amended by Republic Act 1299, in force since June 16, 1955, this Court decided
the case "on an issue that was not raised by them" by ruling
"that cement is not a mineral product but a manufactured product, and as
such it is not subject to the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
<span style="">tax" (Motion for Reconsideration, </span>p.
6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant Commissioner<span style=""> </span>therefore prays that this Court
declare:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) That cement is a mineral product subject to 1-1/2% <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax based on its selling price; or</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) In the alternative, that the sales of cement <span style="">by </span><span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland Cement Company are subject to sales tax of
7%.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reconsideration must be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant Commissioner of Internal
Revenue has plainly <span class="SpellE">miscontrued</span> the language and
import of our main decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We there
stated the issue to be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Herein petitioner<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
contends that the collectible <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax should be based on the actual market <span style="font-size: 12pt;">value of the quarried minerals that were used in the
production of cement; whereas, respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue
maintains that, as the cement produced by petitioner consists of minerals, the
same is a mineral product pursuant to the definition given in Section 246 of
the Tax Code and the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax
should be based on its selling price."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And we sustained the position of the
cement company, i.e. that the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax in question should be based on the actual market value of the <u>quarried
minerals</u> used in producing cement, reasoning that cement (as distinguished
from the original minerals used to produce it) is the result of a process, and
that the same "could not have been the <u>state</u> of mineral products
contemplated by the law" for the purpose of <span style="">imposi</span>ng the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The necessary corollary of this
pronouncement <span style="">is</span> that the law
intended to impose the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax
upon the market value of the component mineral products in their <u>original</u>
<u>state</u> before <u>processing</u> into cement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it can not be overlooked that the law
does not impose a tax on cement <u>qua</u> <u>cement</u>, but on mineral
products, at least 80% of which must be <span style="">minerals
</span>extracted by the lessee, concessionaire or owner of mineral lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties concede that cement is made up
of 80% or more of minerals thus extracted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court did not, and could <span class="GramE">not,</span> rule
that cement is a manufactured product subject to sales tax, for the reason that
such liability had never been litigated by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it <span style="">did </span>declare is that, while cement is a <span style="">mineral </span>product, it is no longer in
the state or condition contemplated by the law; hence the market value of the
cement could not be the basis for computing the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax, since the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax is a
severance tax, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., a charge upon the privilege of
severing or extracting minerals from the earth, (Dec. p. 4) and is due and
payable <u>upon</u> <u>removal</u> of the mineral product from its bed or mine <span style="">(Tax </span>Code s. 245).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that the tax is to be computed on the
basis of the market value of the mineral in its condition at the time of such removal
and before its being substantially changed by chemical or manufacturing (as
distinguished from purely physical) processing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever mention was made in the decision of such process undergone by
the component minerals of cement, was made solely and exclusively to emphasize
the change in the condition of the minerals, from the primitive state
contemplated by the taxing statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is clear from the text of the decision (pp. 4-5) <span style="">where we </span>stated:</p>

<blockquote>"This (respondent's) line of argument suffers from two
infirmities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, <u>while cement</u>
is <u>composed of 80% minerals</u>, it is not merely an admixture or blending
of raw materials, as lime, silica, shale and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the result of a definite process -- the
crushing of minerals, grinding, mixing, <span class="SpellE">calcining</span>,
cooling, <span class="GramE">adding</span> of <span class="SpellE">retarder</span>
or raw gypsum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, before cement
reaches its salable form, the minerals had already <span style="font-size: 12pt;">undergone a chemical change through manufacturing
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This could not have been the
state of </u></span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">mineral
products that the law contemplates</span></u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> for purposes of the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span><u>
tax</u>." (Emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
