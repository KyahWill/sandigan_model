				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pelagio Gutierrez, allegedly an employee of petitioner Ramon Velez, filed 
with the Regional Office No. 7 of the Department of Labor, a complaint (Case No. 
LSC-RO7-50) seeking recovery of unpaid wages and separation pay. After hearing, 
conducted by Gabino Saavedra, Hearing Officer of the Regional Office, and P.G. 
Maliwanag, Associate Commissioner, Labor Standards Commission, judgment was 
rendered sentencing Ramon Velez to pay Pelagio Gutierrez the sum of P1,280.00. A 
writ for the execution of the judgment was issued thru the Provincial Sheriff of 
Misamis Occidental. Claiming that he (Velez) would suffer great and irreparable 
damage and injury, unless the execution of the judgment was restrained and 
alleging that Regional Offices and the Labor Standard Commission are not clothed 
with authority to decide cases of similar nature and that there is no other 
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, Velez filed a 
petition for Prohibition with Injunction, with the CFI of Misamis Occidental, 
(Civil Case No. 2152) praying that an order issue:

<p>On November 10, 1958, and upon the filing of a P2,000.00 bond, the CFI issued 
a writ of Prohibition and Injunction.</p>
<p>Separate Answers were filed by the Respondents, all of which were premised on 
the constitutionality of Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, and the authority of the 
Hearing Officers and Commissioners of the Labor Standards Commission to hear 
and adjudicate cases similar to the one under consideration.</p>
<p>Respondents therein moved to dismiss the petition on the alleged ground that 
it was filed to delay the payment of wages due to respondent Gutierrez, which 
was in effect denied when on June 26, 1959, the lower court handed down an 
Order, which was amended on August 10, 1959, of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court, after having discovered an error in the order dated June 26, 
1959, hereby amends the dispositive part of the said order to read as 
follows:</p>
<p>" 'WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED, making the 
injunction permanent, without special pronouncement as to costs.' 
"</p></blockquote>
<p>The above Order is now before Us on appeal, the Solicitor General urging a 
reversal thereof on two counts, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="95%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td>
<td width="95%">The lower court erred in holding, in effect, that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is unconstitutional; and</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>(a)</td>
<td>The lower court erred in granting the 
petition.</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>The other respondent-appellant Gutierrez adopted the brief of the Solicitor 
General. Appellee did not file his brief.</p>
<p>We have had occasions to dispose of the issues at bar in several recent 
cases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In G. R. No. L-14837, respondent Arturo Delaniel brought a complaint against 
petitioners Jose Corominas, Jr. and Coromdnas, respondent claiming to be a 
driver of the petitioners from January 6, 1956 to August 31, 1956, for which 
services he was not given both overtime and separation pay. He prayed for 
judgment for the amount due him for overtime service rendered and for separation 
pay. Judgment having been rendered in favor of Delaniel by the hearing officer 
of the regional office, appeal therefrom was prosecuted to the Labor Standards 
Commission, which reduced the amount of the judgment to P1,184.28, with legal 
interest and attorney's fees. A 'motion to quash' the decision was denied, and, 
instead, <span style="font-style: italic;">the commissioner of Labor Standards ordered its execution</span>. Thereupon 
petitioners filed this petition for certiorari with prohibition before us, 
alleging that Reorganization Plan No. 20-A is null and void; that the Labor 
Standards Commission and Regional Office No. 3 have no authority and 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the claims for overtime and separation pay of 
respondent Delaniel, in view of which it is prayed that the decision be declared 
null and void and the sheriff be enjoined from executing the same. * * *. </p>
<p>A cursory study of these provisions of Republic Act No. 997 will show that 
nowhere therein is there a grant of authority to the Government Survey and 
Reorganization Commission to grant powers, duties and functions to offices or 
entities to be created by it which are not already granted to the offices or 
officials of the Department of Labor. Section 4 above quoted authorizes the 
elimination of overlapping services, activities and functions, and the 
consolidation of agencies or instrumentalities exercising said duties and 
functions. There is no grant of power to allocate to the bodies and offices to 
be created or set up functions, powers and duties not then already vested in the 
various offices and officials of the Department of Labor. Section 3 limits the 
powers of reorganization by the Commission to the offices, bureaus and 
instrumentalities of the Executive Branch of the Government only. So that it was 
not the intention of Congress, in enacting Republic Act No. 997, to authorize 
the transfer of powers and jurisdiction granted to the courts of justice from 
these to the officials to be appointed or offices to be created by the 
Reorganization Plan. Congress is well aware of the provisions of the 
Constitution that judicial powers are vested 'only in the Supreme Court and in 
such courts as the law may establish'. The Commission was not authorised to 
create courts of justice, or to take away from these their jurisdiction and 
transfer said jurisdiction to the officials appointed or offices created under 
the Reorganization Plan. The Legislature may not and cannot delegate its power 
to legislate or create courts of justice to any other agency of the Government

Off. Gaz., 5466; Surigao Consolidated vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, 94 
Phil., 492; 50 Off. Gaz., 1018; U.S. vs. Shreveport, 287 U.S. 77, 77 L. Ed. 175 
and Johnson vs. San Diego, 42 B. 249).</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *<br> </p>
<p>In consequence, we are constrained to hold and declare the provision of 
Reorganization Plan No. 20-A, particularly Section 25, which grants to the 
regional offices original and exclusive jurisdiction over money claims of 
laborers, is null and void, said grant having been made without authority by 
Republic Act No. 997. * * *"</p>
