<p class="BODY">It appears that on or about <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1965</st1:date>, the Bank filed, with the Office of the
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, a petition (Annex 1) for the extrajudicial
foreclosure of said mortgages to satisfy an indebtedness of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ricom</span>, Inc., allegedly aggregating P574,401.08, as of
<st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the sheriff caused to be given and
published the corresponding notice of extrajudicial sale of the fourteen (14)
lots aforementioned to take place on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1965</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1965</st1:date>,
herein petitioners filed Civil Case No. 4716 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> against the Bank and <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canoy</span>, as Deputy Sheriff of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging that, although "the obligation
to pay the mortgage debt aforementioned does not fix a period, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> from the nature and
circumstances it can be inferred that a period was intended," petitioners
prayed in their complaint, Annex 2, that judgment be rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"fixing a period within which" they
"should comply with their obligation to pay the" Bank and declaring
that such obligation is "not yet due and demandable," and that,
meanwhile, a writ of preliminary injunction issue restraining the Bank and the
sheriff "from proceeding with the extrajudicial foreclosure and the sale
of the mortgaged properties." Thereupon, or on June 16, 1965, said court -
then presided over by Hon. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bullecer</span> - issued <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> the auxiliary writ prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="6">June
 25, 1965</st1:date>, the Bank moved to dissolve said writ, but the lower court
denied it.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Meanwhile, petitioners had amended the complaint and prayed therein for a
declaration of extinction of the guaranty and discharge of the mortgage, upon
the theory that the Bank had granted the <span class="SpellE">Ricorn</span> extensions
of time for the payment of its debt, without petitioners' consent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 25, 1966, petitioners filed a second amended complaint
in which they averred, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that
the deeds of mortgage Annexes B and C are null and void, because of the provisions
therein renouncing the right of redemption, in the event of foreclosure, and
constituting the Bank, in case of default in the payment of the obligation, as
petitioners' attorney-in-fact, with authority to take possession of the
mortgaged properties and to sell and dispose of the same, which were allegedly
beyond the powers of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>,
Jr., as petitioners' attorney-in-fact, and that, when they made him their
attorney-in-fact, petitioners agreed that they would "only be bound as guarantors
and not as <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors and x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> were assured by x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>, Jr. and the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Bank that, in case of default, the properties of the
principal debtor would be exhausted first before proceeding with the
foreclosure x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,"
and praying that judgment be rendered declaring that the real estate mortgages
in question are "null and void for having been made beyond the scope of
the agent's authority"; that the relation of the petitioners with the Bank
is "that of guarantors"; that "the guaranty is already
extinguished, or in the remote hypothesis that it is not" that "the
projected extrajudicial foreclosure" is "illegal," because
"said real estate mortgages are null and void and/or that"
petitioners "as guarantors have in their favor the benefit of <span class="SpellE">excussion</span>" and/or that petitioners "had not yet
been in default."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer to the second amended complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>
the Bank alleged that <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> had not in fact
waived the mortgagor's right of redemption, and that the power of attorney
given to <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>, Jr. included, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, renewals and extensions of payment; and denied
the alleged agreement either to make the petitioners mere guarantors or to
grant them the right of <span class="SpellE">excussion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of special defenses, the Bank averred
that petitioners have no cause of action; that the extra-judicial foreclosure
in question is in accordance with Act No. 3135 as amended by Act No. 4118; that
the alleged nullity of the waiver of petitioners' right of redemption does not
affect the validity of the mortgage as security for the payment of the
principal obligation; that the right of <span class="SpellE">excussion</span> is
not available when a mortgage is constituted as special security for the
payment of a principal obligation; that petitioners have acted in bad faith in
not including <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>,
Jr., whose acts are being contested in this case, as a party therein; and that
the loan constituting the principal obligation was obtained through
petitioners' own corporation, the <span class="SpellE">Ricorn</span>, of which
they are all the principal stockholders and directors. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The Bank, likewise, set up a counterclaim for
damages, attorney's fees and actual expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1966</st1:date>,
the Bank asked once again that the writ of preliminary injunction issued on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1965</st1:date>, be lifted.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>
After considering petitioners' opposition thereto, and the evidence introduced
at the trial on the merits, which was held on July 19, 1966, the lower court,
presided over by respondent Judge, issued, on August 3, 1966, an order<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
dissolving said writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration
of this order having been denied, on August 27,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> petitioners commenced the present
action, on <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior thereto, or on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1966</st1:date>, respondent Judge had, however,
rendered a decision<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>
on the merits of Case No. 4716, dismissing petitioners' complaint therein,
subject to the qualification that they have the right of redemption granted by
law to mortgagors whose properties are foreclosed <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of said decision was, on September 2,
1966, served upon petitioners' counsel, who filed, on September 20, 1966, their
notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal, the approval of which has
been, however, held in abeyance owing to the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the case at bar (?).<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that, in issuing said order of <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1966</st1:date> and refusing to
reconsider the same, "respondent Judge committed a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction," because:</p>

<p class="NUM">a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>
had exceeded his authority in waiving petitioners' right to redeem their
properties in the event of extra-judicial foreclosure thereof; in appointing
the president of respondent Bank as petitioners' attorney-in-fact, with full
power of substitution, and the authority to enter upon and take possession of
the mortgaged properties without the order of any court or any authority other
than that granted in the deeds of mortgage, as well as to sell and dispose of
said properties to the highest bidder; and in stipulating in paragraph 12 of
said deeds of mortgage that:</p>

<blockquote>"All correspondence relative to this mortgage, including
demand letters, summonses, subpoenas, or notifications of any judicial or
extra-judicial action shall be sent to the Mortgagor at 167 <span class="SpellE">Monteverde</span>,
Sta. Ana, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, or at the address that may
hereafter be given in writing by the Mortgagor to the Mortgagee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere act of sending any correspondence by
mail or by personal delivery to the said address shall be valid and effective
notice to the Mortgagor for all legal purposes, and the fact that any
communication is not actually received by the Mortgagor or that it has been
returned unclaimed to the Mortgagee, or that no person was found at the address
given or that the address is fictitious or cannot be located, shall not excuse
or relieve the Mortgagor from the effects of such notice."</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whatever damages the Bank may suffer by reason

<p class="BODY">We note that the writ of preliminary injunction issued on June
16, 1965, was dissolved by an order of August 3, 1966, or two (2) weeks after
Civil Case No. 4716 had been heard on the merits, on July 19, 1966, and that,
in issuing said order, respondent Judge had taken into consideration the
evidence then introduced - as well as the Bank's motion for the dissolution of
the writ and petitioners' opposition thereto. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In fact, four (4) weeks later, or on August
31, 1966, respondent Judge rendered his decision dismissing petitioners'
complaint in Case No. 4716 - with the qualification already adverted to - upon
the ground, in effect, of lack of cause of action on the part of petitioners
herein, inasmuch as:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 1.05in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The deeds of mortgage executed by <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>, Jr. on
behalf and in the name of petitioners herein are valid and binding upon
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waiver of their right of
redemption, even if it were illegal did not affect the validity of the mortgage
constituted in favor of the Bank, not being an essential element thereof, apart
from the fact that, despite said waiver, petitioners' right of redemption is
acknowledged by the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
alleged lack of authority of <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>, Jr. to agree
on some other minor stipulations in said at mortgage was cured by the
power-of-attorney, Annex D, <u>ratifying</u> the deed of mortgage, Annex C,
which, insofar as the afore mentioned waiver and stipulations are concerned, is
identical to the first deed of mortgage, Annex B.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 1.05in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The testimonial evidence for the petitioners,
concerning the alleged "personal" character of their guaranty and the
right of <span class="SpellE">excussion</span> they claim to have, are unworthy
of credence, because: (a) they are inconsistent with the clear tenor and the
nature of the deeds of mortgage Annexes B and C; (b) petitioners' contention is
based upon assurances allegedly given by <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span>,
who did not represent the Bank, and by mere appraisers of the latter, who could
neither give such assurances nor bind the Bank thereby; (c) had petitioners
really labored under the impression that they were no more than personal
guarantors who were entitled to <span class="SpellE">excussion</span>, they would
have said so in their original complaint and their first amended complaint,
instead of merely asking that <u>a period be fixed for the payment of their
obligation</u> under said deeds of mortgage, thereby admitting impliedly, but
necessarily, that the Bank had a real right over the mortgaged properties and
was not bound to make said <span class="SpellE">excussion</span>; (d) failure to
include <span class="SpellE">Calinawan</span> among the defendants in Case No.
4716 is strongly indicative of the infirmity of petitioners' theory; and (e)
the principal obligation guaranteed by the mortgage inured to the benefit of <span class="SpellE">Ricorn</span>, a corporation of which petitioners - except <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> Garcia, and <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, who is, however, related by affinity to the other
petitioners - are stockholders and some are even directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the decision in Case No. 4716 is not before this
Court for review on appeal; that the records before Us do not show, and
petitioners herein do not even claim, that the foregoing findings contained in
said decision are not substantially supported by the evidence; that said
findings amply justify the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction,
issued on June 16, 1965; and that, although they could not be and were not
explicitly made in the order of August 3,1966, lifting the injunction - those
findings being proper for a decision on the merits, which was promulgated four
(4) weeks later - the tenor of the order clearly indicates that, in issuing the
same, respondent judge had the aforementioned findings in mind, We are of the
opinion and so hold that the dissolution of the injunction was not attended by
a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and
that, patently, petitioners herein are not entitled to the relief prayed for.</p>
