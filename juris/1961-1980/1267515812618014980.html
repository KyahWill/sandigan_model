<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner Go <span class="SpellE">Kem</span> Lim, alias William Co, single, born in the Philippines 
of Chinese parents on May 7, 1939, "filed a declaration of intention to apply 
for Filipino citizenship on March 24, 1960. Subsequently, or on May 3, 1961, he 
filed his petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Notices of the petition were duly 
published and posted. At the hearing<span class="GramE">:,</span> on January 15, 
1962 and March 3, 1962, petitioner and his two character witnesses testified as 
follows :<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ricardo Villanueva, 68, married, 
resident of <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, said that he is a Filipino citizen and 
incumbent mayor of <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>; that he has personally 
known petitioner since the latter's birth in 1939 in <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>; that petitioner has resided in <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span> continuously from birth to the present; that he 
personally knows that petitioner is a person of good repute, morally 
irreproachable, attached to the principles of the Philippine Constitution and 
disposed to the good order and happiness of the Philippines; that in his opinion 
petitioner has all the qualifications, and is not disqualified, to become a 
Filipino citizen; that he agrees to petitioner's naturalization because he is a 
"very good man and a law abiding citizen and is very cooperative for the 
improvements of the municipality".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ramon Villanueva, 62, married, 
resident of <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental stated that he is a Filipino citizen and 
municipal secretary of <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>; that since 
petitioner's birth, in <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>, he knew him because 
petitioner was reared therein and because he was well-acquainted with 
petitioner's mother and is, in fact, the godfather of petitioner's sister; that 
in his opinion petitioner is of good repute, morally irreproachable, attached to 
the principles underlying the Constitution and well disposed to the good order 
and happiness of the Philippines, and has mil the qualifications and no <span class="GramE">disqualification</span> for naturalization; and that petitioner is 
"very cooperative to both social and civic undertakings of the government" and 
was in fÂ»ct recently appointed treasurer of the Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Centenary Celebration of their 
municipality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner testified, <i>inter 
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>, that he has resided in <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span> since birth except during the time he was studying 
at <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>; that 
he is a storekeeper of Go Kung Commercial, owned by his uncle, with a salary of 
P300.00 per month, as shown in his income tax return for 1960 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B.); that he is a shareholder in the amount of 
P2,700.00 in the Lim <span class="SpellE">Feng</span> business firm; that he 
speaks and writes English and <span class="SpellE">Cebu-Visayan</span>; that he 
believes in the principle underlying the Philippine Constitution; that he has 
conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire 
residence in the Philippines in his relations with the constituted authorities 
as well as with the community he lives in; that he has mingled freely with 
Filipinos in their social functions and has evinced a sincere desire to adopt or 
embrace the customs and ideals of the Filipinos; that some instances of his 
social <span class="SpellE">minglng</span> with Filipinos are "during fiesta and 
in one of the celebrations of the Philippines, I was appointed as Treasurer of 
the Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Centenary 
Celebration".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore, on 
cross-examination, petitioner stated that he studied at the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Chinese High School around four years, "grades 3 to 5 
then for the 4th year"; that he is not supporting his mother, although a 
deduction of <span class="GramE">P1 ,000.00</span> in regard to his mother was 
claimed in his income tax return for 1960. Reiterating that he believes in the 
<span class="GramE">principle that underlie</span> the Philippine Constitution, he 
could not, however, mention one of them. Asked to mention some of the Filipino 
customs, he replied: "We eat three times a day". Asked what else, he added: 
"During fiesta celebrate".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In his re-direct testimony 
petitioner said that while he is no longer supporting his mother, he did so in 
1960, the year the tax deduction was claimed for; and that, at any rate, he paid 
P46.00 as income tax per official receipt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-l), 
that is, more than the tax due even if the deduction <span class="GramE">were</span> disallowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Republic presented no 
evidence but submitted, on March 12, 1962, a memorandum opposing petitioner's 
naturalization. Petitioner in turn filed his memorandum on March 17, 
1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 28, 1962, the Court of 
First Instance rendered its decision granting Filipino citizenship to 
petitioner. The Republic thereupon appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">First, appellant contends that 
petitioner has not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner 
during the entire period of his residence in his relation with the constituted 
government, as required by Sec. 2, par. 3, of the Naturalization Law. In support 
thereof it is argued that petitioner made a false income tax return by claiming 
a deduction of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for his mother although he is 
not supporting her. The record shows that during the trial in 1962, petitioner 
stated he <i>is</i> not supporting his mother; nonetheless, he later explained 
that in 1960 he <i>was</i> supporting her and this was not rebutted. 
Furthermore, petitioner admittedly paid sufficient income tax for 1960 even 
disallowing the aforesaid deduction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant also points out that 
petitioner's Alien Certificate of Registration was not presented. Petitioner, 
however, adduced his Native Born Certificate of Registration (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F). Furthermore, the presentation of the Alien 
Certificate of Registration is required only upon demand by the authorities, 
which was not made herein (Sec. 7, RA 562 as amended by Sec. 3, RA 751). Roth of 
the instances cited, therefore, <span class="GramE">are</span> not prejudicial to 
petitioner's application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Secondly, appellant maintains 
that petitioner has not proven his belief in the principles underlying the 
Constitution. We find merit in this contention. For while petitioner repeatedly 
claimed to hold such beliefs, he could not even mention a single one of the 
principles he allegedly believed in. It is now argued on his behalf that he has 
shown such beliefs in action rather than in words. Specifically, by helping his 
mother in spending for his brother's education, he is paid to have believed in 
the principle that "the natural right and duty of parents in the rearing of the 
youth for civic efficiency should receive the aid and support of the Government" 
(Sec. 4, Art. II); and his participation in civic and community projects is said 
to have shown belief in the principle that "the Philippines renounces war as an 
instrument of national policy, and adopts the generally accepted principles of 
international Jaw as part of the law of the Nation" (Sec. 3, Art II). We see no 
necessary relation between petitioner's actuations and the principles 
abovementioned. Such actions could just as readily be taken for reasons foreign 
to or independent from the Philippine Constitution and the principle underlying 
it. For action to indicate belief in the principles underlying the Constitution, 
the same must be <span class="GramE">so</span> conclusively attributable to said 
principles as to convince the Court that they spring from a belief in 
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, on appeal in 
naturalization cases the entire record is open to scrutiny whether objection is 
made or not (Kwan <span class="SpellE">Kwock</span> How <i>vs</i>. Republic, 
L-18521, Jan. 30, 1964; <span class="SpellE">Tio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Chai</span> <i>vs</i>. Republic, 
L-19112, Oct. 30, 1964). We may therefore add that petitioner's evidence is 
fatally defective on two other counts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner, while resident of 
<span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span> since birth, has not continuously resided 
therein; a good portion of his time was admittedly spent in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> where he studied at the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
Chinese High School. Since his two character witnesses, Ricardo Villanueva and 
Ramon Villanueva, only claim to be both residents of <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>, they cannot, as such, qualify to attest to his 
good conduct and irreproachable character during the entire period of his 
residence in the Philippines (De Lara vs. Republic, L-18203, May 29, 
1964).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner's evidence on his 
social mingling with Filipinos consists in general statements that he cooperates 
in social a civic undertakings, mixes with Filipinos "during fiesta", and the 
specific instance of his having been appointed treasurer of the Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Centenary Celebration of <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span> on December 30, 1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Social mingling, as this Court 
has said in Chua vs. Republic, L-19776, Sept. 29. 1964, means that "an applicant 
must deal with and receive Filipinos in his home, and visit Filipino homes in a 
spirit of friendliness and equality, without any discrimination." It was therein 
pointed out that this must be shown not by general statements but by "concrete 
instances (with dates, places and names)" to satisfy the Court that 
disqualification under Sec. 4(f) of the Naturalization Law does not exist Said 
social mingling, furthermore, must have taken place "during the entire period of 
the applicant's residence in the Philippines in order to preclude any temporary 
sporadic social intercourse set up for naturalization 
purposes".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Far from showing the foregoing, 
petitioner stated that he studied and finished high school in the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Chinese School where Filipinos are not allowed to 
enroll (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., Jan. 15, 1962, p. 20). Neither can it be 
said that petitioner has evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace the 
customs, traditions and ideals of our people, inasmuch as when asked to mention 
a Filipino custom his first reply was: "We eat three times a 
day".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
hereby reversed and the petition denied, with costs against petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">It is
