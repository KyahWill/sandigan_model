				<H3>PANGASINAN TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. (PANTRANCO), PETITIONER,
VS. HONORABLE NICASIO A. YATCO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF
FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, BRANCH V (QUEZON CITY) AND ELPIDIO O. DIZON, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original action for prohibition with preliminary
injunction, to restrain respondent, Honorable <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, then Judge of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch V, from proceeding with the hearing
of Civil Case No. 7237- Q thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon after the filing of the petition herein, we issued the writ
of preliminary injunction prayed for, upon the submission and approval of the
requisite bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On November 6, 1962, resÂ­pondent <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> boarded bus No. 635 of petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation Co., Inc. - hereinafter referred
to as <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> - as a paying passenger bound for <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
the vehicle was cruising along the national highway, in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Apalit</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, it collided with a La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca-Pambusco</span>
truck, in consequence of which <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and four (4)
other passengers of said <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> Bus No. 635,
suffered serious physical injuries, which caused the death of one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
had refused to heed his demands for the payment of damages, on or about April
30, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a complaint - which was docketed as Civil
Case No. 7237 of said Court - against the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>,
for the recovery of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
submitting its answer, with a counterclaim for P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
dated May 27, 1963, the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> filed a third-party
complaint against La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca-Pambusco</span> and its driver
Benjamin Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his complaint, as well as in his amended complaint in said
case, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> alleged that he was a resident of No. 140
<span class="SpellE">Talayan</span> Road, San Francisco del Monte, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on June 1, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> testified, however, that he was a resident of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, he being merely taking a vacation in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> moved to dismiss the
complaint upon the ground of improper venue, but, the then presiding Judge of
the Lower court, Honorable <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, one of the respondents herein, denied the
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the conclusion of the
evidence for <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, as plaintiff in the case for
damages, the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> proceeded to introduce its own
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the completion thereof,
it, however, commence the present action for prohibition, in the Supreme Court,
to restrain the lower court from proceeding with the hearing of the case, upon
the theory that venue had been improperly laid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition herein is untenable, not so much because the
objection to venue is deemed waived, when, as in the present case, it is not
set up before the filing of the answer in the lower court,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as because the filing of <span class="SpellE">Pantranco's</span> counterclaim in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and, later, of <span class="SpellE">Pantranco's</span> third-party complaint against the La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca-Pambusco</span>, necessarily implied a submission to the
jurisdiction of said court, and, accordingly, a waiver of such right as the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> may have had to object to the venue, upon the
ground that it had been improperly laid.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The introduction of part of the evidence for the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
after the denial of its motion to dismiss and before the institution of the
present case tended, also, to have the same effect.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition herein should be, as it is hereby
dismissed, the writ prayed for denied and the writ of preliminary injunction
heretofore issued, dissolved, with costs against the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>.</p>
