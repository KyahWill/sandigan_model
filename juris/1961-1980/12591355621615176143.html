				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Claim for death benefits. Claimant is respondent Sofia Reyes Florzo.
Deceased was her son, Ricardo Florzo. Employer of the deceased was
petitioner Itemcop. The Workmen's Compensation Commission ordered
Itemcop to pay claimant P2,296.32 as compensation benefit, P60.00 for
medical, and P200.00 for burial, expenses, and P172.22 as attorneys'
fees. Itemcop was further ordered to pay P23.00 for the Workmen's
Compensation Fund and P5.00 for review fee. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>Itemcop appealed.
<p>Ricardo Florzo was Itemcop's employee for a little less than 4 years up to March 20, 1960 when he died at the age of 25.</p>
<p>He was a beam carrier. Primarily, his job was to replace empty loom
beams attached to weaving machines with fully loaded ones. An empty
beam weighs from 15 to 30 kilos. During an 8-hour period, about 20 to
30 beams are substituted on a total of 406 machines. Ricardo worked 8
hours a day, 6 days a week.</p>
<p>Florzo fell ill on March 5, 1960. He did not report for work. Dr.
Alfonso Ayesa, Itemcop physician, diagnosed his ailment to be
"Thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic". This means a diminution of
blood cells. "Idiopathic" signifies that the cause of the disease is
unknown. Later on the deceased was discovered to be suffering from
"cerebral hemorrhage, secondary to blood dyscracia; anemia, secondary
to hemorrhage, secondary to blood dyscracia".</p>
<p>On March 14, 1960, half of Florzo's body became paralyzed. He was
taken to the Lourdes Hospital. Six days later, i. e., on March 20,
1960, as aforesaid, he died. The autopsy on Florzo's body was conducted
by Dr. Pedro P. Solis, supervisor, medico-legal office, National Bureau
of Investigation. Cause of death, according to the medico-legal
necropsy report, is - "anemia, severe, secondary to hemorrhagic gastric
ulcer".</p>
<p>On May 3, 1961, respondent Sofia Reyes Florzo lodged with Regional
Office No. 4, Department of Labor, notice of injury and claim for
compensation. Thereafter, Itemcop filed the employer's report of
accident or sickness and the physician's report of sickness or
accident, both dated May 23, 1961.</p>
<p>1. Petitioner Itemcop takes the position that the Director of
Workmen's Compensation cannot exercise jurisdiction to review and
decide compensation cases on appeal from regional offices. Its reason
is that the authority granted said director under Reorganization Plan
20-A clashes with Section 46 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, which
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œSEC. 46. <em>Jurisdiction</em>. - The Workmen's
Compensation Commissioner shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
decide claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act,
subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, in the same manner and in the
same period as provided by law and by rules of court for appeal from
the court of Industrial Relations to the Supreme Court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to Reorganization Plan 20-A, the Director of Workmen's
Compensation is member and ex-oficio chairman of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission. Plan 20-A, in turn, was adopted by the
Government Survey and Reorganization Commission organized by authority
of Republic Act 997, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> as amended by Republic Act 1241. Said Republic Act 997, as thus amended, granted to said commission the following powers:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1) to group, coordinate or consolidate departments bureaus, offices, agencies, instrumentalities and functions of government;</p>
  <p>(2)
to <span style="font-style: italic;">abolish</span> departments, offices, agencies, or functions which may not
be necessary or <span style="font-style: italic;">create</span> those which may be necessary for the efficient
conduct of the government service, activities and functions;</p>
  <p>(3) to eliminate overlapping and complication of service, activities and functions of the government;</p>
  <p>(4)
to <span style="font-style: italic;">transfer</span> functions, appropriations, equipment, property, records and
personnel, from one department, bureau, office, agency or
instrumentality to another;</p>
  <p>(5) to <span style="font-style: italic;">create, classify, combine, split</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">abolish</span> positions;</p>
  <p>(6) to standardize salaries, materials and equipment; and</p>
  <p>(7) to do whatever is necessary and desirable to effect economy and <span style="font-style: italic;">promote efficiency</span> in the government;" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clear then is the grant by Congress to the Government Survey and
Reorganization Commission the authority to abolish, create, and
<span style="font-style: italic;">transfer functions</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">positions</span>. The authorization thus granted by
Congress is valid. In comparable situation, the authority given the
President of the Philippines "to make reforms and changes in
government-controlled corporations" was sustained-as not "an undue
delegation of legislative power". <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
<p>Here is the situation now before us. Instead of one Commissioner (with a Deputy <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to take his place), three commissioners were created under the plan. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
The powers of the commissioner under Section 46 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act and those of the three commissioners under the
Reorganization Plan are the same. There was merely a reallocation of
"powers already possessed". There was "no assumption of powers not
previously vested". There was no violation of the specific authority
given the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission and Republic
Act 997. We therefore rule that the authority of the Director of
Workmen's Compensation, as ex-oficio chairman of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, to decide appealed cases brought up from
regional offices is valid and binding. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p>
<p>2. Planted upon Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, is
petitioner's averment that both the notice of sickness and the claim
for compensation were filed beyond the statutory limits. Because death
occurred on March 20, 1960, whereas said notice and claim were lodged
on May 3, 1961. And Section 24 requires that such notice be made as
soon as possible and said claim be filed in three months following
death.</p>
<p>The issue raised offers no area for genuine dispute. The recorded
facts constitute a roadblock to petitioner's claim. <span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, petitioner
had actual knowledge of the sickness and death. This fact is admitted
in its employer's report of injury or sickness dated May 23, 1961. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
There, the date of sickness was placed as March 4, 1960, the date of
disability as March 5, 1960, the date of actual knowledge of such
sickness by petitioner, March 5, 1960, and the date of death as March
20, 1960. By explicit articulation in Section 27 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, "Failure to [give], or delay in giving notice shall
not be a bar to the proceeding x x x if it is shown that the employer,
his agent or representative had knowledge of the accident x x x". <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, petitioner failed to file its employer's report of injury or
sickness under Section 37 of the Workmen's Compensation Act "as soon as
possible after the occurrence of an injury resulting in absence from
work for a day or more" or soon after the death of the employee.
Neither did it controvert - under Section 45 of the said Act - the
right to compensation by reason of such death "on or before the
fourteenth day after disability or within ten days after he has
knowledge of the alleged accident". Said petitioner only challenged the
right to compensation <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> respondent mother of the deceased filed her
claim for compensation. Guilty itself of laches - and to a greater
degree - petitioner cannot be heard now to set up the laches of the
other party as a defense to the latter's claim for compensation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
Indeed, petitioner's failure to so controvert, without giving any cause
or reason therefor, by the terms of the statute, constitutes "a
renunciation of his right" to challenge the claim. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
<p>3. Is employee Florzo's death compensable? Florzo suffered bleeding
in the stomach. Dr. Pedro P. Solis explained that "even if the stomach
is not empty, the frequent stress brought about by lifting heavy
objects x x x might produce an ulcer in the stomach, and this is known
in medicine as stress ulcer". Further, the effect of continuous work on
a person with a stomach ulcer, so Dr. Solis added, is that "It will
aggravate the diseased condition of the stomach, and most likely, it
may produce hemorrhage which could be 'uncontrollable, or
controllableâ€™". <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> There
is then reason to believe, as the Commission observes, that "the
continuous exertion of carrying heavy beams during his (deceased's)
employment gradually, if imperceptibly, resulted to his illness causing
paralyzation of half of his body and ultimately his death". <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p>
<p>At any rate, the law presumes, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that the claim is compensable. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The burden to disconnect, by substantial evidence, the injury or sickness from employment, is laid at the employer's door. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
Petitioner failed to discharge this burden. So rigid is the rule that
even where the cause of the employee's death is unknown - as petitioner
claims - the right to compensation subsists. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
Reason for this is that the Workmen's Compensation Act is a social
legislation; it is designed to give relief to the workman; therefore,
to effectuate its purpose, it must be liberally construed. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p>
<p>Conformably to the foregoing, we vote to affirm the judgment under review. Costs against petitioner.</p>
