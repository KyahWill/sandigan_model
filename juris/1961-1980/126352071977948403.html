the proceedings had in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>

<p class="BODY">Under the provisions of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
second para­graph of Section <span style="">2 </span>of
Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, the municipal judge of the provincial capital

petition or request with said Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;

effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is within the discretion of
the Judge of the Court of First Instance to grant, or not to grant, such
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of <span style="">course, the order of the Court of First Instance must be predicated </span>upon
<span style="">the existence </span>of an information
or criminal complaint charging the commission of an offense that had taken

that the offense was committed in a municipality where there <span style="">is </span>no incumbent municipal judge (and
there is no auxiliary municipal judge), or for some valid reason the <span style="">municipal judge can not act on the case and
the municipal mayor does not want to conduct </span>the preliminary examination
himself; or the circumstance may be that the witnesses for the prosecution are
afraid, or refuse, to testify if the preliminary examination and investigation
is held in the municipal court of the municipality where the offense was
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under those circumstances the
complaint or information may be filed in the municipal court of the

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">the case </span>now
before <span style="">Us, </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontano</span> addressed a
letter to Hon. <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Solis, the executive judge
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, requesting that the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> be authorized to conduct the preliminary examination
and investigation of the crime of double murder and double frustrated murder
which <span style="">was </span>committed
in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bantay</span> on November 9, 1965, of
which her husband was one of the victims, alleging <span style="">as </span>ground for said request the circumstance
that the witnesses that she intended to present were afraid to testify in the
municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Bantay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fontano</span>
attached to her letter copies of the criminal complaint which she had signed
and the sworn statements of witnesses supporting the criminal complaint, the
original of which documents were to be filed in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> if the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>
were authorized to conduct the preliminary <span style="">examination and investigation </span>as requested by her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge Solis found the request of
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fontano</span> meritorious, and forthwith he issued an
order which "ordered and authorized" the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> to conduct the preliminary investiga­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having with her the order of Judge Solis,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fontano</span> filed with the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> the originals of the criminal complaint and the
supporting affidavits of witnesses, copies of which she had attached to her
letter-request to the executive judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also filed with the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> a copy of her letter-request to the executive judge
and a copy of the order of Judge Solis authorizing the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> to conduct the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Res­</span>pondent
Judge <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> accepted
the criminal complaint filed by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fontano</span> and the
documents accompanying it, but he did not docket the case right then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting pursuant to the authority granted him
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> set the
preliminary examination of the case for <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1966</st1:date> Judge <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> examined witnesses Modesto Paz and Jose <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> on their sworn statements attached to the criminal
complaint, and those witnesses affirmed and swore to their statements before
Judge <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, and their testimonies before Judge <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> were taken down by the municipal court stenographer in
the form of questions and answers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having satisfied himself, after examining the witnesses, that there was
sufficient evidence to establish that the crime complained of had been
committed and that the accused named in the criminal complaint had probably
committed the crime, Judge <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> ordered the issuance
of the warrant <span style="">of </span>arrest for the
apprehension of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, two warrants of arrest were issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The criminal complaint was then docketed as
Criminal Case No. 3109 of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span>
Solis had acted in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of Section
2 of Rule 112 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>He had properly authorized, and
clothed with jurisdiction, the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>
to conduct the preliminary examination and investigation of the criminal case
against <span style="">herein petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, We find that respondent Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, in conducting the preliminary examination and in
ordering the issuance of the warrants of arrest, had acted in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 112 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the accused, who
are the petitioners herein, were not given a chance to be present at the
preliminary examination did not affect the validity of the proceedings had
before respondent municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
section 5 of Rule 112 of the Rules of Court the municipal judge who conducts
the preliminary examination must take under oath, either in the presence or
absence of the accused, the testimonies of the witnesses for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused has no
constitutional right to be present during the preliminary examination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition for prohibition is
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order issued

'investigation' should be understood to mean 'and', because the municipal

stages of the preliminary investigation -- the first stage, consisting of the
preliminary examination <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. </span>4, 5, and 6 of <span style="">Rule </span>112), and the second stage,
