				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a companion case to G. R. No. L-23794, <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Co., Inc. vs. Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
City, et al., wherein this Court holds, through Associate Justice Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, that Ordinance No. 4, Series of 1964, enacted by
the Municipal Board of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, is
unconstitutional and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of the said ordinance provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Municipal Tax.- There shall be paid to the City Treasurer on
any and all produc­tions of centrifugal sugar milled at the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
Sugar Company, Incorporated, in <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City a
municipal tax equivalent to one <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">percentum</span></span>
(%) per export sale to the United States of America and other foreign
countries."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G. R. No.</span> L-23794 suit was brought by
the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Co., Inc., to seek a refund of the
sum of P12<span class="GramE">,087.50</span> which it had paid under protest in
1964 pursuant to the ordinance in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision in said case holds that the ordinance imposes a tax on
export, and that it infringes the equal protection clause of the constitution,
since it refers exclusively in the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar
Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand the instant case is a petition for declaratory
judgment filed by <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugarcane Planters
Association Inc., rights of whose members ale also affected by the
ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other relief than
declaration of its nullity is prayed for, and the same must be granted in
accordance with and for the reason already set forth in the other case.</p>

<p class="BODY">For purposes of our decision herein, however one other ground may
be cited, namely, that the taxing power granted to chartered cities, municipalities
and municipal districts in Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2264 (June 19, 1959)
was amended on June 19, 1965 by R.A. No. 4497, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section two of Republic Act <span class="GramE">Numbered</span> Twenty-two hundred sixty-four is amended to read as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 2.</span> Taxation.- Any provision
of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all chartered cities, municipalities
and municipal districts shall have authority to impose municipal license taxes
or fees upon persons engaged in any occupation or business, or exercising
privileges in chartered cities, municipalities or municipal districts by
requiring them to secure licenses at rates fixed by the municipal board or city
council of the city, the municipal council of the municipality, or the
municipal district coun­cil of the municipal district; to collect fees and
charges for service rendered by the city, municipality or municipal district;
to regulate and impose reason­able fees for services rendered in con­nection
with any business, profession or occupation being conducted within the city,
municipality or municipal district and otherwise to levy for public purposes,
just and uniform taxes, licenses or fees:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, That municipalities and municipal districts shall, in no case,
impose any percentage tax on sales or other taxes in any form based thereon nor
impose taxes on articles subject to specific tax, except gasoline, under the
provisions of the National Internal Revenue code:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That no city, municipality
or municipal district may levy or impose any of the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">Taxes</span>, fees, or
levies, of any kind, which in effect impose e burden on exports of Philippine
finished, manufactured or processed products and products of Philippine cottage
industries."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Subsection 1 of section 1 just quoted did not exist in R.A. No.
2264 before it was amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amendment is clearly a denial of the power to impose export taxes, and in
effect repeals the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> ordinance subject of this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b> the said ordinance is hereby declared
unconstitutional and void, and no longer of any effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
