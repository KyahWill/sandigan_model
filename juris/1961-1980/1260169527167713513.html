				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Mandamus case filed by petitioner Marcelino Buyco praying that the Respondent 
Philippine National Bank be compelled to accept his backpay acknowledgment 
certificate No. 4801, as payment of his obligation with said respondent.
<p>The case was submitted on an agreed stipulation of facts, with the pertinent 
documents as annexes.</p>
<p>On April 24, 1956, petitioner Marcelino Buyco was indebted to respondent in 
the amount of P5,102.90 plus interest thereon, which represented petitioner's 
deficit on his 1952-53 crop loan with respondent bank. The said loan was secured 
by a mortgage of real property. Petitioner is a holder of Backpay Acknowledgment 
Certificate No. 4801, dated July 9, 1955 , under Rep. Act No. 897 in the amount 
of P22,227.69 payable in thirty (30) years. On April 24, 1956, petitioner 
offered to pay respondent bank the deficit of his crop loan for the above 
mentioned crop year 1952-53 with his said backpay acknowledgment certificate, 
but on July 18, 1956, respondent answered petitioner that since respondent's 
motion for reconsideration in the case of Marcelino B. Florentino <em>vs</em>. 
Philippine National Bank (98 Phil., 959; 52 Off. Gaz., [5] 2522) was still under 
consideration by this Court (S. C.), respondent "cannot yet grant" petitioner's 
request (Annex A, amended petition). On February 15, 1957 , and after this Court 
has denied respondent's motion for reconsideration in said case No. L-8782, 
petitioner, again wrote respondent, reiterating his request to pay the 
obligation with said certificate (Annex B). On February 19, 1957 , respondent 
answered petitioner that in view of the amendment of its charter on June 16, 
1956 by R. A. No. 1576, it could not accept petitioners' certificate (Annex C). 
Petitioner requested respondent to reconsider its decision, in a letter dated 
March 26, 1957 (Annex D), which was referred to the respondent's Legal 
Department. In an opinion rendered on April 23, 1957 , said department expressed 
the view that notwithstanding the decision of this Court, the respondent could 
not accept the certificate because of the amendment of its Charter heretofore 
mentioned.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of Iloilo, on July 24, 1958, granted the petition 
and ordered the respondent bank "to give due course of the vested right of the 
petitioner acquired previous to the enactment of Republic Act No. 1576 by 
accepting his backpay acknowledgment certificate as payment of the obligation of 
the petitioner with respondent Bank with costs of the proceedings against 
respondent". Hence, this appeal by the respondent Bank.</p>
<p>In spousing the cause of the petitioner-appellee, the trial court made the 
following findings and conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) That in the letter Annex A, dated July 18, 1956, the respondent has 
<em>impliedly admitted</em> the right of petitioner to apply or offer his 
certificate in payment of his obligation to respondent.</p>
<p>(2) That the pendency of the motion for reconsideration of the Florentino 
case filed by respondent-appellant, did not affect the petitioner's vested right 
already created and acquired at the time he offered to pay his obligation with 
his certificate on April 24, 1956, and before the passage of Rep. Act No. 
1576.</p>
<p>(3) That Rep. Act No. 1576 does not nullify the right of the petitioner to 
pay his obligation with his backpay certificate.</p>
<p>(4) That the writ of mandamus would lie against the 
appellant.</p></blockquote>
<p>The above findings and conclusions are assigned as errors, alleged to have 
been committed by the trial court.</p>
<p>In the light of the Supreme Court's decision in the Florentino case, the 
respondent Philippine National Bank therein, was declared authorized to accept 
backpay acknowledgement certificate as payment of the obligation of any holder 
thereof. Although the Florentino case was promulgated on April 28, 1956, four 
(4) days after April 24, 1956, the date the appellee offered to pay with his 
backpay acknowledgment certificate, it is nevertheless obvious that on or before 
said April 24, 1956, the right to have his certificate applied for the payment 
of his obligation with the appellant already existed by virtue of Republic Act 
No. 897, which was merely construed and clarified by this Court in the said 
Florentino case. So that when the appellant in its letter of July 18, 1956, 
replied that "in the meantime that our motion for reconsideration of the said 
decision is still pending the resolution of the Supreme Court, we regret to 
advise that we cannot yet grant your request", the said appellant already knew 
or should have known that a right was vested, only that its enforcement had to 
wait the resolution of this Court which it handed on February 15,1957, by 
maintaining its decision; A vested right or a vested interest may be held to 
mean some right or interest fn property that has become fixed or established, 
and is no longer open to doubt or controversy (Graham <em>vs</em>. Great Falls 
Water Power &amp; Town Site Co. [Mont] 76 Pac. 808, 810, citing Evan-Snider-Buel 
Co. <em>vs</em>. Mc Fadden, 10 Fed. 293, 44 CCA, 464 L. R. A. 900). Considering 
the facts and circumstances obtaining in the case, we agree with the lower court 
that the appellant herein had impliedly admitted the right of the petitioner to 
apply his backpay certificate in payment of his obligation. This 
notwithstanding, whether implied or expressed, the admission by the appellant of 
appellee's right, has already lost momentum or importance, because the law on 
the matter on April 24, 1956, when the offer to pay the obligation with the 
certificate was made, or the law before the amendatory Act of June 16, 1956, was 
the PNB was compelled to receive petitioner's backpay certificate.</p>
<p>Section 9-A of Republic Act No. 1576, passed on June 16, 1956, amending the 
Charter of the respondent-appellant bank, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority:</p>
<p>"* * * (<em>d</em>) In its discretion, to accept assignment of payments, 
certificates of indebtedness of the government or other such similar securities: 
<em>Provided, however, that the authority herein granted shall not be used as 
regards backpay certificates</em>."</p></blockquote>
<p>What would be the effect of this law upon the case at bar? "Laws shall have 
no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided" (Art. 4, New Civil 
Code). It is said that the law looks to the future only and has no retroactive 
effect unless the legislator may have formally given that effect to some legal 
provisions (Lopez, et al. <em>vs</em>. Crow. 40 Phil., 997, 1007); that all 
statutes are to be construed as having only prospective operation, unless the 
purpose and intention of the Legislature to give them a retrospective effect is 
expressly declared or is necessarily implied from the language used; and that 
every case of doubt must be resolved against retroactive effect (Montilla 
<em>vs</em>. Agustinian Corp., 24 Phil., 220). These principles also apply to 
amendments of statutes. Republic Act No. 1576 does not contain any provision 
regarding its retroactive nor such may be implied from its language. It simply 
states its effectivity upon approval. The amendment, therefore has no 
retroactive effect, and the present case should be governed by the law at the 
time the offer in question was made. The rule is familiar that after an act is 
amended, the original act continues to be in force with regard to all rights 
that had accrued prior to such amendment (Fairchild <em>vs</em>. U. S. 91 Fed. 
297; Hathaway <em>vs</em>. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., 99 F. 534).</p>
<p>It is true that "acts executed against the provisions of mandatory or 
prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself authorizes their 
validity" (Art 5, New Civil Code). It should be recalled, however, that since 
the prohibitive amendment of the appellant's charter should not be given 
retroactive effect; and that the law, at the time appellee made his offer, 
allowed, in fact compelled, the respondent bank to accept the appellee's 
certificate, the above provision finds no application herein.</p>
<p>In view hereof, mandamus is the proper remedy (Florentino case, 
<em>supra</em>, and the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with costs 
against the respondent-appellant.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Dizon, De Leon,</em> and <em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
