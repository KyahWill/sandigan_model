				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <u>certiorari</u> by Jose E. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> de Leon and
Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Lactao</span> to set aside the resolution <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u><span style=""> </span>of the Court of
Industrial Relations (CIR) dated September <span style="">14, </span>1962 in case 2490-ULP,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which reversed the decision of Presiding Judge Jose S. Bautista of June 30,
1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter decision ordered the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span>
Labor Union (hereinafter referred to as the BBLU) to readmit the complainants
to active membership in the <span style="">said union,
</span>and directed the respondent <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Development
Co., Inc, (hereinafter referred to as the Company) to reinstate them to their
former positions, with back wages from the date of their <span style="">dismissal </span>to the time of their actual
reinstatement, and with all <span style="">the
appertaining rights and privileges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts that <span style="">gave rise </span>to
the present petition <span style="">are </span>not
disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Federation of Free Workers
(FFW), in <span style="">a letter dated </span><span style="">May </span>3, 1960, informed the Company that a "great majori<span style="">ty" of the latter's employees had
organized the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Free Workers (FFW),</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that this new union had affiliated with the
FFW, and that a set of proposals was being formulated as the basis of a
prospective collective bargaining agreement between the said new union and the
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another letter </span><span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">4, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the FFW asked the Company to give a
"thorough study" to the collective bargaining proposals therein
enclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its reply of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">12,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Company
stated that it had "nothing against your union", but called attention
to the fact that it had already recognized the BBLU, which union had then been
in existence for four years, and with which it had concluded two collective
bargaining agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FFW then requested
that it </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">furnished a copy of the
second collective bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the Company did not honor the request, the FFW gave a copy of its
May </span><span style="">4
</span><span style="">letter to the Conciliation Service,
Regional </span><span style="">Office </span><span style="">3 of the Department
of Labor, on the basis of which a labor conciliator scheduled conferences
between the </span><span style="">FFW and the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
conferences held on May 12, </span><span style="">17, </span><span style="">and 30, and </span><st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="6"><span style="">June 9, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> in the office of the labor conciliator, the
latter ordered the Company to furnish the FFW a copy of the </span><span style="">collective
bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">This order was not complied with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, the
board of directors </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the BBLU held a </span><span style="">special meeting on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="6"><span style="">June </span><span style="">1,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, for the
purpose of taking ap­propriate steps against the petitioners herein who were
employees of the Company and members of the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board found that the petitioners had
"affiliated themselves with another labor union (<span class="SpellE">Artex</span>
Free Workers [F</span><span style="">FW]), </span><span style="">without first
terminating their membership" with the BBLU and "without the
knowledge of </span><span style="">the officers" of the latter union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same date, the board adopted a resolution, </span><span style="">the pertinent portions of which read </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the union after due investigation, has found Messrs.
Jose <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> de
Leon and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Lactao</span>, <u>guilty</u> <u>of</u> <u>disloyalty</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>union</u> <u>and</u> for the reason, have been <u>expelled</u>
<u>from</u><span style=""> <u>the union</u></span><span style="">, </span><u>thereb</u><u><span style="">y</span></u> <u>losing</u><span style=""> </span><u>their</u>
<u>good</u> <u>standing</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u><span style="">union</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, by virtue of the provisions of the Collective
Bargaining Agreement above mentioned, and <span style="">in order </span>to promote sanctity in the
observance of the Collective Bargaining Agreements, it has been resolved, as it
is hereby resolved, to inform the management of the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span>
Development Co., Inc., of the loss of good standing as members of <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Buhay</span> Labor </span><span style="">Union of said Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>,
de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Lactao</span>, by virtue of which they should be
</span>di<span style="">smissed, as it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">now resolved to ask the Company to dismiss them;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Be it resolved further that the Company be furnished a copy <span style="">of t</span>his resolution, and that the said
firm be advised that the union will be compelled to take such action as maybe
necessary to protect its interest, in case the Management should fail to comply
with its contractual obligation above-mentioned." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After receipt of the above resolution, the Company, having in
mind the closed-shop stipulation in the collective bargain<span style="">ing agreement, sent three identical letters,
all dated June </span>3, 1960, to the petitioners, advising them of the termination
of their employment effective June 3, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1960</st1:date>
<span style="">the petitioners lodged an unfair labor
practice charge </span>with the CIR <span style="">against the Company and the </span><span style="">BBLU.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They alleged that </span>they "were engaged in concerted
activities, more particularly to form the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Free
Workers (FFW) <span style="">due to the inability and
refusal </span>of the respondent company to <span style="">furnish them with [</span>a copy of] an
alleged collective bargaining agree­ment between the respondent labor union and
respondent company", and that without any valid cause but "due to
said concerted activities, the company dismissed them."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its </span>answer, the
respondent BBLU admitted that the peti<span style="">tioners
</span><span style="">were <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
members thereof, but averred that they </span><span style="">were </span>expelled from the union, <span style="">after due investigation, for acts </span>of disloyalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its answer, the Company denied <span style="">the charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It alleged that on March 4, 1960, it entered into a collective bar</span>gaining
agreement with the <span style="">BBLU after the </span><span style="">latter had satisfactorily demonstrated
majority </span><span style="">representation; </span><span style="">that the
petitioners </span>were dismissed at the behest of the BBLU due to loss of
their good standing as <span style="">union members;
and that refusal on </span><span style="">the part </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">Company of the union's demand for the
dismissal of the petitioners would constitute a violation of the collective bar</span><span style="">gaining </span><span style="">agreement and might </span><span style="">result in a union strike or in other punitive
</span><span style="">acts against the Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due trial, </span>Presiding
Judge Bautista rendered <span style="">judgment
finding that the petitioners were not aware of the </span><span style="">existence </span><span style="">of the collective bargaining </span>agreement, much less of its
closed-shop <span style="">provision, and holding, in
consequence, that they </span>were not bound <span style="">by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision observed the
provision in </span><span style="">question was </span><span style="">"merely
a cloak to cover </span><span style="">the
discriminatory </span><span style="">dismissal </span><span style="">of the complaints, due to their union
activities in forming </span><span style="">another </span><span style="">union, </span>which
the company <span style="">did </span>not like."
The Company was ordered <span style="">to reinstate
the </span><span style="">petitioners, with </span><span style="">back wages from the
date of </span><span style="">their dismissal and </span><span style="">"all the rights and privileges formerly
ap­pertaining thereto".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The BBLU was
ordered to readmit them to ac</span><span style="">tive
membership therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter the CIR, <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, set aside <span style="">the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It found </span>that the failure of the Company to furnish the peti­tioners
a copy of the collective bargaining agreement did not constitute an unfair
labor practice because furnishing them with any and all information on union
matters was the obligation of the BBLU; that the Company in dismissing them
merely complied with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement; and
that if there was any party liable under Republic Act 875, it was the BBLU and
not the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR, <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
concluded with the observation that "if warranted and desired, they [<span style="">the </span>petitioners] may file a case
against respondent labor union [BBLU] under the provisions of the Magna Charta
of Labor, unless it could be said that <span style="">there
is already <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence the present
recourse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The validity of the </span>collective
bargaining agreement of <st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1960</st1:date>
<span style="">is </span>not here assailed by the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor <span style="">do they deny that they were members </span><span style="">of the BBLU prior to </span><st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="3"><span style="">March </span><span style="">4, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, and
until they were expelled from the union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the </span><span style="">BBLU was the
lawful and proper bargaining representative of the non-supervisory employees of
the Company, is </span><span style="">not traversed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue tendered for
resolution, by the petitioner’s formulation, is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">"Is </span><span style="">it just and
lawful to enforce a contract [referring to the collective bargaining agreement]
against the employees who were unduly, unreasonably and illegally denied
knowledge of the contents thereof?" More particular reference is made by
them to the closed-shop provision of the agreement that states, "All
employees of the COMPANY must be members in good standing of the UNION as a
condition of continued employment with the COMPANY", which provision, the
petitioners claim, they were totally unaware of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argue, in essence, that because they
were ignorant of the provisions of the agreement, they cannot be bound by such
agreement, and that, therefore, their dismissal from the Company on the
strength of the closed-shop provision is unlawful and constitutes an unfair
labor practice on the part of both the Company and the BBLU.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Were the petitioners really unaware of the provisions of the
collective bargaining agreement during the period from <st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1960</st1:date>, when the agreement was entered
into, to the time they organized the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Free
Workers which was in the following month of April?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in our view, <span style="">is the vital issue of </span>fact that constitutes the vertex of this
case, es­pecially because the CIR, <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, did not <span style="">make any unequivocal findings </span>of fact
relative thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">A host of circumstances can be gleaned from the record that would
demonstrate persuasively that the petitioners were not unaware of the
provisions of the agreement in question <span style="">prior
to their organization of the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Free Workers
union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the admitted facts that the petitioners started work­<span style="">ing in </span>the Company in December 1959,
and that they succeeded in wielding sufficient influence to persuade other
employees to join them in forming the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Free
Workers, <span style="">we can reasonably </span>infer
that <span style="">they knew of the </span>existence
of the first collective bargaining agreement between the BBLU and the Company,
as well especially of the fundamental provisions thereof <span style="">regarding </span>check-off or payroll
deduction of union dues and assessments, vacation and sick leaves, hospital,
medical and dental care, working hours and overtime service, union meetings,
and the duration of the ag­reement -- provisions which are standard
stipulations in col<span style="">lective bargaining </span>agreements
and which affect, them <u>directly</u>, <u><span style="">personally</span></u><span style=""> <u>and</u> <u>individually</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They can </span>therefore be properly charged
with knowledge specifically of the expiry date of <span style="">the agreement </span>and, consequently, of the negotiations between the
BBLU and the Company before the said expiry date toward the <span style="">execution of a second agreement - which is
the agreement in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since in their </span>petition
they do not deny that they knew of <span style="">the
existence </span>of the second agreement, it <span style="">is </span>only natural to <span style="">presume
that they </span>knew of its provisions, and that they had ac<span style="">tually studied them in a comparative way in
order to be able to </span>formulate the collective bargaining proposals
submitted by them (the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Free Workers) to the
Company on May 4, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record <span style="">is </span>unmistakable that <span style="">before the BBLU recommended the dismissal of the petitioners because they
had violated the agreement, the officials </span>of the said union conducted <span style="">an investigation </span>of the actuations of
the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not
reveal any disavowal made by any of the petitioners of knowledge of the
closed-shop provision at any time prior to their dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disavowal came as an afterthought and was
articulated only after they had received their notices of discharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even after their dismissal, not one of them
protested either to the <span style="">BBLU or </span>the
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> testified that he went to Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Mariñas</span>, <span style="">personnel
manager of the </span>Company, and protested his dismissal, but <span class="SpellE">Mariñas</span> categorically declared that <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>
never went to <span style="">see </span>him regarding
the matter of <span style="">his </span>dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners' further
contention that the closed-shop </span><span style="">pro</span><span style="">vision in the collective </span><span style="">bargaining agreement is illegal because </span><span style="">it is an unreasonable restriction of the
right of freedom of association guaranteed </span>by the Constitution <span style="">is </span><span style="">a </span>futile <span style="">exercise </span>in <span style="">argumentation,
as this Court has in <span style="">a </span>number </span>of
cases sustained <span style="">closed-shop as a valid
form of union security.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, even if we assume, <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>argumentis</u></span>, that the petitioners were unaware
of <span style="">the stipulations set forth in the
collective bargaining agreement, since their membership in the BBLU </span>prior
to their expulsion <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> is <span class="SpellE">undenied</span>,
there can be no question that as long as the agreement with closed-shop
provision was in force, they were bound by it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither their ignorance of, <span style="">nor
their dissatisfaction with, its terms and conditions would justify breach
thereof or the formation by them of a union of </span>their own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has been aptly said, "a collective
bargaining agreement entered into by officers of a union, as agent of the members,
and an employer, gives rise to valid <span class="SpellE">enforcible</span>
contractual <span style="">relations, against the
individual union </span>members in matters that affect them peculiarly, and
against the union in matters that affect the entire membership or large classes
of its members,"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and "a union member who is employed under an agreement between the <span style="">union and his employer is </span>bound by the
provisions thereof, since it is a joint and several contract of the members of
the union en­tered into by the union as their agent."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of all the foregoing, we do not see <span style="">any unfair labor practice committed </span>by
either the Company or the BBLU.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the resolution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
