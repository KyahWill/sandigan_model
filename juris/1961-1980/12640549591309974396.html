<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Gregorio H. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> died of pulmonary tuberculosis contracted while 
working as letter-carrier in the post office of <span class="SpellE">Libmanan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sur</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Upon claim duly filed, 
compensation benefits were granted to his widow, Irene Fernandez, and to two 
minors, Manuel and Jose <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, alleged illegitimate 
(spurious) children of the deceased by another woman. The award is as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"1. To pay the heroin claimants, 
thru this Commission, the amount of THREE THOUSAND FORTY-FIVE PESOS AND 12/100

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. To reimburse the widow the

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3. To pay to this Commission the 
amount of P36.00 as fees (including the P5.00 fee for this review) pursuant to 
Section 55 of Act 3428, <span class="GramE">us</span> 
amended."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In due time the 
Government filed the instant petition for review.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Neither the compensability of 
<span class="SpellE">Espiritu's</span> death nor the award to his widow is 
disputed. What appellant objects to <span class="GramE">is</span> the extension of 
death benefits to the two minors. The objection is based on two grounds, the 
first of which is that not being acknowledged natural children they are not 
dependents within the meaning of Section 9 and 11 of the Workmen's Compensation 
Law, Act No. 3428, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Among the persons enumerated in 
Section 9 as entitled to compensation is "a son or daughter, if under eighteen 
years of age or incapable of supporting him or herself, and unmarried, whether 
actually dependent on the deceased or not." Section 11 in turn provides that the 
words "son," "daughter" or "children" include "illegitimate children 
acknowledged by and dependent upon the deceased before the injury was 
contracted." The contention is that according to this Court (<span class="SpellE">Madue√±o</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> Lumber Co., 73 Phil. 356) only natural children 
may be acknowledged and hence considered as "dependents" under the Workmen's 
Compensation Law. It should be noted, however, that the said case was decided 
under the regime of the old Civil Code, according to which recognition could be 
extended only to natural children and not to children of adulterous 
relationship. Appellant admits that in the new Civil Code (Art. 287 and 291) 
illegitimate children other than natural are given greater rights than before, 
among them the right of succession from their parents. But appellant maintains 
that said rights have nothing to do with the benefits granted by the Workmen's 
Compensation Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We do not consider it necessary 
to resolve this particular issue, for the claim in behalf of the two minors must 
fail on the other ground invoked by appellant, namely, that their <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> has not been established. This Court, construing 
the various pertinent provisions of the Civil Code concerning illegitimate 
children, has held that an illegitimate (spurious) child, to be entitled to 
support and <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights from his parents, must 
prove his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>, and this may be done by means of 
voluntary or compulsory recognition of the relationship. For this purpose the 
provisions concerning natural children are held applicable. Thus recognition is 
voluntary when made in the record of birth, a will, a statement before a court 
of record, or in any authentic writing (Article 278) ; and compulsory when made 
by means of a court action in the cases enumerated in Articles 283 and 284. 
(Pauline <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>, 113 Phil. 697).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case at bar, the minors 
<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> have not been voluntarily recognized as his 
by the deceased Gregorio H. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>. The only 
evidence adduced below consists of baptismal certificates; but these are not the 
records of birth referred to in Article 278. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Vidaurrazaga</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Court of Appeals, 91 Phil. 492; 
Capistrano vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabino</span>, 8 Phil. 135).</span> Neither do 
they constitute "authentic writing." They are proof only of the act to which the 
priest may certify by reason of his personal knowledge an act done by himself or 
in his presence" particularly the administration of the sacrament of baptism on 
the stated day; they are not proof of the truth of the declarations therein with 
respect to the parentage of the baptized children (Adriano vs. De Jesus, 23 
Phil. 350).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The fact that the minors had been 
living with Gregorio H. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> and were supported by 
him during his lifetime may be a ground for compulsory recognition (Article 
283), but it does not appear that the children ever instituted a suit to that 
end a suit that falls within the jurisdiction of the courts and not of 
respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision appealed from is 
modified by eliminating the award of compensation to the two minors. Under 
Section 8, paragraph (a) of the Workmen's Compensation Law, the widow is 
entitled to 45% of the deceased's weekly salary of P29.28 (P1<span class="GramE">,522.80</span> per annum) for a period of 208 weeks, or a total of 
P2,741.44. Appellant should pay this amount to the widow only instead of P3<span class="GramE">,045.12</span> to the widow and the minor children. In all other 
respects the decision is affirmed. <span class="GramE">Without 
costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
