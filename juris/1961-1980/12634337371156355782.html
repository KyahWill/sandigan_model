				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1964</st1:date>, by the Court of First Instance,
Branch II, at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in Criminal Case No. 9943, PP
vs. Jose <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Peping</span>,
and Francisco de la Cruz, alias <span class="SpellE">Pancit</span>, also alias <span class="SpellE">Francing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At his
arraignment, the accused De la Cruz pleaded guilty and was sentenced
accordingly, leaving the other defendant, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>, to
be tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> was convicted and
sentenced to death as follows:</p>

<blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, the Court finds defendant JOSE REPATO
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code
provides that any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or
intimidating of any person shall suffer (sub-paragraph 1) the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death, when by reason or on
occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, it was fully established
that defendants took advantage of nighttime in order to rob and that they
deliberately killed the deceased Francisco Bernal as shown by the fact that
they tied his hands and then shot him thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, therefore, two aggravating
circumstances in this case which should be considered in the imposition of the
penalty to the defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court hereby imposes the DEATH PENALTY upon the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant is further ordered
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Francisco Bernal in the sum of P822.00
as well as the value of the watch which had not been recovered in the amount of
P180.00<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span>
defendant shall also pay for the proportionate part of the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is also hereby condemned to indemnify the
heirs of the deceased Francisco Bernal in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the decision in this case has become final, the Clerk of
Court will return the valise as well as the pair of binoculars to the heirs of
the deceased.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> escaped from the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="8">August
 4, 1968</st1:date>, and is still at large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His escape does not affect this automatic review of the judgment of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People
vs. Cornelio, L-1289, June 7, 1971, 39 SCRA 435).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that before the incident which gave rise to this case,
both the accused lived with one <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three
worked in a construction project at <span class="SpellE">Balara</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, and they lived in a
bodega where the construction materials were stored. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the evening of <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>
saw <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> and De la Cruz take a carbine from under
the box which all of them used as a bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> cleaned the carbine, dismantled it, and
then wrapped the component pieces with a paper cement bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This bundle he inserted in another bundle
consisting of pieces of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
tied the last bundle and placed it in a <span class="SpellE"><u>buri</u></span>
bag which was secured by De la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both of the accused went out, although it was rainy and stormy; they
returned after <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their return, De la Cruz awakened <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>, who opened the door to admit them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two accused changed their clothes and <span class="GramE">laid</span> down to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span> did not see them bring back the <span class="SpellE"><u>bayong</u></span> which they were carrying when they went
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>
saw that they had brought back with them a leather valise.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of the next day, <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1960</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
Police Department received a report that one Francisco Bernal had been shot to
death and robbed the previous night at his residence in <span class="SpellE">Mapunso</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several
members of the police force, accompanied by the victim's common-law wife,
proceeded to the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was learned that the victim was an ex-Navy man and was a pensioner of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was in an isolated
place, and inside they saw the victim lying face downward in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, with his hands tied behind his back with galvanized
wire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policeÂ­men sent the body to
the <span class="SpellE">Funeraria</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiogue</span>
morgue at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> for examination by
NBI medico-legal officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The night of the killing, several articles belonging to the
victim had disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The missing
articles consisted of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>an
"Omega" wrist watch with the name "Francisco Bernal U.S.
Navy" engraved on the back, worth P180.00; a pair of binoculars costing
P100.00; two printed polo shirts worth P20.00; ten (10) pairs of trousers of
different kinds worth P450.00; one leather traveling trunk worth P150.00; one
traveling bag worth P45.00; one brief case worth P7.00; and cash money
amounting to P300.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1960</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Repato</span> went to the house of his cousin, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Damio</span>, at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Calsib</span>, Aguilar, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> had with him
a valise, a traveling bag, several pairs of pants, a pair of binoculars, a
newspaper, a jacket, and a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Damio</span>, later testifying for the prosecution, identified the
valise, the binoculars, and the carbine as articles which <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>
had brought to <span class="SpellE">Damio's</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Damio</span> testified
that <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> said he and others had robbed and killed
a man at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> showed him the <u>Manila Chronicle</u> of <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1960</st1:date>, which carried a
picture of the man who was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> admitted that he and De la Cruz were the ones who
killed the Navy man and that the carbine was the instrument used.</p>

<p class="BODY">After about two hours, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> left <span class="SpellE">Damio's</span> house, carrying with him the gun and a watch at the
back of which was engraved the name "Francisco Bernal." After four
days, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> returned to <span class="SpellE">Damio's</span>
house and tried to pawn the watch, but <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> refused
him because the watch was stolen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
days later, <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> learned that <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>
had killed someone in Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bucaclio</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Damio</span> further testified that
subsequently, he received the letter of <st1:date year="1960" day="3" month="10">October
 3, 1960</st1:date> written to him in the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
dialect by <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> who was then detained at the
provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter spoke of "an understanding
with respect to the articles that I had left in your place . . ." <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> later surrendered to the P.C. detachment at <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span> this letter, a traveling trunk, and binoculars.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Damio</span> identified the carbine as the one
which <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> had shown him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was previously interviewed by <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Santiago, an investigator of the PC detachment
assigned to <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> testified that <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> told the investigators that he had jotted down the
serial number of the carbine on a torn bus ticket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Damio</span> took from the
wall of his house Ticket No. 45-R issued by the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
Transportation Company, on the back of which was written 1755533, the serial
number of the firearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, Major Jose G. Fernandez, the chief of the
Ballistics Section of the PC, gave the opinion that evidence bullet which he
designated as "N" had been fired from the carbine rifle, Exhibit
"A".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Jesus <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> of the NBI medico-legal staff testified that he
conducted an autopsy on the body of the deceased Bernal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that the cause of death was
hemorrhage, severe, secondary to multiple gunshot wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Deputy Provincial Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Poquiz</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> brought to
the court the carbine after having obtained it from the Clerk of Court of the
Court of First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that the carbine was used as an exhibit in Criminal Case No. 41732, PP
vs. <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>, et al., where <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>
was found guilty of murder for having killed one <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vaelo</span> at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bucaclio</span>,
Aguilar, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, sometime before <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the carbine was the
instrument used to kill <span class="SpellE">Vaelo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the accused testified at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De la Cruz repudiated his sworn statement
given to the <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> Police Department on <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that statement he mentioned <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> as his companion in killing Bernal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in his testimony, he claimed that he
signed the statement without understanding the contents because he hardly
understood the <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also claimed that he was threatened with
maltreatment unless he mentioned <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> as his
companion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was not
convinced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court found that <span class="SpellE">Damio's</span> answers contained in his statement, Exhibit
"I", were true; and that his claim -that his companions in killing
the deceased Bernal were <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span> - is incredible and contrary to the evidence
submitted by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other accused, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>, denied
having committed the crime with which he is charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that on <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1960</st1:date>, he was employed at the Census
Bureau and that he reported for work on <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="8">August
 15, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied having
written the letter to <span class="SpellE">Damio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like De la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>
failed to convince the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, summarizing its findings of fact, found that
"defendants <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> and Francisco de la Cruz, the
latter already convicted because he had pleaded guilty, had really gone into
the house of the deceased Francisco Bernal in the night of August 14, 1960 and
then after they had tied his wrist behind his back with a piece of wire
(Exhibit D-1) they shot him to death with the carbine, Exhibit "A",
and thereafter they took and carried away with intent to gain several articles
belonging to the deceased, namely, one Omega watch on which the name Francisco
Bernal was engraved; one pair of binoculars with its leather case; some polo
shirts; and a jacket; and several pairs of pants."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Brief, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> submitted
"that a narration of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the
defense in this case would only be unnecessary." He assigned three
errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Firstly,</u> <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> contended that the lower court erred in giving full
faith and credit to the testimonies of the prosecution witÂ­nesses <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span> and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Damio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that their testimonies "are such
as would evoke suspicion that they are merely the results of their own
concoctions, contrary to the ordinary course of human conduct, bereft of any
semblance of truth, and tainted with improper and unlawful motives as would
make them inadmissible, as competent evidence in a court of justice." We
do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>
testified that he and the accused <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> were
co-workers in a construction project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> belied this, claiming that he could not possibly be
a laborer like <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span> because he "is a
clean-cut person, neat in appearance during the trial." We perceive no
incongruity between a clean-cut appearance and working in a construction
project.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span> also testified that after <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> had cleaned the carbine, he dismantled it and placed
it with pieces of wood inside a <span class="SpellE"><u>buri</u></span> bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> claims that
it is contrary to the ordinary course of human conduct for a person to
dismantle a gun which he intends to use only a few hours later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it was necessary to dismantle the
carbine, in order that it would fit in the <span class="SpellE"><u>buri</u></span>
bag, and in order that it would be inconspicuous among the pieces of wood in
the same bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is nothing
extraordinary about <span class="SpellE">Hermogene's</span> testimony on this
point, which indicates that <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> took precautionary
measures to avoid suspicion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> also assailed <span class="SpellE">Damio's</span> testimony as incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Damio</span> testified
that <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> went to his house in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1960</st1:date> and that
<span class="SpellE">Repato</span> confessed that, together with others, he had
robbed and killed Bernal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a man
makes a clean breast of an act of crime to another is not unusual, if both are
related by ties of consanguinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span> himself admitted that <span class="SpellE">Damio</span>
is his cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Damio</span>
also testified that he wrote the serial number of the carbine on the back of a
bus ticket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato</span>
characterizes <span class="SpellE">Damio's</span> act as an "unusual display
of interest." It is only a deep-seated sense of cynicism which would view
as unusual the civic-spirited act of a citizen in preserving evidence which he
suspects as pointing to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
act, instead of being viewed as eyebrow-raising, should instead be commended
and enÂ­couraged in order to assuage claims that ours is a society grown too
impersonal and uncaring.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the first assignment of errors banks on the improper
motive of revenge which allegedly impelled <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> to testify against <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said that in another case where <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> was accused, <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span> is
related to the deceased, while <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> is related to
the wife of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention does not hold water, for the general rule is that the relationship
of a witness to a victim does not render the clear and positive testimony of
witnesses less worthy of full faith and credit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ricaplaza</span>,
L-25856, April 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 374).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the appellant failed to prove his contention that these two
witnesses were motivated by revenge, for at the time they testified, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> had already been convicted in the other case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there is no credible evidence showing
that the witnesses are prejudiced against the accused, it is presumed that the
witnesses would not have imputed to the accused the commission of such a grave
offense if it was not true that he was really guilty thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. Ali, L-18519,
October 30, 1969, 29 SCRA 756).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Secondly</u>, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> claims that the
lower court erred in refusing to give full faith and credit to the testimonies
of the accused <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> and his witness co-accused De
la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We perceive no such error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De la Cruz tried to absolve <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>, and to pinpoint <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> as his comrades in crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But De la Cruz offered no proof to
substantiate his scenario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony
controverts his sworn statement which he later sought to recant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no proof that De la Cruz was
intimidated or coerced into executing and signing the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly said that he was "ordered
to sign it"; whereas, Lt. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, who
took the statement, testified as to the regularity of his investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We grant the presumption of regularity to the
law-enforcement officer, and discount the claim to the contrary sought to be
foisted by the accused De la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, De la Cruz asserted that the carbine marked as "Exhibit
A" is not the one used in the robbery-killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But ballistic examination showed that at
least <span class="GramE">one evidence</span> bullet recovered came from the
carbine introduced as Exhibit "A".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This proof, buttressed by the positive testimony of the other
prosecution witnesses, serves to demolish the posture of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to <span class="SpellE">Repato's</span> testimony, we
reject his claims of credibility for reasons already discussed in our
exposition on the first assignment of error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, we uphold the reliance by the lower court on the authenticity
of the letter which the witness <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> identified as
having been written by <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well settled is the rule that where the issue
is one of credibility of witnesses, the appellate court will generally not
disturb the findings of the trial court, considering that it is in a better
position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and
observed their treatment and manner of testifying during the trial, unless it
has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if
considered, might affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>, et al., L-27708, December 19, 1970, 36 SCRA 401).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Thirdly</u>, <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> contends that
the lower court erred in convicting him of robbery with homicide and
consequently imposing upon him the extreme penalty of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His theory is that the three principals - De
la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Damio</span>
- committed the killing for a fee, and they committed robbery as an
after-thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have given short
shrift to <span class="SpellE">Repato's</span> effort to unload his burden of
guilt on the innocent shoulders of <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span> and <span class="SpellE">Damio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
evidence shows that the accused from the very start intended to commit robbery,
and committed the killing to insure the absence of any witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the incident, <span class="SpellE">Hermogene</span>
confronted De la Cruz, who admitted what he and <span class="SpellE">Repato</span>
had done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When pressed for the source of
the articles they bore, De la Cruz admitted that: "It was from a Navy
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we got the things <span class="SpellE">Repato</span> shot him." <span class="GramE">(T. s. n. January
23, 1962 at p. 11).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repato's</span> account of the incident also bears out the proper
sequence of events, for he told <span class="SpellE">Damio</span> that he and De
la Cruz had "robbed and killed the Navy man in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>. February 26, 1963 at p. 31, 32, 34).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found two aggravating circumstances: "that
defendants took advantage of nighttime in order to rob and that they
deliberately killed the deceased Francisco Bernal." It appears, however,
that the prosecution failed to produce any evidence to show that the
conspirators purposely sought the cover of nighttime, or that it facilitated
the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we
are unable to appreciate <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> as an aggravating
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we take note that,
according to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the accused "deliberately
killed the deceased Francisco Bernal as shown by the fact that they tied his hands
and they shot him thereafter." We take this passage to mean that the crime
was attended by treachery i.e., by "employing means, methods or forms in
the execution thereof which tend directly and specifically to insure its
execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended
party might make."</p>

<p class="BODY">In robbery with homicide, treachery is only a generic aggravating
circumstance and is not qualifying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not change the qualification of homicide to murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery was appreciated in robbery with
quadruple homicide where the two victims were killed while bound in such a way
as to be deprived of opportunity to repel the attack or escape with any
possibility of success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP vs. Madrid, L-3023, Jan. 3, 1951, 88 Phil. 1).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is treachery when the victim was first bound before being
killed because such means tended directly and particularly to insure the
consummation of the crime without risk to the aggressors, inasmuch as thus
bound and disarmed, the victim could not defend himself in any manner against
his assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(PP
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span> No. 422, March 14, 1902; 1 Phil. 165).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A line of cases holds uniformly that the
killing of a person while bound is treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(These rulings are exemplified by the later cases of PP vs. <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, L-27903, Dec. 26, 1969, 30 SCRA 934; and PP vs. <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, L-23514, Feb. 17, 1970, 31 SCRA 401).</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the crime to be attended by the aggravating circumstance
of treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
Revised Penal Code, Art.</span> 294 (1) imposes the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death, when by reason or on
occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the law prescribes a penalty composed
of two indivisible penalties, and there is present one aggravating
circumstance, the greater penalty shall be applied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is hereby affirmed by imposing upon the accused the penalty of death, with the
modification that the indemnity to be paid to the heirs of the deceased shall
be in the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant is also ordered to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P822.00, as well as the value of the
