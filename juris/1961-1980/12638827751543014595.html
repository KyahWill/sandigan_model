with preliminary mandatory injunction filed by petitioners on September 13,
1971, which was amended on January 13, 1972 so as to include Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> as respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Ebarle</span> and Javier <span class="SpellE">Ariosa</span> are
residents of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and qualified voters of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> province, while
respondents Vicente M. <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> and Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> are also residents of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> was then the duly elected
Congressman for the lone district of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in the elections of <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1969</st1:date>, and as such Congressman had performed
his duties up to the last sessions of Congress in 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he was proclaimed official candidate
of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party for the position of
Governor for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
to which he filed his certificate of candidacy dated <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1971</st1:date> for the <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1971</st1:date> elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 4, 1971, the Provincial Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on the basis
of the election returns received by said Board, proclaimed, among others,
respondents Vicente M. <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> and Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> as the duly elected Governor and Vice-Governor,
respectively, of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After his proclamation as the Governor-elect, respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span>
refused to take his oath of office as Provincial Governor and publicly made
known his intention to assume his position as Congressman of the lone district
of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, under
the provisions of Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6388,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
otherwise known as the Election Code of 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for <i>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
</i>and <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary mandatory injunction wherein
petitioners contend, among others, (1) that the unilateral and deliberate act
of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> in forfeiting his new position
as Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6388 by merely
refusing to take his oath of office, is illegal and against public policy
because it negated and violated the electoral mandate of the people on November
8, 1971 and, therefore, said forfeiture is null and void and without effect;
(2) that to construe the aforementioned Section 24 as permitting any member of
Congress who is elected to the position of Governor to either reject or accept
the people's mandate at his discretion would violate the essence of a democracy
and, as such, said Section 24 would be unconstitutional for being a class
legislation; (3) that respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> in filing
his certificate of candidacy for Provincial Governor, offering himself to be
voted upon, and consenting to be proclaimed winner as Governor in the elections
of November 8, 1971, had irrevocably accepted the electoral mandate of the
sovereign will of the people of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> to serve as Governor, and, consequently, said
acceptance constitutes and operates as a forfeiture and an abandonment of his
office as Congressman; (4) that respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span>
is doing or about to assume the duties of Congressman for the lone district of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, contrary to
his political campaign speeches and printed propaganda,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that once elected he will finish his full term as Governor; and
(5) that the commission or continuance of the act complained of during the
litigation would surely work injustice not only to herein petitioners as taxpayers
and residents of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
but also the whole people of said province, who would be deprived of the
invaluable services of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> as
Governor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners then prayed that
judgment be issued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) immediately
commanding respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> to assume and hold the
position of Governor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>; (2) declaring Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6388
unconstitutional for being a class legislation; (3) in the event that said
Section 24 is not declared unconstitutional, declaring the forfeiture of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> of his new position as Governor,
null and void and without effect for being against public policy; (4) declaring
that by the election of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> as
Governor on November 8, 1971, he has forfeited his position as Congressman of
the lone district of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>; (5) ordering respondent Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
to vacate the position of Governor in favor of respondent Vicente M. <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span>; and (6) ordering the respondents to pay the costs
of this suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, respondent Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
took his oath of office on January 1, 1972 as Vice-Governor for <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> before District
Judge <span class="SpellE">Asaali</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Isnani</span>,
Branch II, of the Court of First<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the failure of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> to qualify as
the Governor-elect, respondent <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> took his oath
of office as Governor for <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> on January 2, 1972 before said Judge <span class="SpellE">Isnani</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Likewise, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Enerio</span>,
who took her oath of office as Senior Provincial Board Member on <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1972</st1:date>, succeeded respondent <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> and took her oath of office as Vice-Governor on <st1:date year="1972" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1972</st1:date> before Judge <span class="SpellE">Isnani</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In their amended answer, respondents <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> admit some of the allegations of the
petition and deny the rest thereof, and, by way of affirmative and special
defenses contend:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the amended
petition states no cause of action for petitioners, who are mere taxpayers and
residents of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
do not claim title to the governorship in question, hence, they are not the
real party in interest under Section 6 of Rule 66 of the Revised Rules of
Court; (b) that the amended petition is insufficient in form and substance
under Section 3 of Rule 65 of said Rules, and that <i>mandamus</i> is not the
proper remedy to compel the undoing of an act already done,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
thereby rendering this case moot and academic; (c) that respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span>, who was then the incumbent Congressman, is a
national official and, therefore, he is not covered by the prohibition of
Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6388;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(d)
that this action was filed prematurely, considering that the original petition
was filed on December 13, 1971, and this defect cannot be cured by the
subsequent filing on January 13, 1972 of an amended petition so as to include
Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> as co-respondent;<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
(e) that respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> did not take the oath of
office as Governor of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and, in accordance with the second paragraph of Section
24 of Republic Act No. 6388, he has forfeited his right thereto; (f) that the
conditions for judicial determination of constitutional questions are absent;
(g) that there was no notice served by the petitioners, who are questioning the
validity of Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6388, upon the Solicitor General who
is entitled to be heard, pursuant to Section 3 of Rule 64 of the Revised Rules
of Court; and (h) that this amended petition has omitted other necessary or
proper parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this case, the
1935 Constitution was superseded by the New Constitution, which took effect on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>, replacing the
presidential system and its bicameral legislature, with that of a parliamentary
system and its unicameral National Assembly with an <i>interim</i> National
Assembly to function during the period of transition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the <i>interim</i> National
Assembly was abolished and, in lieu thereof, the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>, a new <i>interim</i> legislative body, was
created.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The afore-mentioned changes in
the political institutions, the expiration of the term of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> as a Member of the defunct Congress, and the
termination of the four-year term of the Governor, have rendered the issues
raised in the petition moot.</p>
