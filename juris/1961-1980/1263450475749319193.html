				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is the second motion that the defendant-appellant has filed
relative to this Court's decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="9">September
 12, <span style="">1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
first was a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accepting the nullity of the other contracts (<span class="SpellE">Plff</span>
<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 4-7), the defendant-appellant nevertheless
contended that the lease contract (<span class="SpellE">Plff</span> <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3) is so separable from the rest of the contracts that
it should be saved from invalidation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">denying </span>the
motion, we pointed to the circumstances ?</p>

<blockquote>“that on November <span style="">15, 1957, </span>the parties entered into the lease contract for <span style="">50 </span>years; that ten days after, that is
on November 25, they amended the contract so as to make it cover the entire
property of Justine Santos; that on December 21, less than a month after, they
entered into another contract giving <span style="">Wong
</span><span class="SpellE">Heng</span> the option to buy the leased premises
should his pending petition for naturalization be granted; that on November 18,
<span style="">1958, </span>after failing to secure
naturali­zation and after finding that adoption does not confer the citizenship
of the adopting parent on the adopted, the parties entered into two other
contracts extending the lease to 99 years and fixing the period of the option to
buy at <span style="">50 </span>years.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">which indubitably demonstrated that each
of the contracts in question was designed to carry out <span class="SpellE">Justina</span>
Santos' expressed wish to give the land to Wong and thereby in effect place its
ownership in alien hands,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
about which <span style="">we </span>shall have something
more to say toward the end of this resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We concluded that "as the lease contract was part of <span style="">a </span>scheme to violate the Constitution
it suffers from the same infirmity that renders the other contracts void and
can no more be saved from illegality than the rest of the contracts."</p>

<p class="BODY">The present motion is for a new trial and is based on three
documents executed by <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos which, so it is
claimed, constitute newly-discovered material evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These documents are a codicil dated <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1957</st1:date> and two wills
executed on August 24 and <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="8">August 29,
 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the codicil,
Justine Santos not only named <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> <span class="SpellE">LaO</span> the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of her estate with the right to buy the
properties of the estate, but also provided that if the said La0 was legally
disqualified from buying (as she really was under article 1491(3) of the Civil
Code), she was to be her sole heir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
either case, the codicil imposed on the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
the obligation to have masses said for the soul of the <span class="SpellE">testratrix</span>
and of the latter's sister and parents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, in both her 1959 wills <span class="SpellE">Justina</span>
Santos enjoined her heirs to respect the lease contract made, and the
conditional option given, in favor of Wong.</p>

<p class="BODY">These documents form part of the records of civil case <span style="">59470 </span>of the Court of First Instance
of Manila in which the settlement of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Justina</span>
Santos is pending, and so it is now claimed that they could not have been
produced at the trial of this case which was concluded on August <span style="">6, </span>1960 because they were presented in
the probate court only after the death of Justine Santos on December 28, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a misrepresentation of the grossest sort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The documents were known to the
defendant-appellant and her counsel even before the death of <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As a
matter of fact, the wills executed on August 24 and <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="8">August <span style="">29, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>were presented in this case as
Exhibits 285 and <span style="">279, res</span>pectively,
for the defendant-appellant, and were considered and expressly referred to in
the decision of the lower court and in our decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for the codicil of <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="11">November 11, <span style="">1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the defendant-appellant can hardly
feign ignorance of its existence even when this case was being tried in the
lower court, considering that its provisions were substantially adverted to in
the testimony of one of her own witnesses<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and were in fact recited in the decision <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
By no means can the documents in question be considered newly -discovered
evidence so as to warrant a reopening of this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there anything in the documents that is likely to alter
the result <span style="">we </span>have already
reached in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to
the 1957 codicil, it is claimed that <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos
could not have intended by the 99-year lease to give Wong the ownership of the
land considering that she had earlier (the codicil was made on November 11,
1957 while the lease contract was<span style=""> </span>executed
on November 15, 1957) devised the property to <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> <span class="SpellE">LaO</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without passing on the validity of her testamentary disposition
since the issue is one pending before the probate court, it suffices to state
here that even granting that <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos had
devised the land in dispute to <span class="SpellE">LaO</span>, <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos was not thereby barred or precluded from
subsequently giving the land to Wong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The execution of the lease contract which, together with the other
contracts, amount to a transfer of ownership to Wong, constitutes an implied
revocation of her codicil, at least insofar as the disposition of the land is
concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As for the 1959 wills, it is said that they manifest a desire to
abide by the law, as is evident from the statement therein that Wong's right to
buy the land be allowed "anytime he or his children should be entitled to
buy lands in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(<u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., upon becoming Filipino citizens)".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems obvious, however, that this is
nothing but a reiteration of the substance of the lease contract and the
conditional option to buy which in combination, as our decision demonstrates,
amount to a conveyance - the protestation of compliance with the law
notwithstand­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases like the one
at bar, motives are seldom avowed and avowals are not always candid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem is not, however, insuperable,
especially as in this case the very witnesses for the defendant-appellant
testified that ?</p>

<blockquote>"Considering her age, ninety (90) years old at the time and
her condition, she is a wealthy woman, it is just natural when she said <span style="">'<u>This is what I, want and this will be
done</u>.' </span>In particular refer­ence to this contract of lease, when I
said 'This is not proper,' she said - 'You just go ahead, you prepare that, <u><span style="">I am the owner, and if there is illegality, I
</span>the only one </u><u><span style="">that can
question the ill</span>egality</u>.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The ambition of the old woman before
her death, according to her revelation to me, was to see to it that these
properties be enjoyed, <u>even</u> <u>to</u> <u>own</u> them, by Wong <span class="SpellE">Heng</span> because <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> told me that she did not have any relatives, near
or far, and she considered Wong <span class="SpellE">Heng</span> as a son and his
children her grandchildren; especially her consolation in life was when she
would hear the children reciting prayers in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>“She was very emphatic in the care of the
seventeen (17) dogs and of the maids who helped her much, and she told me to
see to it that no one could disturb <span style="">Wong
</span>Hang from those properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is
why we thought of adoption, believing that thru adoption Wong Hong might
acquire Filipino citizenship; being the adopted child of a Filipino citizen.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The other points raised
in the motion for new trial either have already been </span>disposed of in our
decision or are <span style="">so insubstantial to
merit any attention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the motion </span>for new <span style="">trial is denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
