Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Cipring</span> de la Cruz of the crime of Robbery
in Band with Double Homicide and imposing upon them the capital punishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution narrates the occurrence as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>,
64 years of age, was the light-house keeper at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Hinamok</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basey</span>, <st1:place><span class="GramE">Western</span> <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October
 29, 1968</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon, he was proceeding to light the lamp at the said light-house,
which is about two-thirds of a kilometer away from his house on the seashore,
where he and his wife, Adriana <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, he met <span class="SpellE">Elmerio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Banasan</span>, a fisherman who had just arrived from
fishing, and who informed him that he saw some persons disembark from a
motorized <span class="SpellE">banca</span> (referred to in the transcript as a
"<span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span>").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Looking towards the sea, <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
saw a "<span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span>" anchored at about "40
<span class="SpellE">brazas</span>" from the "beach of the
lighthouse".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was painted green
and yellow with a roof covering the boat so that when someone enters, he cannot
be seen.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Noting nothing unusual, he proceeded on his way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the base of the lighthouse, he
saw a person crouching behind the cogon <span style="">grass
</span>about four arm's-lengths away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
called out saying "who are you, what are you doing there?" The man
stood up, followed by four others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were all armed, two with revolvers, one with a rifle and still another with a
homemade shotgun or "<span class="SpellE">paltik</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of them encircled him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the men who was carrying a revolver
and whom he came to know later as the accused, Benito de la Cruz, ordered the
others to hogtie him, warning him not to shout and resist otherwise he would be
killed; while another, whose name he knew later as <span class="SpellE">Cipring</span>
de la Cruz, took his bolo away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
Benito de la Cruz inquired where he kept the .38 cal. rifle and .45 cal. <span class="GramE">pistol</span> issued by the Government to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> denied
having those firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then taken
by Benito, <span class="SpellE">Cipring</span> and another companion to a nearby
cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After being made to sit, his
upper arms were tied to the post of a tomb with his feet likewise tied to the
fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cipring</span>
tied <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> arms loosely but Benito told him <span style="">to </span>tighten it in order to prevent
escape. Then Benito de la Cruz asked <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> which
part of his house was open and <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> replied that
it was the door and window facing the sea.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The group then stuffed <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> mouth with a
piece of cloth and a handkerchief, and before leaving, Benito told him that
they would kill his wife and would return to kill him too.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of that same day, <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saborrido</span>, a fisherman,
whose house is near that of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, was unloading
coconut shells from his <span class="SpellE">banca</span> and carrying them to
his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While doing so, he noticed a
motorized <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, which had come from the direction of
the lighthouse, drop anchor in front of <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">banca</span>
was about fifty meters away from where he was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then he saw seven men disembark and proceed uphill towards the direction
<span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not bother to see what
those persons <span style="">were </span>up to as he
was far from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only the next
day that he saw the dead body of one <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Estriber</span> on the beach about 30 meters away from where he
was unloading coconut shells the night before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also saw the dead body <span class="GramE">of</span> <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> wife, with hands and legs tied to a piece of
wood, lying face up, with a strip of rattan tied tightly around her neck.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> remained tied at the cemetery
until <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> the next morning
when the barrio teenagers found and untied him <span style="">and informed him that his wife and <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Estriber</span> had been killed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reaching home, he saw the dead body of his wife about three arm's
lengths from their abode.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside his
house, things were in disarray, and the following were missing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>radio, cash, flashlight, one can of rice, canned
goods, three pairs of earrings, two gold necklaces, three suitcases and a trunk
of clothes, all valued at P1<span class="GramE">,313.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The dead body of <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Estriber</span> was found on
the beach in front of <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> house, with wounds on
the left and right breast. Dr. Harry S. <span class="SpellE">Marabut</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing chain of
circumstances, pieced together, in point of time and by sequence of events,
point to one conclusion - that appellants and their companions were the ones
who tied up <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> in the cemetery; thence, they
proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> house, as they themselves had
categorically told <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter place, they must still have
looked for the firearms issued to <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, as shown
by the fact that <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> found things in the house in
disarray.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they robbed the
house and on that occasion killed Adriana <span class="SpellE">Bago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Estriber</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Adriana was bound hand and foot is
characteristic of the same maltreatment that <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
received in the cemetery when his arms, his hands and his feet were also bound
and tied by appellants and their companions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Additionally, after a
search along the northeastern coast of </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leyte</span></span></st1:place><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
accompanied by the police, chanced upon a motorized <span class="SpellE">banca</span>

 29, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when he saw the owners thereof upon being
summoned by the police, he readily recognized them to be the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they did not recognize him nor suspected

mission by inviting people to drink in a store by the seashore.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants, however,
assail <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> testimony in that being an old man,
64 years of <span class="GramE">age,</span> he already had a faulty memory as
shown by the fact that he could not even remember the names of the policemen
who accompanied him during the search.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> While this may be so, it does not
necessarily follow that he would have the same difficulty recognizing the faces
of persons who had maltreated him and who had killed his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The passage of forty-three days from the
commission of the robbery and homicide up to the date the appellants were
identified and arrested would neither dim his memory after having undergone
such a harrowing and traumatic experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants further
contend that during the months of October, November and December, it is of
common knowledge that the days are shorter and the nights longer so that at </span><st1:time minute="25" hour="17"><span style="">5:25 P.M.</span></st1:time><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Bago</span> could no longer have seen clearly the faces of
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note can be taken of the
fact, however, that at that hour in October, objects and people are still rea­dily
discernible especially at short distances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be recalled that appellants not only came very near to <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, but they even tied him and talked to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came close enough and stayed long enough
with him to enable him to see and remember their faces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The inconsistencies in <span class="SpellE">Melchor's</span> <span class="GramE">testimony,</span> such as the
time he was released from the cemetery as compared to the hour the autopsies
were conducted, is a minor detail that does not affect his basic credibility,
but on the contrary, enhances it for it belies that his version of the incident
has been concocted or rehearsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial Court neither
erred in giving credence and weight to the testimony of the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Basey</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, to the effect that
he had investigated appellant <span class="SpellE">Cipring</span> de la Cruz and
had reduced it to writing, but that the latter changed his mind and refused to
sign it two days later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense has
not presented any convincing reason that would impel us to disregard his
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Chief of Police, he acted
in the performance of his official duty, and the legal presumption remains that
official duty has been regularly performed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In regards the unsigned statement of <span class="SpellE">Cipring</span> de la Cruz, taken on December 14, 1968, we find no
error on the part of the trial Court in admitting it as part of the Chief of
Police's testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that affidavit, <span class="SpellE">Cipring</span> ad­mitted having been with a group at the
lighthouse at <span class="SpellE">Hinamok</span> Island, having tied an old man,
having gone to the latter's house, and having left that place with loot, except
that he claimed that he and his brother had been merely forced to go with them
under duress and at the point of a gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, therefore, that the general tenor of the affidavit was
exculpatory, the defense cannot successfully allege that it was a mere
fabrication of the Chief of Police, besides the fact that it listed names of
people from <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leyte</span></span></st1:place><span style="">, unknown to the Chief of Police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And more importantly, that affidavit was not
the sole basis of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the
combination of circumstances surrounding the occurrence which convinced the

guilty; thus,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were the very persons who later in that evening disembarked from the same
motorboat near the house of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it
was proved that Benito de la Cruz, accused herein, revealed their intention to
rob and kill Adriana when he asked <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> in the
cemetery which part of his house was opened, and then when they demanded from
him where his two pistols were being kept.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And before they left <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> in the cemetery,
they informed him that they are going to kill his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court entertains no doubt that these two
