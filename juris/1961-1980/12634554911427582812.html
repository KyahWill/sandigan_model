				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is one of the many cases that arose from the settlement of
the controversy between the <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> family and the J.
M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Co., Inc., over a tract of land in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City of about 50 <span class="SpellE"><u>quiñones</u></span>,
in virtue of a Compromise Agreement said parties entered into on March 16,
1953. Being questioned here on appeal by the spouses Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lucina</span> Arroyo-<span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>, is the order of dismissal by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of their complaint in Civil Case No.
Q-7801, filed against J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., and
involving a lot covered in the aforementioned compromise agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears on record that under date of <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1958</st1:date>, J. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., instituted in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Civil Case No. Q-4275, recovery of possession of a portion of its land, of
about 1,000 square meters, in <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Matalahib</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>,
to have been usurped by therein defendant Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="8" month="9">September
 8, 1959</st1:date>, judgment was rendered in the case, for the plaintiff, the
court ruling as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"An examination of the evidence presented will reveal that
plaintiff has sufficiently established its cause of action against the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the
claim of the plaintiff is based on a title issued in accordance with the
Torrens System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such plaintiff is
entitled to the possession of the aforesaid parcel of land registered in its
name unless it has expressly authorized the defendant to possess the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, it has been admitted
that the possession of the defendant is made without the knowledge and consent
of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can now the Court
decree a judgment in favor of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To do so would be tantamount to violation of the cardinal principle
underlying the adoption of the Torrens System in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, defendant and all persons claiming under him were
ordered to vacate the premises and to remove the existing, construction there­on,
and to pay a monthly rental of P100.00 from <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1959</st1:date> until possession is restored to
plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having failed to perfect a timely appeal from this decision
therein defendant filed a motion for new trial and for the setting aside of
judgment, which motion was denied for being out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appealed to this Court, the lower court's
order of denial of the said motion for new trial, was affirmed (L-16757,
November 29, 1963).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, on <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="2">February
 10, 1964</st1:date>, the spouses Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Lucina</span> Arroyo-<span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>
commenced the present proceeding by filing a complaint in the Court of First
instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>.
Case No. Q-7801), praying for annulment of the judgment in Civil Case No. 4275,
the declaration of their right to purchase the land described therein at the
price prevailing at the time when they demanded the sale of said lot to them,
and for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to plaintiffs, by the
defendant, of the title to that property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> S Co., Inc.
moved for the dismissal the complaint, raising the defenses of bar by former
judgment - referring to the final decision in Civil Case No. 4275 - and lack of
cause of action - on the basis of the aforementioned final judgment in the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> action and of the ruling of this Court in the
case of J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Sustaining the allegations of defendant, the court below issued the order of
dismissal subject of the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants dispute the correctness of the dismissal of their
complaint, contending that the decision in Civil Case No. 4275, on herein <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> right to possession of the lot, is not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the
issue involved in Civil Case No. 7801 which is an action for recovery of
ownership and annulment of judgment or for specific performance that the
rescission of the Compromise Agreement between the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
and J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. does not affect their
right to purchase the lot in dispute; and that for the defenses of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> and
lack of cause of action to cause the dismissal of a complaint, they must appear
on the face of that pleading, which allegedly is not so in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find this appeal without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower Court correctly ruled that the present action is barred
by the final judgment rendered in the previous case of <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>, Civil Case No. Q-4275, of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is plain: if the herein appellants
really had a preferential right to a conveyance of the land from J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., or if the certificate of (Torrens) title
held by <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. were truly void and
ineffective, then these facts should have been pleaded by these appellants in
the previous case (Q-4275), since such facts, if true, constituted a defense to
the claim of <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. for recovery of
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If appellants failed to
plead such defenses in that previous case, they are barred from litigating the
same in any subsequent proceeding, for it is a well established rule that as
between the same parties and on the same subject and cause of action, a final
judgment is conclusive not only on matters directly adjudicated, but also <u>as
to any another matter that could have been raised in relation thereto</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Civil Case No. 4275, filed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
against appellants was for recovery of possession of the lot, whereas Civil
Case No. 7801, brought by appellants against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> or recovery of ownership of the
same property, and that the subject lot in the first case is smaller (1,000 sq,
m.) than that in the second (1,400 sq. m.), do not remove the present proceeding
from the operation of the principle of bar by former judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As specifically stated in the decision in
Civil Case No. 4275, now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the
right of therein plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein) to
possession of the lot was based on a title issued to the latter in accordance
with the Torrens System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
the recognition of the incidental right to possession of the property is
predicated upon the court's recognition of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
right of ownership thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, a
change in the form of action or in the relief sought, it must remembered, does
not remove a proper case from the application of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have also pointed out in our decision in <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>, L-16836, January 30, 1962,
that the preferential right to purchase the lot in question (as now claimed by
appellants) was in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim in the previous
action for possession, and that the failure to set it up resulted in a waiver
thereof, the claimant being thereafter barred from invoking it after the
judgment in the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> action became final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants assert in their reply brief (p. 7) that they did
assert such compulsory counterclaim in their answer in the previous suit, Case
No. Q-4275.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such were the case, then
this counter­claim was decided adversely to them when the Court in that case
decided in favor of <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. and ordered
defendants there (appellants <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> here) to vacate
and restore the premises in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
allowing that decision to become final, appellants are again <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> from interposing the same facts and claim
in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public policy is firmly set against unnecessary multiplicity of
suits; the rule of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>,
like that against splitting causes of action, are all applications same policy,
that matters once settled by a Court's final judgment should not thereafter be
invoked again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Relitigation</span>
of issues already settled merely burdens the Courts and the taxpayers, creates
uneasiness and confusion, and wastes valuable time and energy that could be
devoted to worthier cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Roman
maxim goes, <u>Non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>bis</u></span> <u>in</u> <u>idem</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision appealed from is, therefore, affirmed with costs
against appellants <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>.</p>
