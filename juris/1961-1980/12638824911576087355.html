of the decision of the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission affirming
the award of death compensation benefits made by the Acting Referee of the
Workmen's Compensation Section, <span style="">Regional
Office No. 4, </span>Department of Labor, in favor of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span> was employed by
petitioner Delgado Brothers, Inc. as a "plant-in-charge" at the <span style="">petitioner's compound in <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>,
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a "plant-in-charge" <span class="SpellE">Palero</span> had something to do with the care of and in some way
in charge of the plant <span style="">of the company
for which reason he was given the privilege of living within the premises of
the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He received a salary of
P58.00 a week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1973</st1:date>,
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Calupitan</span>,
another employee of petitioner, had a drinking spree near the house of the
former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a Sunday, they did not
have any work on that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 P.M.</st1:time> of the same day, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span> conducted Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Calupitan</span>
to his home as he was already drunk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they were already near the house of <span class="SpellE">Calupitan</span>,
Alfredo Moral, the officer-in-charge of the security guards who was then on
duty, saw Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Calupitan</span> quarreling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alfredo Moral approached the two and tried to pacify them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span>
tried to meet Alfredo Moral and wrest his gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the latter and Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span> were
wrestling for the gun, the same went off hitting Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few hours later, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Palero</span> expired as a result of the gunshot wounds he
sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1974</st1:date>,
Gloria <span class="SpellE">Palero</span>, the widow of the deceased, for and in
behalf of her four minor children <span style="">filed
</span>a Notice of Death and Claim for Compensation with the Workmen's Compensation
Section of Regional Office No. 4, Department of Labor (RO4-WCC Case No.
157334).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1975</st1:date>, petitioner submitted to the Workmen's
Compensation Sec<span style="">t</span>ion of the
Department of Labor, Regional Office No. 4, the required Employer's Report of
Accident or Sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said report it <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the claim of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, private respondent was required
to submit the affidavits of her witnesses and other documentary evidence to
establish her claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his verbal
request the Acting Referee issued an o<span style="">rder
allowing petitioner to submit counter-affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on the affidavits and counter-affidavits
submitted by the parties, the Acting Referee rendered a decision on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September
 30, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, considering the above premises, judgment is hereby
rendered in favor of the Claimant and minor children and order足ing the
Respondent to pay the Claim足ant and minor children, through this Office, the
following, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Total sum of Six Thousand

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Total sum of Sixty-One
Pesos (P61.00) to the Workmen's Compensation <span style="">Fund, </span>as Decision and administrative fee, pursuant to Section 55
of the Act, as amended."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of
the decision of the Acting Referee but the same was denied and so the entire
records of the case were elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1976</st1:date>, the Workmen's Compensation Commission, <u><span style="">en</span></u><span style=""> <u>banc</u> rendered a decision affirming the decision of the Acting
Referee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the respondent Commission,
petitioner has come to this Court on a petition <span style="">for review, raising </span>the <span style="">following
issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WHETHER THE DEATH OF THE
DECEASED FERNADO PALERO IS COMPENSABLE UNDER THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT, AS
AMENDED, ALTHOUGH THE SAME IS DUE TO GUN足SHOT WOUND SUSTAINED BY HIM WHILE
TRYING TO WREST FORCIBLY THE GUN OF A SECURITY OFFICER ON DUTY AT PETITIONER'S
COMPOUND, AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT AT WORK ON THE DAY HE SUSTAINED THE INJURY
(GUNSHOT WOUND) WHICH CAUSED HIS DEATH, SAID DAY, BEING A SUNDAY.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WHETHER THE ORDER DIRECT足ING PETITIONER,
AFTER THE LATTER FAILED TO SEASONABLY SUBMIT THE REQUIRED NOTICE OF
CONTROVERSION ISSUED BY THE ACTING REFEREE AFTER PETITIONER REQUESTED IN OPEN
COURT THAT </span>IT <span style="">BE ALLOWED TO
SUBMIT COUNTER-AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF ITS DEFENSE, HAS THE EFFECT OF REINSTATING
PETITIONER'S RIGHT TO CONTROVERT THE CLAIM.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering that there
was </span><span style="">no valid <span class="SpellE">controver<span style="">sion</span></span></span><span style=""> of the </span><span style="">claim </span><span style="">of private
respondents in this case, the Court feels that there would be no need of resolving
the other </span><span style="">issue </span><span style="">as to whether </span>the death <span style="">of the </span><span style="">deceased </span>is <span style="">compensable
under the Workmen's Compensation Act as </span><span style="">amended, </span><span style="">although the
same was due to a gunshot wound sustained by him while trying to wrest forcibly
the gun of the Security Officer on duty at </span><span style="">petitioner's compound and although </span><span style="">he was not at work on the day he sustained
the injury (gunshot wound) which caused his death said day, being a
Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no valid <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim of private r</span><span style="">esp</span><span style="">ondent because the Employer's Report which embodies the notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> was </span><span style="">filed </span><span style="">almost nine (9)
months late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Sec. 45 of the
Workmen's Compensa</span><span style="">tion </span>Act,
<span style="">as </span><span style="">amended, in case the employer decided to </span>controvert the right to
compensation, he shall, either on or before the 14th day of disability or
within 10 <span style="">days after he has knowledge
of the alleged accident, file a notice to the Commission that compensation is
not being paid and the reason why it is not being paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </span>is <span style="">called the Notice of <span class="SpellE">Controversion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that </span>the <span style="">Notice of Death and Claim for Compensation
was filed on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="8"><span style="">August 7, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> but the Notice of <span class="SpellE">Controversion</span>
was filed only on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="5"><span style="">May 7, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
only that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Notice of <span class="SpellE">Controversion</span> also failed to specify in clear terms the
ground for <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been consistently held in a long line
of cases that failure on </span>the <span style="">part
of the employer to file a seasonable notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
of the right of the employee to compensation as required by Section 45 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, constitutes </span>a <span style="">waiver by operation of law of his right to
controvert the employee's claim for compensation on non-jurisdictional grounds
and such <span style="">legal </span>effect does not
violate the requirements of due <span style="">process.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Failure of
employer to controvert is a </span><span style="">renunciation
of the right to challenge the claim and a waiver of <span style="">all </span>non-jurisdictional defenses and there is nothing that the
employer can legally prove in relation thereto</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">It
</span><span style="">is not therefore correct to say
that res</span><span style="">pondent </span><span style="">Commission </span><span style="">committed grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that by <span class="SpellE">laches</span> the petitioner was barred from asserting any defense
against the claim of respondent and that the presumption of compensability
prevails in their favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner, however,
submits that although </span>it has failed to seasonably submit <span style="">the </span>required notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, <span style="">the </span>Acting
Referee upon request of petitioner ordered the latter to submit
counter-affidavits within ten (10) days from receipt of private respondent's
affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order requiring it to
submit counter-affidavits, according to petitioner, amounts to a reinstatement
of its right to controvert a claim pursuant to Section 3, Rule 8 of the Rules
of the Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">A </span>reading <span style="">of the cited section will readily suggest
that before an employer or insurance carrier who has failed to controvert the
right to compensation within the period and in the manner prescribed by Section
45 of the Act may have such right reinstated, he must file a petition under
oath with the Unit specifying therein the reasons for its failure to controvert
the right to compensation and the grounds relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records do not </span>show that the
petitioner filed such a formal petition under oath with the Workmen's
Compensation Unit hearing the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
it did was to make an oral motion in open hearing requesting the Acting Referee
that it be allowed to file its counter-affidavits and not to have its right to
controvert reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not give
or specify the reasons why it failed to controvert as required by Section 3,
Rule 8 of the Rules of the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the Acting Referee, therefore, allowed petitioner to file its
counter-affidavits, such permission did not amount to a reinstatement of its
right to controvert because it was not in accordance with the requirements of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case where the hearing
officer even accepted the evidence presented by the petitioner, the Supreme
Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"Mere acceptance by the hearing officer of the evidence presented
did not mean the right to controvert.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law itself provides that only the Commissioner may reinstate the
right to controvert."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Consequently,
<span style="">since </span>the respondent company did
not have </span>the <span style="">right to controvert
because its right to do so had not been legally and validly </span>reinstated, <span style="">the
counter-affidavits </span><span style="">submitted by
it cannot be given any credit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the respondent
Commission is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
costs against petitioner.</p>
