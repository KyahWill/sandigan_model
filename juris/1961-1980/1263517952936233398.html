				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal, taken by the Solicitor General, from <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, author</span>izing that the name of one Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong be changed to Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span>
Kin.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">The record shows that on June
29, 1966, Ma <span class="SpellE">Ing</span> <span class="SpellE">Chao</span>
filed, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">with said Court, a petition
for the aforementioned change of name, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">upon
the ground that, prior thereto, said petitioner had adopted </span><span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong, a minor, then 4 years of age; that the order,
dated <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">September 11, 1953, granting the
petition for adoption, in Special </span>Civil Case No. 327 of said Court,
directed that, thereafter, his <span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">surname shall
be Ma, which is that of the adopting father; that </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the full name of the adopted minor should,
therefore, be Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> </span>Tong; that his Alien
Certificate of Registration No. A-202752, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">issued
on September 25, 1953, is, however, in the name of Ma </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">Chik</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;"> Kin; that since the minor began schooling in 1955,
he had </span>been using the name Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin and is
known by that name by his friends and schoolmates; that petitioner had
"lately x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
discovered," before the institution of the present case, that such name is
not in accordance with the aforesaid order of adoption <span style="">dated September 11, 1953; and that petitioner wants his adopted son to
"continue using t he name, Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin, not only
because it is the name by which he is commonly known to his friends, acquaintances
and schoolmates, but, also, because it is the name appearing in his alien
registration certificate, otherwise known as ACR No. <span class="GramE">V-54813,
issued on </span></span><st1:date year="1953" day="8" month="5"><span class="GramE"><span style="">May 8, 1953</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">."</span></span><span style=""> After publication of the corresponding
notice and due hearing, the lower court issued the order already adverted to,
despite the opposition thereto of the Solicitor General, who, upon the
subsequent denial of his motion for reconsideration, interposed the present
appeal, which <span class="GramE">We</span> find to be well taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, the title of the
case at bar is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the matter of
the change of name of <u>Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin</u>, a
minor." The order of the trial court, directing the publication of the
corresponding notice, bore the same title, which is, also, that of the notice
published accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have, however,
held that the <u>true</u> name of the party whose name is sought to be changed
should be set forth in the title of the case and of the notice published in
connection therewith, and that failure to do so is fatal to the application for
a change of name and precludes the Court from having jurisdiction to entertain
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> v. Republic,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“ x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. The order of publication herein - based on the petition
- was published in 'The <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Times', a weekly
newspaper in <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The title of this case was there printed as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>'In the matter of the change
of name of Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>,
Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>,
petitioner</u>.' But Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>,
the name appearing in the petition, the order of publication, and the
publication itself, is not the true name of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As heretofore stated, his name appearing in
the civil register is merely 'Jesus Ng' without the <span class="SpellE"><u>Yao</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Siong</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The name to be changed, if any, is Jesus Ng-not Jesus Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus results that there is no name to be
changed in the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"It is our view that
this failure in the heading </span>of the application to give the true name
sought to be changed is fundamental; such failure is non-compliance with the <u>strict</u>
requirements of publication; it is fatal; and the court did not acquire
jurisdiction to hear the case."'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Illustrative of the vital importance attached to the inclusion of
the name in the title of the case and in the notice published in connection
therewith is Tan v. Republic.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The name of the applicant therein was <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> S. Tan,
whereas that given in said notice was Jaime S. Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use therein of the letter "<span class="SpellE">i</span>", instead of "y" in <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>
was deemed sufficient to warrant <u>denial</u> of the petition, because ?</p>

<blockquote>"A discrepancy exists in the petition and the published
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas in the published Order
the name of petitioner was spelled Jaime S. Tan; the verified petition spells
his name as <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> S. Tan (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">A-1 to A-3).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Even the affidavit of the publisher of 'La <span class="SpellE">Prensa</span>'
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A), the name appearing is Jaime S.
Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitions for change of name being
proceedings <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>, strict compliance
with the requirements of publication is essential, for it is by such means that
the Court acquires jurisdiction (Aida <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> v.
Republic, 5Z 0. G. No. 9, p. 2928).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the fact that the proceedings is one for change of name, the
defect in the petition and the order, as to the spelling of the name of the
petitioner, is substantial, because it did not correctly identify the party to
said proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor
General has aptly observed -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">' x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. Not only was it misleading to the courts of justice, but
also prejudiced the interests of the general public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By said act, he made, it difficult or
virtually impossible for anyone who might have an adverse interest, to oppose
his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the eyes of the law,
therefore, petitioner has not complied strictly with the legal requirement
regarding publication, thereby rendering the entire proceeding had in the court
below null and void.’"</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As above indicated, the
name given in the title of the case at bar and of the notice published in
connection therewith is Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin, <u>not</u> the <u>true</u>
name of the adopted son of herein petitioner, which, according to the latter,
is either <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong, or Ma Tong, or Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong, Consequently, the appealed deci</span>sion is
null and void for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of the foregoing, the allegations of the petition
have not been duly established.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner introduced the testimony of Vicente Osorio, who stated that
he is the officer-in-charge and acting alien control officer of the immigration
office at <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City; that an alien by the name
of Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong is registered in his office; that the
registration was made <span style="">on the basis of
the adoption papers, Exhibits A and A-1 (which is the order of adoption); that,
on September 25, 1953, Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong was issued an
alien certificate of registration in the name of Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span>
Kin; and that this was due to the fact that Ma <span class="SpellE">Ing</span> <span class="SpellE">Chao</span>, the petitioner herein, had asked the then alien
registration officer, one Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, that the name
registered be that of Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin because he
(petitioner) did not want the child to know that he was not really petitioner's
son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from this testimony, petitioner
introduced no other evidence except Exhibits A and A-1, the order of adoption,
Exhibit B, a <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">photostatic</span></span>
copy of Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin's alien certificate of
registration, and Exhibit C, the affi­davit of publication of the notice
already adverted to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It has not been proven that Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin
is the same <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong, to whom the order of adoption,
Exhibit A, refers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither the
petitioner nor Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin, or any other person, had
taken the witness stand to testify thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, the only witness for petitioner herein, namely,
Vicente <span class="GramE">Osorio,</span> was not competent to furnish said
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he admitted that he
was not the one who typed and prepared the application for registration of Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong; that he does not remember having seen the person
of Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong whose photograph appears on the alien
certificate of registration Exhibit B; and that he is not sure that Exhibit B
was based upon Exhibits A and A-1, because the former is not in accordance with
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Exhibit B was issued
by someone else, not by Osorio, who does not appear to know either Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Tong or Ma <span class="SpellE">Chik</span> Kin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conse­quently, the allegations of the
petition in this case have not been duly established.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby reversed and
judgment shall be entered denying the petition of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Ma <span class="SpellE">Ing</span> <span class="SpellE">Chao</span>, as well as
dismissing the same, with costs against said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>
