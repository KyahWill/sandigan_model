which affirmed the decision dated. December 23, 1961 and the resolution <u>en</u>

the claim of its members for the payment of back wages by respondents

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In effect, the following
grounds are relied upon by petitioner in its motion for reconsideration, to
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That all conditions required by
this Court to entitle strikers to back pay have been complied with;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That the issuance by this Court of
the injunction order enjoining enforcement of the return-to-work order of the
CIR is not sufficient justifica­tion for denying the claim for back wages;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(4)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR"><span class="GramE">That</span>
respondents PHILSTEAM and MADRIGAL and not members of peti­tioner should be the
ones to suffer for their acts of omission and com­mission.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the first ground, petitioner argues that
taking into consideration (1) that the strike was legal; (2) that the
return-to-work order and other implementing orders and resolutions of the CIR
were valid and lawful; (3) that the strikers were entitled to reinstatement as
a matter of right; and (4) that the strikers not only manifested their
willingness to abide by the CIR back-to-work order but also actually offered
unconditionally to return and even sought the aid of competent authorities to
effect such a return - the conclusion is inescapable that the strikers were entitled
to reinstatement as of the date they unconditionally offered to return to work,
and when they were refused reinstatement they acquired the status of illegally
dismissed or locked-out employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
such, petitioner contends, the strikers are entitled not only to reinstatement
but also to back <span class="GramE">wages</span> from the time they
unconditionally offered to return to work in obedience to the CIR resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it cannot be said that
the return-to-work order and other implementing orders and resolutions of the
CIR were valid and lawful, for if they were so, this Court would not have
enjoined the enforcement of such orders and reso­lutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the offer to return to work
was predicated upon the CIR order and that the enforcement of said order was
permanently enjoined by this Court, the strikers cannot claim that they were
entitled to reinstate­ment as of the date they offered to return to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fur­thermore, the CIR found that "none
of the companies had discriminately rejected their (strikers') application for
reemployment".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such finding is
conclusive upon this Court, the same being supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second ground, petitioner insists that all
conditions required by this Court to en­title strikers to back pay have been
complied with, to wit: (1) the legality of the strike against PHILSTEAM and
MADRIGAL was already adjudged with finality; (2) there was an unconditional
offer to return to work when the strikers manifested their willingness to abide
by the CIR back-to-work order and even sought the aid of com­petent authorities
to effect their return; and (3) the strikers were refused reinstatement, the
most eloquent proof of which is the fact that they have not been re­admitted to
their former positions as of the date of the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the finding of the CIR that "none
of the companies had discriminately rejected their (strikers') application for
reemployment" militates against petitioner on this particular ground.
Moreover, as already stated, the offer of the strikers to return was made in
compliance with the return-to-work order of the CIR but its enforcement was
permanently enjoined by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no showing that the strikers renewed their offer after this
Court issued its injunctive order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
true that PMOG re-offered its members to return to work in its Manifestation
dated <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1962</st1:date>,
but then it was made pursuant to the decision of the Trial Court <span style="">which </span>was not yet final in view of the
motions for recon­sideration filed by the COMPANIES and by PMOG.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the third ground relied upon, peti­tioner alleges <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>: (1) that there are
indications that this Court in issuing the permanent injunction was impressed
by the contention of the respondent COMPANIES that the CIR had no right and
authority to issue the return-­to-work order, which contention was allegedly
rejected in <span class="SpellE">Feati</span> University vs. Bautista (G. R. Nos.
L-21278, 21462 <span style="">&amp; </span>21500,
December 27, 1966); (2) that from the tenor and import of the last paragraph of
this Court's resolution of March 25, 1955, the injunction was without prejudice
to whatever might be the ultimate decision in the cases filed in the CIR; and
(3) that the parties who sought the injunc­tion made this Court understand that
the strikers could be entitled to back wages should the right to reinstatement
be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations of petitioner are devoid of factual basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1955" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1955</st1:date>, which declared the
preliminary <span class="GramE">injunction</span> previously issued permanent
reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"In G. R. No.</span> L-8802, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Seamen's Association Inc. vs. Modesto Castillo, et

<blockquote>"This resolution shall not be under­stood as in any way
preventing the Court of Industrial Relations from proceeding with the hearing
of these cases on the merits with a view to their prompt and final
determination."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that in declaring the preliminary injunction
permanent this Court did not only consider the fact that the existence of the
power of the CIR to issue a back-to-work order under Section 10 of Republic Act
875 was not expressly granted but also other facts, some of which did not exist
in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Feati</u></span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the back-to-work order
was issued by the CIR without hearing all the parties concerned, particularly
the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Seamen's Associa­tion, Inc., while in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Feati</u></span> case, the return-to-work order of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1963</st1:date> was a confirmation of
an agreement between the University and the Faculty Club during a pre-hearing
con­ference on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the last consideration (e)
mentioned in the resolution did not exist in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Feati</u></span>
case. Moreover, the resolution quoted above finally settled the issue in the
cases mentioned therein, namely, the legality of the CIR order sought to be
restrained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be subject to
question now on the ground that the Court had been misled by the contentions of
the respondents COMPANIES.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last paragraph of the resolution is clear and
unequivocal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the context
thereof can be taken to mean as enjoining the CIR from taking into account the
injunction issued by this Court in deciding the merits of the cases before
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is but an authorization for the
CIR to proceed with the hearing of the cases on the merits with a view to their
prompt and final determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the allegation that this Court was made to understand
that the strikers could be entitled to back wages should the right to
reinstatement be upheld, the resolution itself belies it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there were such under­standing it would
have been incorporated in the said reso­lution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, it may be noted that the manifestations to that effect were not
made by respondents MADRIGAL and PHILSTEAM but by MOAP and MARITIMA; hence,
said manifesta­tions are not binding on respondents MADRIGAL AND PHILSTEAM.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, in denying the claim for back wages of the strikers, the
CIR considered not only the permanent injunction but also the events that
transpired from the time the case was certified by the President to the CIR on <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1955</st1:date> up to the time this
Court issued said injunction on <st1:date year="1955" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1955</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fourth ground, petitioner contends that in view of the
erroneous stand of respondents regarding the legality of the strike and the
power and authority of the CIR to issue the return-to-work order, the strikers
were not only deprived of their jobs but also suffered con­siderable damage in
the form of salaries and wages which they failed to earn during the period they
were illegally deprived of their means of livelihood; that justice, equity and
the substantial merits of the case demand that the <span style="">strikers should be compensated such damage; and that the two
respondents could have avoided incurring liability in the form of back wages by
reinstating the strikers after they unconditionally offered to return to work,
subject only to the reservation that they could be dismissed in the event that
the strike was declared illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's arguments are untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the stand of respondents PHILSTEAM AND
MADRIGAL regarding the legality of the strike was adjudged erroneous, their
stand regarding the issuance of the return-to-work order of the CIR was
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already pointed out, the
resolution of March 25, 1955 finally adjudicated the issue regarding the
validity and legality of the CIR back-to-work order when the preliminary
injunction was declared permanent, and the CIR, after considering the incidents
that took place from the time this case reached the said Court up to the time
this Court permanently enjoined the enforcement of the back-to­-work order,
said:</p>

<blockquote>"It will thus be seen, that in the last analysis, the
Companies are not to blame for their failure to rehire the strikers after the
issuance of the <span style="">Court's back-to-work
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, although those
employees, except some <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span> strikers, should be
reinstated, inasmuch as none of the Companies had dis­criminatorily rejected
their application for reemployment, the Court finds, and so holds, that they
are not entitled to the back salaries claimed in their be­half.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim should be, as it is here­by
denied."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, under the particular circumstances
of this case, it would be unfair and unjust to require respondents MADRIGAL and
PHILSTEAM to pay the back wages of the strikers.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this resolution on the merits of the motion for
reconsideration, we deem it no longer necessary to rule expressly on the Motion
to Dismiss Appeal filed by respondent MADRIGAL.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motion for reconsideration is hereby
denied.</p>
