				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Hon. 
Bonifacio Ysip, presiding, sentencing the defendant Philippine Milling Company 
to pay the plaintiff Hap Hong Hardware Co., Inc. the sum of P2,084.90 plus legal 
interest, and the sum of P400.00 as attorney's fees.
<p>The action was brought to recover the value of hardware materials ordered by 
the defendant from the plaintiff which it promised to pay upon delivery. The 
materials were delivered, but only P200.00 was paid at the time of the delivery, 
thus leaving a balance of P2,084.90. After a denial of a motion for a bill of 
particulars and of a motion to dismiss, the defendant filed an answer, admitting 
the purchase by it of the materials and the payment thereon of P200.00, but 
denying the allegation that the balance of P2,084.90 has not been paid. The 
answer also contains a counterclaim for attorney's fees and for moral damages in 
the amount of P5,000.00, alleged as a result of the filing of the action.</p>
<p>The original complaint bears date of April 3, 1956, and the answer to 
defendant's counterclaim was filed on May 29, 1956. On the same date, a motion 
to set the case for hearing was presented by attorney for the plaintiff, and in 
accordance therewith the court set the case for trial on July 19, 1956. However, 
the judge presiding in the sala in which the case was pending was on vacation, 
so counsel for the plaintiff again asked that the case be set for another 
hearing, and in accordance therewith the court set the case for trial on October 
25, 1956. On October 22, 1956, counsel for the defendant moved for a 
postponement of the trial, which the court granted in open court on October 25, 
1956, setting the trial on December 6, 1956.</p>
<p>On December 4, 1956, the defendant again filed a motion for postponement, 
alleging that the officers of the defendant company were attending another 
trial, of a criminal case, and that counsel had to attend also to a trial of 
another criminal case. The motion is sworn to, so the court postponed the 
hearing to January 3, 1957, in an order dated December 6, 1956.</p>
<p>On January 3, 1957, the date of the trial, the defendant again filed a 
petition for postponement, alleging that the defendant's witnesses, officers of 
the company, had not come because it was already the beginning of the milling 
season in the municipality of San Jose, Mindoro Occidental, and their presence 
in the central was very necessary. This motion is dated December 29, 1956 but a 
copy thereof was received by the attorney for the plaintiff only on January 2, 
1957.</p>
<p>When the case was called for hearing on January 3, 1957, the defendant failed 
to appear, and so the court ordered the plaintiff to present its evidence. On 
that same date, the court rendered the judgment appealed from.</p>
<p>Appeal was taken directly to the Court of Appeals, which court endorsed it to 
Us for decision, as the appellant's brief does not raise questions of fact, but 
only a question of law. It is its contention on this appeal that the lower court 
erred in not granting the postponement, as prayed for by the defendant, and in 
allowing the plaintiff to present its evidence, thus depriving appellant of its 
day in court.</p>
<p>We find the appellant's contention to be without merit. Various postponements 
were secured by the defendant prior to the last day set for the hearing, showing 
an intention of defendant's part to delay the termination of the case. Its 
answer shows that it has no apparent defense; it even admitted purchasing the 
materials and in paying only P200.00 upon delivery. The defense is a mere denial 
of the allegation of the plaintiff that the balance of the account has not been 
paid.</p>
<p>The reason adduced in support of the motion for postponement is not 
unavoidable and one that could not have been foreseen. Defendant ought to have 
known long before the date of trial that the milling season would start when the 
trial of the case would be held. The motion should have been presented long in 
advance of the hearing, so that the court could have taken steps to postpone the 
trial without inconvenience to the adverse party. As it is, however, the motion 
was presented on the day of the trial. Knowing as it should have known that 
postponements lie in the court's discretion and there being no apparent reason 
why the defendant could not have presented the motion earlier, thus avoiding 
inconvenience to the adverse party, the appellant can not claim that the trial 
court erred in denying postponement. Under all the circumstances we hold that 
the court was perfectly justified in denying the motion for postponement.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appeal is hereby dismissed, and decision appealed from is 
hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, 
Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and 
<i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
