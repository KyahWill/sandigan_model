restrain respondents, the Secretary of Labor, the Director of Labor Relations

cancellation of the registration certificate of the Social Security System
Employees Association - hereinafter referred to as the SSSEA which is
affiliated to the Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions - hereinafter
referred to as PAFLU - as well as to annul all proceedings in connection with
said cancellation and to prohibit respondents from enforcing Section 23 of
Republic Act No. 875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners,
likewise, pray for a writ of preliminary injunct­ion pending the final

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1963</st1:date>, the Registrar of Labor Organizations - hereinafter <span style="">referred </span>to as the Registrar - issued <span style="">a </span>notice of hearing, on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1963</st1:date>, of the matter of
cancellation <span style="">of the registration of the
SSSEA, because of:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

affidavits which its treasurer or treasurers rendered to said union and its

constitution and by-laws."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">in violation of Section 23 of Republic
Act No. 875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the SSSEA moved
to postpone the hearing to <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1963</st1:date>, and to sub­mit then a memorandum, as well as the
documents specified in the notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion was granted, but, nobody appeared for the SSSEA on the date last
mentioned. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The next day, <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1963</st1:date>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Villagracia</span>, Assistant Secretary of the SSSEA, filed, with

<p class="BODY">Holding</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the joint non-subversive affidavit and
the list of officers mentioned in the letter of Mr. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Villagracia</span>
were not the documents referred to in the notice of hearing and made the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1963</st1:date>, the Registrar rendered a decision <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the <span class="SpellE">SSSEA’s</span>
Registration Certificate No. <span style="">1-1P-169, </span>issued
on <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon later, or on October 28, 1963, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, pre­sident of the SSSEA moved for a
reconsideration of said decision and prayed for time, up to November 15, within
which to submit the requisite papers and data.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An opposition thereto having been filed by one <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Escueta</span>, a member of the SSSEA, upon the ground that
the latter had never submitted any financial statement to its members, said
motion was heard on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1963</st1:date>, the Registrar issued an order
declaring that the SSSEA had "failed to submit the following requirements
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Non-subversive affidavits of Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Zalameda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> and Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Pefianco</span> who were elected along with others on January 30,
1962.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Names, postal addresses and non-subversive
affidavits of all the officers who were supposedly elected on October (1st
Sunday), of its constitution and by-laws."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and granting the SSSEA 15 days from
notice to comply with said re­quirements, as well as meanwhile holding in
abeyance the resolution of its motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending such resolution, or on December 16, the PAFLU, the SSSEA,
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> "and all the officers and
members" of the SSSEA commenced the present action, for the purpose stated
at the beginning of this decision, upon the ground that Section 23 of Republic
Act No. 875 violates their freedom of assembly and association, and is
inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; that it unduly
delegates judicial power to an administrative agency; that said Section 23
should be deemed repealed by ILO-Convention No. 87; that respondents have acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion in
promulgating, on November 19, 1963, its decision dated October 22, 1963, beyond
the 30-day period provid­ed in Section 23(c) of Republic Act No. 875; that
"there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the
ordinary course of law"; that the decision complained of had not been
approved by the Secretary of Labor; and that the cancellation of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">SSSEA's</span></span><span style=""> </span>certifi­cate
of registration would cause irreparable injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory to the effect that Section 23 of Republic Act No. 875
unduly curtails the freedom of assembly and association guaranteed in the Bill
of Rights is devoid of factual basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The registration pres­cribed in paragraph (b) of said section<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is not a limitation to the right <span style="">of
assembly or association, which <u>may be</u> exercised with or <u>without</u>
said registration.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a><span style=""> The latter is merely a condition <u>sine</u>
<u>qua</u> <u>non</u> for the <u>acquisition of legal personality</u> by labor
organizations, asso­ciations or unions and the possession of the "rights
and privileges granted by law to legitimate labor organizations." The
Constitution does not guarantee these rights and privileges, much less said per­sonality,
which are mere <u>statutory</u> creations, for the possession and exercise of
which registration is required to protect both labor and the public against
abuses, fraud, or impostors who pose as organi­zers, although not truly
accredited agents of the union they purport to represent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such requirement is a valid exercise of the
police power, because the activities in which labor organizations, associa­tions
and union of workers are engaged affect public interest, which should be
protected.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span style=""> Furthermore, the obligation to submit finan­cial statements, as a
condition for the non-cancellation of a certificate of registration, is a
reasonable regulation for the benefit of the mem­bers of the organization,
considering that the same generally solicits funds or membership, as well as
oftentimes collects, on behalf of its members, huge amounts of money due to
them or to the organiza­tion.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the same reasons, said Section 23 does not impinge upon the
right of organization guaranteed in the Declaration of Human Rights, or run
counter to Articles 2, 4, 7 and Section 2 of Article 8 of the ILO-Convention
No. 87, which provide that "workers and em­<span style="">ployers, </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">shall have
the right to establish and </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">join
organizations of their own choosing, without previous authorization;" that
"workers and employers organizations shall not be liable to be dis­solved
or suspended by administrative authority;" that "the acquisi­tion of
legal personality by workers' and employers' organizations, </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">shall not be made subject to conditions of such
a character as to restrict the application of the provisions" above
mentioned; and that "the guarantees provided for in" said Convention
shall not be impaired by the law of the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In B.S.P. v. Araos<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>, we held
that there is no incompatibility between Republic Act No. 875 and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the <span style="">other hand, the cancellation </span>of the <span class="SpellE">SSSEA's</span> registration certificate would not <span style="">entail a dissolution of said association or </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">suspension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span><u><span style="">existence</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the SSSEA would not be </span>affected by
said cancellation, although its juridical personality and its statutory rights
and privileges - as distinguished from those conferred by the Constitution -
would be suspended thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be registered, pursuant to Section 23 (b) of Republic Act No.
875, a labor organization, association or union of workers must file with the
Department of Labor the following documents:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the constitution and by-laws of the
organization together with a list of all officers of the association, their
addresses and the address of the principal office of the organization;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sworn statement of all the officers of the
said organization, association or union to the effect that they are not members
of the Communist Party and that they are not members of any organization which
teaches the overthrow of the Government by force or by any illegal or
unconstitutional method; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the applicant organization has been in existence for one or more years, a copy
of its last annual financial report."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, paragraph (d) of said Section ordains that:</p>

<blockquote>"The registration and permit of a legitimate labor
organization <u>shall be cancelled</u> by the Depart­ment of Labor, if the
Department has reason to be­lieve that the labor organization <u>no longer
meets one or more of the requirements of paragraph (b) above</u>; or <u>fails
to </u><u><span style="">file</span></u> with the
Department of Labor either its <u>financial report</u> within the sixty days of
the end of its fiscal year or the <u>names of its new officers</u> along <u>with
their non-subversive affidavits</u> as outlined in paragraph; (b) above within
sixty days of their election; however, the Department of Labor shall not order
the cancellation of the registration and permit without due notice and hearing,
as provided under paragraph (c) above, and the affected labor organization
shall have the same right of appeal to the courts as previously provided."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The determination of the question whether the requirements of
paragraph (b) have been met, or, whether or not the requisite financial report
or non-subversive affidavits have been filed within the period above stated, is
not judicial power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, all officers
of the government, including those in the executive department, are supposed to
act on the basis of facts, as they see the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is specially true as regards
administrative agencies given by law the power to investigate and render
decisions concerning details related to the execution of laws the enforcement
of which is entrust­ed thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
speaking for this Court, Mr. Justice Reyes <span style="">(J.B.L.) had occasion to say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The objections of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to
the constitu­tionality of Republic Act No. 2056, not only as an undue
delegation of judicial power to the Secretary of Public Works but also for
being unreasonable and arbitrary, are not tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted that the Act (R.A. 2056)
merely empowers the Secretary to remove unauthorized obstructions or
encroachments upon public streams, constructions that no private person was
anyway entitled to make, because the bed of navigable streams is public
property, and ownership thereof is not acquirable by adverse possession (<span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> vs. Commonwealth, 69 Phil. 449).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is true that the exercise of the Secretary's power under
the Act necessarily involves the <u>determination of some questions of fact</u>,
such as the existence of the stream and <u>its previous navigable character</u>;
but these functions, whether judicial or quasi-judicial, are merely incidental
to the exercise of the power granted by law to clear navigable streams of
unauthorized obstructions or encroachments, and <u>authorities are clear that
they are validly <span class="SpellE">conferable</span> upon executive officials</u>
provided the party affected is given <span style="">opportunity to be </span>heard, as is expressly
required by Republic Act No. 2056, section 2."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, also, that, admittedly, the SSSEA had not
filed the non-subversive affidavits of some of its officers - "Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zalameda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pefianca</span>" -
although said organization avers that these persons "were either resigned
or out on leave as directors or officers of the union," without specify<span style="">ing who had resigned and who were on
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This averment </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">moreover, <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by respondents herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the 30-day period invoked by the petitioners <span style="">is inap­plicable </span>to
the decision complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said period
is prescribed in paragraph (c)<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> of
Section 23, which refers to the proceedings for the "registration" of
labor organizations, associations or unions <u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> to the
"cancellation" of said registration, which is governed by the
above-quoted paragraph (d) of the same section.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of the foregoing, we have repeatedly held that
legal provisions prescribing the period within which a decision should be
rendered are directory, not mandatory in nature - in the sense that, a judgment
promulgated after the expiration of said period is not null and void, although
the officer who failed to comply with law may be dealt with administratively, <span style="">in </span>consequence
of his delays<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> - unless the intention to the
contrary <span style="">is </span>manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such, however, is not the im­port of said
paragraph (c).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Black:</p>

<blockquote>"When a statute specifies the time at or within which an act
is to be done by a public officer or body, it is generally held to be <u><span style="">directory only as to the </span>time</u>, and
not mandatory, unless time is of the essence of the thing to be done, or the
language of the statute contains negative words, or shows that the designation
of the time was intended as a limitation of power, authority or right.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, there is no law requiring the approval, by the Se­cretary
of Labor, of the decision of the Registrar decreeing the can­cellation of a
registration certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
language of para­graph (d) of Section 23 suggests that, once the conditions
therein spe­cified are present, the office concerned "shall" have no
choice but to issue the order of cancellation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, in the case at bar, there is nothing, as yet, for the
Secretary of Labor to approve or disap­prove, since petitioners' motion for
reconsideration of the Registrar's decision of October 23, 1963, <span style="">is </span>still pending resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, this circumstance shows, not only
that the present action is premature<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a>, but,
also, that petitioners have failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available
to them.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> Indeed, they could ask the
Secretary of Labor to disapprove the Registrar's decision or object to its exe­cution
or enforcement, in the absence of approval of the former, if the same were
necessary, on which we need not and do not express any opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of the foregoing</b>, the petition herein should be,
as it is hereby dismissed, and the writs prayed for denied, with costs against
the petitioners.</p>
