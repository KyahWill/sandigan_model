which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span>
<span class="SpellE">Covita</span> and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
guilty beyond rea­sonable doubt of the offense charged and accord­ingly imposes

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1963</st1:date>,
five men, armed with guns and bolos, en­tered the store and house of Cong <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> Hay Ham (hereinafter referred to as Hay Ham) located
in <span class="SpellE">Veruela</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time the following persons were in
the house:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hay Ham, his wife <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> <span class="SpellE">Chamen</span> and his daughter <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the store were Hay Ham's son-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>, Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Veruela</span> and husband of <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span>, Jr., son
of <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> <span class="SpellE">Chamen</span> by a
former marriage, Hay Ham's laborer Tomas Otero, <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span>
Novo, <span class="SpellE">Laurentino</span> Otero and Crispin Romano.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two of the intruders, including the leader, who entered ahead of
their companions, ordered Tomas and <span class="SpellE">Laurentino</span> Otero,
<span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> Novo and Crispin Romano to go into the house,
and once the latter four were inside, they were told not to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laurentino</span> Otero,
Crispin Romano and <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> Novo were, however, able
to escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The others were ordered to
lie down on the floor by the leader of the group, and as the intruders were
tying them up, the leader fired his gun, the bullet ricocheting from the floor
and injuring the leg of one of the intruders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>, who was previously sitting in the
corner of a room, was already on the floor, with his hands tied by the
robbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anselma</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chamen</span> was slapped with the blade of a bolo, as a
result of which she became unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After regaining consciousness and while lying flat on the floor, she
pleaded with the intruders not to harm them, telling them to just take what
they wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was, however, rebuked
for talking too much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span> was slapped, beat­en with a gun and kicked several
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The leader of the gang fired his
gun once more and went to the display table, pulled out a drawer, and took <span class="SpellE">there­from</span> money and other valuables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another man, bring­ing a sack, followed
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the leader approached Hay Ham
and, holding him by the back of his collar, ordered him to stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hay Ham was not able to stand, for by that
time he had become weakened by the beat­ings inflicted on him by the
intruders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another man dragged him into
his bedroom, followed by another intruder who kept kicking him at the
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hay Ham was thereafter heard to be
groaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the intruders
approached Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>, who was lying on his left
side, pointed his gun toward the judge and pressed the trigger thrice, but the
gun did not fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another member of the
gang got a bolo and hacked the judge several times, and as the latter tried to
evade the blows, he was slashed on the left side of the face, on the back,
right wrist and head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About thirty
minutes later, the robbers left the house, carrying with them their <span class="SpellE">sackful</span> of booty, but one of them fired two shots before
leaving the environs of the house of Hay Ham.</p>

<p class="BODY">After they had gone, Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>, his
wife <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span>
immediately went to Hay Ham's bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There they saw Hay Ham lying prostrate with two big wounds on his
face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His hands were tied, and he was in
critical condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not
talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>
applied some medicine on Hay Ham's wounds and a <span class="SpellE">torniquet</span>
on the wound of Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hay Ham was placed on a motorized <span class="SpellE">banca</span> to be taken to a hospital, but he had already expired
by then.</p>

<p class="BODY">The robbers succeeded in taking away P20,000.00 in cash kept in a
drawer of a table in bills of P50, P20, P10, P5, P2, and <span style="">P1, </span>and small denomina­tions of P0.50,
P0.20, P0.10, and P0.05<span style="">, </span>P50.00 <span style="">in </span>cash
inside a brown bag belonging to <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> <span class="SpellE">Chamen</span>, as well as other articles of value as enumerated in
the Information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the cash amount
taken, P85.20 was later recovered by the authorities, as will be mentioned
hereinafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical certificates show the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i><span style="">Hay
Ham</span></i><span style=""> </span>died of shock and
hemorrhage due to hack wounds in the face (Exhibit "B"); <i><span style="">Judge</span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">Dairo</i></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">sufered</span> a
deep incised wound about seven (7) inches on the left side of the face --- <span class="SpellE">temporo</span> maxillary, a superficial incised wound <span style="">on </span>the left cheek about three (3)
inches, and two sliced wounds about one (1) inch of the scalp at the occipital
region (Exh­ibit "A"); <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Anselma</span></i></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><i>Chamen</i></span> </span>suffered a lesion on the right
temporal region, with <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span>, as big as a closed
fist of a three-month old baby, which was expected to heal from four (4) to
seven (7) days (Exhibit "C"); and <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Pacita</span></i></span><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>suffered a contusion on the right
occipital region, another contusion on the right <span class="SpellE">periorbital</span>
region, a laceration of two (2) inches at the scalp, right occipital region,
with an expected healing period of three (3) weeks.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1963</st1:date>,

o'clock in the evening, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Veruela</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the herein accused, armed with fire­arms
and bolos, conspiring together with John Doe and Peter Doe, with intent of
gain, and by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously enter into the house
of Cong <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> Hay Ham at the afore­mentioned place
and take, steal and carry away <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> a cash
amount of P20,000.00, a bag worth P8.50 containing a wrist watch worth P45.00
and a cash amount of P50.00, all belonging to Cong <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
Hay Ham, to the damage and prejudice of the latter in the aggregate sum of
P20,103.50, and on the occasion and by reason of said robbery, the said
accused, confabulating together with John Doe and Peter Doe and mutually
helping one another, with intent to kill and with treachery and evident
premeditation, then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully
and feloniously attack, assault and stab with bo­los Cong <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
Hay Ham, thereby inflicting upon <span style="">the
latter mortal wounds which directly caused his death, and <span class="SpellE">Julito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>, inflicting upon the latter serious wounds
which would ordinarily produce death, thus performing all the acts of exe­cution
which would produce the crime of homicide as a consequence but which,
nevertheless, did not produce it because the weapon used met obstructions in
the victim's body and by reason of competent medical treatment rendered on him,
and struck <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> <span class="SpellE">Chamen</span> with blunt

<blockquote>"The testimonial evidence presented by the prosecution coupled
with his own admissions esta­blished beyond the shadow of doubt accused <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita's</span> participation in
the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His close association
with his co-accused before, during and after the commission of the offense, his
admittedly direct participation in the performance of acts resulting in the
accomplishment of their evil purpose, his concealment of his share of its loot
(Session of Sept. 15, 1965, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. 116-122), his
failure or refusal to voluntarily surrender to the authorities <span style="">(<i>Ibid</i>.) </span>negate his belated pre­tension
he was deceived and/or forced into com­mitting the robbery-killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court cannot simply bring itself to
believe <span class="SpellE">Covita's</span> story he permitted three men (his
co-accused <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> Sua­rez, <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
Suarez, and alias Cano) whom accor­ding to him, he hardly knew, and who were
armed with deadly weapons, to stay in his house one day and one night, and, on
the following day, accom­panied them, ostensibly to buy land in a totally
strange place miles away from home, only to find himself involved in a
robbery-killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, this
evinces a community of purpose, and that each of the accused knew of the
criminal de­sign of the others as can be sufficiently inferred from the
attendant circumstances, such as their arrival at <span class="SpellE">Veruela</span>
at the same time, their pre­sence from the commencement up to the consummation
of the crime, and most important of all, the fact they acted in concert all
throughout its commis­sion pursuant to the same evident objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Peo­ple vs. <span class="SpellE">Agrava</span>,

vs. <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span>, 37 Phil. 599)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the defendant-appellant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, the trial court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Apart from the positive identification of the accused <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> by the prosecution eyewitnesses <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span>,
Otero, and <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span> during the trial, several
circumstances militate strongly against <span class="SpellE">Maca's</span>
inherently weak defense of alibi:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1) in his
affidavit, Exhibit E, he swore having reached his house at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>
from <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span> on January 18, 1963; his repudiation of
this and other statements contained in his affidavit during the <span style="">trial is a defensive afterthought (Ses­sion
of May 24, 1966; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 78-82);</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">2) </span>at one point during the robbery, <span class="SpellE">Maca's</span> white handkerchief mask slid down his face enabling
the eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span>
to recognize him under the bright <span class="SpellE">Petromax</span> lamp
(Session of March 24, 1965; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 12-18);</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3) by his own
admission, shortly after the commission of the offense charged, he was with the
accused <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> Suarez, <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Suarez,
and alias Cano, among others; on February 1, 1963, rural policeman Jose <span class="SpellE">Dadong</span> saw him with the aforesaid accused, among others, on
the <span class="SpellE">Masayan</span> trail; on February 2, 1963, Jose <span class="SpellE">Dadong</span> saw him again with the same group at <span class="SpellE">Dadong's</span> farm digging for <span class="SpellE">camo­tes</span>
(Session of July 29, 1965; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. pp. 90-94); earlier
on the same day, the very identical group was surprised by barrio lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Belano</span> at Triumph
Timber Corporation's logging camp at <span class="SpellE">Kaigangan</span>,
Loreto, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>; Rod­rigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
lied to <span class="SpellE">Belano</span> when he told the latter his group had
been to <span class="SpellE">Masayan</span> to plant rice (Session of July 29,
1965; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 54-56);</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4) despite his
knowledge of the commission of the offense charged and the perpetrators
thereof, he made no effort to re­port the incident to the authorities until he
was arrested; in fact, the aid and comfort he gave the perpetrators contributed
to the escape of three of them who, to this date, are still at large;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5) the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> testimony, on direct and cross-examination of
Corporal <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Magturtur</span>
of the 97th PC Co., <span class="SpellE">Punawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>,
is to the effect that Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> confessed to him
and his Command­ing Officer, <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> was one of the five
persons who had robbed the residence of Hay Ham on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1963</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30 P.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Session
of September 15, 1963; <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 119-120; 124-131).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above-specified circumstances coupled with his positive
identification erase any doubt in the mind of this Court with respect to the
guilt <span style="">of </span>Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The vicarious testimony of his brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> (a confessed
participant) seek­ing to bolster Rodrigo's defense of alibi deserves little
credence; much less the understandably biased testimony of his father,
Silvestre, and his sister, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can the self-serv­ing letters
(Exhibits 4, 4-A-Maca) nor the hear<span style="">say
reply letter (Exhibit 6-Maca) be of any deci­sive assistance."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that the commission of the crime was attended
by the aggravating circums­tances of band and treachery, without any mitigat­ing
circumstance to offset them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
impo­sition of the supreme penalty on defendants-appel­lants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> testified that on
January 29, 1963, three persons, namely, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
Suarez, <span class="SpellE">Ludo­vico</span> Suarez and someone called Cano, all
armed with bolos, arrived at his house at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>,
Johnson, Loreto, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>; that they brought with them
a hand­bag and a sack purportedly containing clothes and other personal effects;
that the three men requested him to accompany them to <span class="SpellE">Lugom</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, where they allegedly wanted to see a parcel
of land which they were contemplating to buy; that in the morning of January
30, 1963, he, armed with a hunting knife, together with the men, left his
house; that when they reached <span class="SpellE">Veruela</span> at about 6:30
o'clock in the evening, he made inquiries from his companions about the land
which they were intending to buy; that the three men pulled out their firearms
from the hand­bag -- <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Suarez, a rifle; <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Suarez, a shotgun; and Cano, a .38 Caliber
revolver -- and Cano then told him that their intention was not to buy land but
to rob a Chinaman; that he (appellant) told them that had they informed him
earlier of their plan, he would not have gone with them; that Cano pointed his
revolver at him, asking him whether he preferred to go with them or to be
killed by Cano; that because of this, he became afraid and had no alternative
but to go with the men; that <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Suarez ordered
him and the other two men to go up Hay Ham's house and rob the place; that when
they were already in the second floor of the house, <span class="SpellE">File­mon</span>
Suarez ordered the persons inside "'Wag <span class="SpellE">kayong</span> <span class="SpellE">kikilos</span>" and made them lie on the floor; that he
(appellant) was ordered by <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> to tie the hands of the persons whom they found in
the house but he refused thrice, and the third time he refused, a shot was
fired at him by <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Suarez, as a result of which
he was hit on the right foot; that he went to the balcony of the house and
there tried to stop his wound from bleeding; that while he was in the balcony,
he saw <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Suarez stand­ing guard outside the
house, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Suarez entering Hay Ham's room, and
Cano tying the inmates' hands; that <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> demanded
money from Hay Ham and when the latter refused, <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
entered and hacked Hay Ham with a bolo; that <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
then came out of the room, aimed his gun at Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>,
and pressed the trigger, but it did not fire, so he (<span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>)
un­sheathed his bolo and hacked the judge; that he (appellant) went down from
the house in order to escape, but because of the pain in his right foot, he had
to rest for a while, and it was while he was resting that his three companions,
who were then fleeing from the Chinaman's house, overtook him; that he pleaded
with them to bring him to his house at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>;
that his companions carried him, and when they had gone a little farther away
from <span class="SpellE">Verue­la</span>, they found a man who assisted them in
carrying him on a hammock; that he sent <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
Suarez and Cano to his (appellant's) house at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>
to notify his family of his condition; that as a re­sult, his wife, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, his father-in-law,
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, and his brother-in-law, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> (the other appellant <span style="">in </span>this case), came to him in the mountain where he was lying
wounded; that the said relatives, together with <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
Suarez, <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Suarez and Cano, helped one another
in carrying him on the hammock to <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>, which
they reached on February 5, 1963; that he was taken to a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>,
where they hid him; that on February 6, 1963, he became aware of the fact that
a PC pat­rol was at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span> looking for the
robbers; and that he stayed in the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> until
February 9, 1963, when PC soldiers arrived.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>
thus admits his pre­sence at the scene of the crime at the time of its
commission, but denies having acted in conspiracy with the other accused
because he was misled by <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Suarez, <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Suarez and Cano into accom­panying them to <span class="SpellE">Lugom</span> to see a parcel of land which the three wanted to
buy, but when they reached <span class="SpellE">Veruela</span>, he was forced by
them through threats to participate in the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contends that the fact that he was shot by
one of the men proves that he was present as an unwilling member of the group,
and that, if at all, his participation merely con­sisted in pointing a gun at
some of the inmates of the house, which is not punishable by death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The flaw in appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita's</span> theory
is that it leaves many vital questions unanswered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why, for instance, would he accompany the
three persons to <span class="SpellE">Lugom</span> when according to him he
himself did not know where that place was?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His wife, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>, tes­tified that her
husband told her that the first to enter Hay Ham's house were <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Sua­rez, the
next, Cano, and the last, appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the last to enter the house, <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> could have escaped had he wanted to, as some of the
persons who were then in the house — <span class="SpellE">Laurentino</span>
Otero, Crispin Romano and <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> Novo — were able to
do, considering, especially, that he was, by his own admission, armed with a
hunting knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> would make capital of the fact that he was wounded
by one of his companions because he refused to participate in the commission of
the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was, however, belied
by Tomas Otero who testi­fied that <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> was wounded
when the bullet from the riot gun fired by one of the culprits towards the
floor ricocheted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, if appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> was an unwilling member, why did he hide from the
authorities in a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>
until <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1963</st1:date>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the evidence for
appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> shows that after the robbery, his
companions attended to him with solicitude, carrying him to the mountain,
notifying his family of his wounded condition, helping his relatives carry him
to <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span> and hiding him in a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>
was likewise armed which would not have been the case if he joined the group
under duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is the money in
the amount of P85.20 in a tin can hidden under the ground beneath a tree at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span> some fifteen (15) meters away from the house of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita's</span> father-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was dug up by the PC soldiers upon the
information given to them by appellant <span class="SpellE">Covita's</span> wife
that the money was hidden there by her husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No explanation at all was given on the witness stand by <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> why he had hidden this money although it appears
clear from the evidence that the prosecution had always considered the money as
part of <span class="SpellE">Covita's</span> share <span style="">in </span>the loot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
foregoing reasons and in view of the substantial evidence for the prosecution,
We find that <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>
was in­deed one of the participants in the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of defendant-appellant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
is in a different situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, in his affidavit, appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
stated that he arrived in his house at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>,

<span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="1">January

his arrival was <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his brief, appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
admits that there is a discrepancy between his affidavit and his testimony in
court regarding the date of his arrival at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>,
but he claims that there must have been an error in the drafting of the
affidavit, the con­tents of which were not read to him before he affixed his
signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that the true date
of his departure from <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
was January 25, 1963; that the true date of his arrival at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>
was January 30, 1963; and that in his affidavit, he declared that he left <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> on January 18,
1963 and arrived at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span> on January 18, 1963,
which could not be the case unless he <span class="SpellE">travelled</span> by

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To the question of when he arrived at <span class="SpellE">Penalisan</span>, appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
answered in his affidavit that the date of his arrival was <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also stated in said affidavit that his companion on the <span style="">trip was one Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Espulgar</span>;

the circumstance that appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca's</span> white

to recognize him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three of the eyewitnesses, namely, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span> declared that appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> was one of the five persons who participated in the
robbery; that he had known <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> de la Cruz, who
acted as leader of the group, for about five (5) years before the incident, for
De la Cruz used to buy from Hay Ham's store and once even had an alter­cation
with Hay Ham; that he did not know the other persons who were with De la Cruz,
but he could re­cognize them if he saw them again; that it was <span class="SpellE">Ono­fre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> and Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> who ordered <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> Novo,
Tomas Otero, <span class="SpellE">Laurentino</span> Otero and Crispin Romano, who

flat on the floor; that <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> tied Hay Ham's hands; that <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
fired three (3) times at Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span> while the latter
was lying on the left side of his body, but the gun did not fire; and that he
was able to see and remember the faces of the intruders because there was a
bright <span class="SpellE">Petromax</span> light inside the house.</p>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
the incident, I saw <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> de la Cruz several times
in the <span class="SpellE"><i style="">poblacion</i></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Ver­uela</span> and at times in the store purchasing
supplies while this Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> and <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>, I saw them only
for the first time in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1963</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How did you happen to immediately
identify the persons who entered in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1963</st1:date> that they were Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> and <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span> if you only knew them at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I was there lying down
hogtied, I was staring at the face of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
and I observed his face, the nature of his cars and I was staring at his
expression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>, I noticed that he
has a beard on his chin and he was bald-headed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is it not a fact that you only came
to know these two merely at the time they were already accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A. -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When I came back from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
I went immediate­ly to the headquarters and while I was sit­ting in the Office
of the Commanding Offi­cer inside, a person came to the amphithea­ter acting as
a janitor and I recognized him immediately to be one of those who robbed us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When was that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was sometime in March, and I
easily recognized and identified him to be one of those who came up in the
store <span style="">in the </span>evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1963</st1:date>." (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 180-­181, Session of <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1965</st1:date>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> places much stress on
the variances or inconsistencies in the witnesses' description of the
handkerchiefs used as masks by the culprits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, according to <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span>, the
handkerchief was white,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
while in the view of Tomas Otero, it was colored and dotted red.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These differences on impressions on the color
of the handkerchiefs do not detract from the credibility of the afore-stated
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They refer to minor
differences in detail which are not of such magnitude as to impair the
credibility of their testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has ob­served that inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses in
minor details reinforce rather than weaken their credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is usual for witnesses to a stirring event
to see some details of the startling occurrence differently.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the evidence that the store of Hay Ham Lim where
the incident occurred was brightly lighted by a 500-candle <span class="SpellE">Petromax</span>
lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since these eyewitnesses were near
appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, it is not improbable that they
recognized his face, when the handkerchief mask which he was wearing mo­mentarily
slipped down his face, at the time appel­lant was stooping low when he was
tying up Otero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span> recognized <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, not
only on the basis of <span class="SpellE">Maca's</span> physiognomy, but also
because of his height and other physical features, while Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span> recognized him because of the shape of his ears and
the other contours of appel­lant's countenance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span> had every reason to remember
appellant <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> because he stared in­tently at the
appellant after he tried to shoot him thrice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">resumé</span>, therefore, there are facts
and circumstances which establish <span class="SpellE">Maca's</span>
participation in the commission of the crime and militate strongly against his
defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Tomas Otero testified that Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>
tied him up while <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Covita</span>
tied <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span>;
that <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> pointed his revolver at Judge <span class="SpellE">Dairo</span>, fired at the latter, but the gun failed to fire;
that only two of the culprits were masked but he was able to "recognize
them because their masks were brought down when they were * * * hogtying
us."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. According to <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Piencenaves</span>, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> was
wearing a black jacket and a mask (white handkerchief) and at one point during
the robbery, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maca's</span></span><span style=""> handkerchief mask slid down his face

1, 1963, rural policeman Jose <span class="SpellE">Dadong</span> saw him with the
aforesaid accused, among others, on the <span class="SpellE">Masayan</span>

Timber Corporation's logging camp at <span class="SpellE">Kaigangan</span>,
Loreto, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>; Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>

brother-in-law, Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, his father, and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, his sister, to the
effect that he was not among those who perpetrated the offense, for being

<p class="BODY">The crime committed is robbery with homicide, frustrated homicide
and physical injuries, punishable by <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>

by a band, as five of the men were armed with guns and bolos, Article 295 of
