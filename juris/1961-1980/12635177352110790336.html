rendered on July 31, 1964 in its Civil Case No. 21325, dismissed the petition

Application No. 6541; that it acquired these lots from previous applicants long
before the <span style="">last </span>Pacific War;
that it has been the one occupying and cultivating the said lots; and that the
patents granted to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were acquired
between the years 1951 and 1957 when the "ownership and rights acquired
under <span style="">S.A. </span>No. 6541 were under

fraudulently.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">From the indication in the </span><span style="">Records, </span><span style="">it does not appear that the conflict between Sales Application No. 6541
of the </span><span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Agricola</span></span><span style=""> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span>, on one hand, and Homestead

<p class="BODY">Leonardo T. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sinaguinan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ceña</span></span><span style=""> </span>moved separately for the
reconsideration of the foregoing order, alleging that since the lots mentioned
therein were already covered by certificates of <span style="">title issued pursuant </span>to the corresponding homestead patents in
their favor, the same had ceased to be parts of the public domain and hence
were outside the control and jurisdic­tion of the Bureau of Lands or of the
Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1960</st1:date>
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources <span style="">issued </span>an order wherein, after reviewing the history of each of
the homestead applications which led to the issuance of the corresponding
titles, he made the following findings and disposition:</p>

<blockquote>"It will be noted that the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span> <span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span> was already
the <span style="">owner </span>of Lots Nos. 3804,
3805, 3806 and 3810-A (Now Lot No. 4413) long before the last Global War by
lawful acquisition thereof from previous applicants <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of records shows that it never
relinquished its claims thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As a </span>matter of fact, it restated its
claim to those lots on the first opportunity after the said Global War when in
July, 1950, thru its representative in the person of Mrs. Veronica <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Lacalle</span>, it gave notice
to the Bureau of Lands in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> of
its protest against the persons who had manifested and shown interest in
acquiring them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will also be noted
that the homestead applications of Montano Villarama and Felipe Sinaguinan were
filed on the same date, that is, August 30, 1950, while that of Leonardo T.
Joson was filed on August 31, 1950, so that when their applications were filed,
they already knew of the claim of the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span> <span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span> to the
aforementioned lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ceña</span>, he always knew of
the claim of the Partnership <span style="">because </span>he
had long ago sold his rights to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were, therefore, homestead applicants in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances and as the conflict
between Sales Application No. 6541 of the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span> <span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span>, on one hand,
and the aforesaid four homestead applications, on the other, was still pending
determination when the homestead patents were issued, the issuance of those
patents was basically irregular and highly fraudulent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have observed that there was a deliberate intent to hasten
the <span style="">is</span>suance of the homestead
patents, evidently to hoodwink and to catch unaware the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is shown by the approvals of the
applications, which were made retroactive in order to accommodate and make the
final proofs acceptable before the expiration of one year from the said
approvals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the approvals
of the applications of Montano <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sinaguinan</span> were made retroactive <span style="">as </span>of the date of their filing on <st1:date year="1950" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The application of Leonardo T. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> was filed
on <st1:date year="1950" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1950</st1:date>, but the
approval was made retroactive <span style="">as </span>of <st1:date year="1950" day="1" month="5">May
 1, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of
approval, <span style="">in </span>so far as it
refers to the <span class="SpellE">retroactiveness</span> of the date simple
reason that an application cannot be approved before it is filed, acknowledged
and recorded (sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, and
as the common saying goes, 'the water cannot rise higher than its source.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It does not appear, however that the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span> had
filed a petition in court for the cancellation of Original Certificates of
Title Nos. P-196, P-135, P-322 and P-19 issued in favor of Montano <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>, Leonardo T. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sinaguinan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ceña</span>, respectively, within one (1) year from such
issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, these titles are
already irrevocable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now well-settled
rule in this jurisdiction that <span style="">a </span>homestead patent issued in pursuance of
the Public Land Law has the same indefeasibility as that issued under Act No.
496 (otherwise known as the Land Registration Law) after one (1) year from its
issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A certificate of title issued
pursuant to a homestead patent partakes of the nature of <span style="">a certificate
issued as a </span>consequence of a judicial proceeding as long as the land
disposed of <span style="">is
</span>really a part of the public domain and becomes indefeasible and
incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from the date of issuance
thereof." (Lucas vs. Durian, G.R. No. L-7886, promulgated <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1957</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was reinstated by the Supreme
Court in the case of the Director of Lands vs. The Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Carlo, et al., G.R. No. L-2485, promulgated <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1959</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the order entered on these cases on April 11, 1960
is hereby set aside and the Sales Application No. 6541 of the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span> <span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span>, amended by excluding from the land covered thereby
lots Nos. 3804, 3805, 3806 and 3810-A (Now lot No. 4413), <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On November 2, 1960
Leonardo T. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>, for himself and as vendee of
Montano <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> with respect to lot No. 3804, moved
to reconsider the order of August 24, 1960, praying "that the appeal of
the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span> <span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span> re lots 3804 and 3805 be dismissed outright, or, at
least, the order of this office dated August 24, 1960 be amended as to
eliminate therein all holdings, manifestations and conclusions condemning
Montano <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> and Leonardo T. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
as <span class="SpellE">abovestated</span>." The motion was denied in an
order dated </span><st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="12"><span style="">December 21, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, and </span><span class="SpellE">Joson</span> <span style="">then went to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> on a special civil action
for <i>certiorari</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> together </span>with <span style="">the widow of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sinaguinan</span>, then already
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners there alleged
that respondent Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources acted without or
in </span>excess <span style="">of jurisdiction, or
with grave abuse of discretion, </span>in <span style="">entertaining
the appeal of the <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span> <span class="SpellE">Agricola</span>
</span>with respect <span style="">to lots Nos. 3804,
3805 and 3806 because they were not included in the investigation originally </span>ordered
and <span style="">conducted by the Bureau of Lands,
nor in his decision </span>rendered <span style="">as
a result of </span>that investigation; and in making his findings of fraud and
irregularities against petitioners without giving them an opportunity to be
heard and to present their evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of First
Instance denied the petition, and petitioner forthwith interposed the present
appeal from the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not see that the
lower court erred in so deciding, and finding that respondent Secretary acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction or committed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">grave abuse of discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, petitioners obtained a favorable ruling from
said respondent on their motion for reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1960</st1:date>, when the Secretary
held, in his order of <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1960</st1:date>,
that petitioners' titles to the lots in question had become indefeasible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that the same order contains
findings of fraud and irregularities in connection with the issuance of the
home­stead patents to petitioners, but said findings, according to respondent,
were based on the records <span style="">before </span>him,
and made with a view to a "thorough investigation for purposes of
ascertaining and pin-pointing the officials and employees (of the Bureau of
Lands) who are responsible for such fraud and irregularity." Those
findings were certainly within the competence and authority of respondent
Secretary to make, for the specific purpose intended, in the exercise of his
administrative power of supervision over the officials and employees under
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to their correctness, the
same cannot properly be reviewed by the courts particularly in a special civil
action for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners have raised the issue of due process, alleging that
they had not been heard before the condemnatory findings were arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This issue was correctly disposed of in the
order of <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1960</st1:date>,
wherein respondent Secretary stated:</p>

<blockquote>"In our order of <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="4">April
 11, 1960</st1:date>, we directed a formal investigation of this case so that
he (petitioner <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>) could be given all the chances
to present his side of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
he objected to that order and as we found his objection to be well taken, we
set the same aside and did away with a formal investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now he comes and <span style="">says </span>that he has not been afforded "<span style="">Due </span>Process of Law." Nevertheless, he can still have the
opportunity to take advantage of a due process of law if he appears as an
interested party at, and cooperate in, the investigation directed to be made in
the last paragraph of the aforementioned order (of August 24, 1960)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In any event, the order
complained of in the instant case has practically become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It appears from the motion to dismiss </span><span style="">filed </span><span style="">in the Court below by </span>respondent <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de <span class="SpellE">Balarin</span> on
April 30, 1964, that in July 1962, even ahead of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
the Republic of the Philippines through the Director of Lands filed complaints
for reversion against herein petitioners, precisely for the annulment of the
patents and titles issued for the lots involved in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said complaints were docketed as Case No.
3972, against Leonardo T. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>, et al., and Case No.
3976, against <span class="SpellE">Migradel</span> del Barrio <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Sinaguinan</span>, both in the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the matters objected to by
petitioners in the order <span style="">of </span>respondent
Secretary dated <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1960</st1:date>,
