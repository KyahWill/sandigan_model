				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A parcel of registered land, Lot No. 88, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
Cadastre, was under co-ownership among the four children of the deceased
Esteban <span class="SpellE">Tornilla</span>, who inherited it from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said children, named <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caridad</span>, Fernando and Eugenia, on <st1:date year="1934" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1934</st1:date> transferred the title of
the land to their names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Transfer Certificate of Title No.</span> RT-1978 (17312) was issued
in their favor as co-owners, <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span>,
in equal shares of one-fourth each.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> transferred her share to her co-owner
Eugenia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of quitclaim that <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> executed was annotated on the back of the title
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span>
and Fernando died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernando's <span class="GramE">heirs</span> who succeeded him to his one-fourth share in Lot No.
88, transferred their one-fourth share to <span class="SpellE">Domiciano's</span>
heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said lot, therefore, became owned
in common by Eugenia, with a share of one-half, and the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span>, with a share of one-half.</p>

<p class="BODY">A subdivision plan was made and approved by the Director of
Lands, proposing to divide the lots into Lots 88-A and 88-B, with sublet 88-A
allocated to Eugenia and <span class="SpellE">sublot</span> 88-B to <span class="SpellE">Domiciano's</span> heirs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, a petition was filed on October 23, 1964 with the
registration court (Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental) for partial cancellation of the present title certificate and the
issuance of a new title certificate over <span class="SpellE">sublot</span> 88-A
in the name of Eugenia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said petition,
filed by Eugenia carried the signed conformity of Fernando's heirs (who had
agreed to waive their one-fourth share in favor of <span class="SpellE">Domiciano's</span>
heirs).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was opposed, on November 6, 1964, by <span class="SpellE">Domiciano's</span> heirs, who alleged that the subdivision plan
was made without their knowledge or consent and is unfair to them because <span class="SpellE">sublot</span> 88-B includes a portion of land (320 sq. meters)
purportedly conveyed by decedent Esteban <span class="SpellE">Tornilla</span> to
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> on February 4, 1918, as allegedly
evidenced by an unregistered deed of sale which they discovered after Esteban's
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further alleged by <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> that in view of their serious objection, the
case is controversial and thus a new title certificate cannot be had thru the
summary proceedings under Section 112 of Act 496, such as the petition in
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1964</st1:date>,
the registration court issued an order requiring <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
to file the necessary com足plaint - to show that there really was a
controversial issue - within ten (10) days, or else it would proceed with the
hearing of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ten-day period lapsed without any complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> as ordered by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thereupon, on motion of petitioner,
proceeded with the reception of petitioner's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thereafter on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1964</st1:date>, it granted the petition,
approving the subdivision and ordering the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental to partially cancel Transfer Certificate
of Title No. RT-1978 (17312) covering <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 88 and to
issue a new title certificate for <span class="SpellE">sublot</span> 88-<span class="GramE">A</span> in petitioner's name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this, <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> appealed directly to
this Court, upon a point of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Does the objection raised by appellants render a petition under
Section 112 of Act 496, improper?</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 112 of Act 496 allows cancellation of certificate of
title upon petition by a registered owner (or co-owner) when, among other
specific grounds, registered interests have terminated and new ones have arisen
or upon any other reasonable ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This section may be availed of by co-owners to subdivide and partition
registered land under co-ownership<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and secure issuance of separate certi足ficates for the segregated portion.</p>

<p class="BODY">For such a petition to prosper, however, the law requires that
there must be "unanimity" among the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not, the case would be controversial and
should be li足tigated in an ordinary action where the incident at issue,
properly pertains.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
And "unanimity" among the parties has been clarified to mean lack of
serious objection on the part of a party in interest.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, appellants' claim of lack of knowledge of the subdivision
plan is not supported by any evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their unsupported claim will not prevail over the presumption of
regularity and performance of official duty (Sec. 5[1], Rule 131, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
subdivision plan having been approved by the Director of Lands, notice to all
parties concerned is presumed in the absence of contrary evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that even assuming they had knowledge of the
subdivision, the same is unfair to them because, as stated, the portion
assigned to them, <span class="SpellE">sublot</span> 88-B, includes a part
purportedly sold by the decedent to, a third person in 1918.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants' objection, based on said alleged
unregistered sale, is not serious in nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming it is <span class="GramE">true,</span> still none of the
registered co-owners, including appellants, could be adversely affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The portion purportedly sold was part of duly
registered land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale has never been
registered up to now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The supposed buyer
has raised no claim to the portion of land supposedly sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decedent's four children started claiming
the land as their own way back in 1934 when they obtained title certificate
thereto (<u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span>) in their
names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any right of the supposed buyer
would appear to have definitely prescribed or lapsed thru inaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since said alleged buyer does not appear to
be in a position to still legally bother <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>,
and have in fact not bothered the co-owners thru all these years, said interest
on the supposed buyer's part cannot provide a serious objection to resisting the
subdivision of the lot and issuance of separate title certificates over the <span class="SpellE">sublots</span>, under Section 112 of Act 496.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, moreover, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> gave appellants suf足ficient
opportunity to show that they have tendered a serious objection by allowing
them to file the necessary complaint (action for partition or to remove cloud
on title), but they failed to avail thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This renders very clear the fact that their objection is not serious,
for they themselves were not inclined to act thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order granting the petition for
partial cancellation of title certificate and issuance of new <span class="GramE">one,</span> is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellants.</span></p>
