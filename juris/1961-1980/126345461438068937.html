Instance of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, Jose Maria Ramirez, brought this action<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
against defendants Jose <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Ramirez, Rita D.
Ramirez, Belen T. Ramirez, David <span class="SpellE">Margolies</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> &amp; Sons, Inc., the Estate of the late Jose <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> Ramirez, represented by its ju­dicial administrator,
the Bank of the Philippine Islands, and Angela M. Butte – hereinafter referred
to collectively as de­fendants – for the partition of a parcel of land situated
at the Northwestern corner of <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span> street and
Plaza Sta. Cruz, Manila – otherwise known as Lot 1 of Block 2120 of the
Cadastral Survey of Manila and more particularly described in Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 53946 of the Register of Deeds for said City – and
belonging <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span> to both parties,
one sixth (1/6) to the plaintiff and five-sixths (5/6) to the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> &amp; Sons expressed its
conformity to the partition, "if the same can be done without great
prejudice to the interests of the parties." Defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Butte</st1:place></st1:city>
agreed to the partition prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other defendants objected to the physical partition of the property in
question, upon the theory that said partition is "materially and
legally" impossible and "would work great harm and prejudice to the
co-owners." By agree­ment of the parties the lower Court referred the matter
to Commission completed of:</p>

<blockquote>(1) <span class="SpellE">Dellin</span> <span class="SpellE">Gawaran</span>,
Deputy Clerk of said court, as Chairman,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> U.</st1:city> <st1:country-region>Valencia</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
President of the Manila Board of Realtors as commissioner for plaintiff, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) Ramon F. <span class="SpellE">Cuervo</span>, President of the Perpetual Investment Corporation,
Inc., as commissioner for de­fendants,</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">to</span> determine
whether the property is susceptible of partition, and submit a plan <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, if feasible, as well as to report thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the commissioners submitted
their individual reports with their respective plans for the segre­gation of
plaintiff's share.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the Court rendered a decision declaring that
plaintiff is entitled to the segregation of his share, and directing that the
property be partitioned in accordance with the plan submitted by commissioner
Valencia, and that the expenses incident thereto be paid by both parties propor­tionately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal by the
defendants, except Mrs. Butte.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants maintain that the lower court has erred: 1) in holding that
said property is legally susceptible of physical division; 2) in accepting the
recommendation of com­missioner Valencia, instead of that of commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cuervo</span>, or a proposal made by the very plaintiff; and 3) in
not order­ing that the incidental expenses be borne exclusively by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first alleged error, it is urged that a
physical division of the property will cause "inestimable damage" to
the interest of the co-owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
evidence, how­ever, has been introduced, or sought to be introduced, in sup­port
of this allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the same
is predicated upon the assumption that a real estate suitable for commer­cial
purposes – such as the one herein sought to be parti­tioned – is likely to
suffer a proportionately great diminution in value when its area becomes too
small.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, then, if plain­tiff's share
of 260.26 square meters were segregated from the property in question, there
would still remain a lot of 1,301.34 square meters for appellants herein and Mrs.
Butte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A real estate of this size, in
the very heart of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, is not,
however inconsequential, in comparison to that of the present property of the
community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, we do not
believe that its value would be impaired, on account of the segregation of
plaintiff's share, to such an extent as to warrant the conclusion that the
property is indivisible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants argue that, instead of making the aforemen­tioned
segregation, plaintiff's share should be sold to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this pretense, they cite the
provision of Article 495 of our Civil Code, to the effect that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding article, the co-owners cannot
demand a physical division of the thing owned in common, when to do so would
render it unser­viceable for the <span style="">use </span>for
which it is intended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
co-ownership may be terminated in accordance with article 498."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">They apparently assume, once again, that the alleged
"inestimable damage" to be suffered by the property, if plaintiff’s
share were segregated, is equivalent to rendering it "un­serviceable for
the use for which it is intended." independently of the fact that the
minor premise of this syllogism – the alleged "inestimable damage" –
has not been established, the conclusion drawn by appellants does not follow
necessarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the record shows
that there are two (2) buildings on land in question, namely: 1) a two-storey
commercial building – known as "Sta. Cruz Building" – abutting, on
the one (1) side,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> on the <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>,
and, on the other,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> on Plaza Santa Cruz; and 2) a
small two-storey residential building, on the Northwestern end of the lot, and
behind the first building, adjoining the <span class="SpellE">Estero</span> de la
<span class="SpellE">Reina</span>, which constitutes the South­western boundary
of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing to <span class="GramE">shown</span> that, after segregating plaintiff's share, the
buildings left on the remaining 1,301.34 square meters, representing defend<span style="">ants' </span>share, would be unserviceable,
either for commercial or for residential purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it seems ob­vious that plaintiff
would not insist upon the partition prayed for, if his share<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> <span style="">whe</span>re
unserviceable for either – particularly the commercial – purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <u>every</u> one of the
aforementioned commissioners, <u>including the one representing defendants
herein, recommended the segregation</u> of plaintiff's share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commissioners merely failed to agree on
the precise configuration thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the second issue raised by appellants: whether
the lower court should have adopted the plan submitted by their own
commissioner, or "in not taking into considera­tion," at least, a
proposal made by plaintiff herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this <span style="">con</span>nection, it appears that
said commissioner<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> recommended that<span style=""> </span>plaintiff's share be given a frontage
of 6.14 lineal meters at Plaza Sta. Cruz, whereas the commissioner for the
Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> favored a frontage of 12.66 square meters at said
Plaza; that defendants' main objection to the plan recommended by commissioner
Valencia<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> and adopted by the lower court, is that it left, <u>behind</u>
the portion awarded to plaintiff, a lot of 169 square meters, which would have
to be divided among the defendants, should they later wish to have their
individual shares segregated; and that, in order to offset this objection,
plaintiff had expressed – in one of the pre-trials held in the lower court and
in order to "facilitate early termination" of the case – the
willingness “to buy from the other co-owne<span style="">r</span>
the remaining portion of the land behind his lot at P1,000 per square meters.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not show that this offer of the plaintiff had not
been "taken into consideration" by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, defendants had <u>not</u> accepted
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <u>neither</u> do they accept it
now, for they would want the plaintiff to pay a price higher than that offered
by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the
disadvantage resulting to the defendants from the ex­istence of said lot of 169
square meters, behind that award­ed to the plaintiff, is offset by the fact
that the remaining portion of the land in question – representing defendants'
collective shares – has, <u>in addition </u>to a frontage of around 40 meters
on Plaza Santa Cruz, <u>a frontage of 24.13 meters </u><u><span style="">on </span><span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>
Street,</u> which apart from being, admittedly, the <u>most</u> valuable one,
is totally denied to the plaintiff, Then, again the <span class="SpellE">Cuervo</span>
plan giving plaintiff a 6.14 meters front­age at Plaza Sta. Cruz, goes all the
way down to the Western of the property, the <span class="SpellE">Estero</span>
de la <span class="SpellE">Reina</span>, and would re­quire a partition of the
residential building, on that part of the property in question, which the very
plaintiff says is in­divisible, because it would render said building
"unservice­able for the purpose for which it is intended."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the last alleged error, it is obvious that the
segregation of plaintiff's share inures to the benefit, not only of the plaintiff,
but, also, of the defendants, and that both should, consequently, defray the
incidental ex­penses.</p>

Deputy Clerk <span class="SpellE">Gawaran's</span> plan is more objectionable to
the defendants, not only because it gives plaintiff a bigger frontage of 12.66
meters at Plaza Santa Cruz, but, also, be­cause it leaves a bigger backyard
lot, of 225 square meters, on the side adjoining the <span class="SpellE">Estero</span>
de la <span class="SpellE">Reina</span>, without access to any street.</p>
