<blockquote>Pursuant to the agreement mentioned above, peti­tioner gave to <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> Manganese Mines, Inc. yearly advances starting from
1945, which advances amounted to P587,308.07 by the end of 1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite these ad­vances and the resumption of
operations by <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> Manganese Mines, Inc., it
continued to suffer losses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By 1951,
petitioner became convinced that those advances could no longer be
recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it con­tinued to give
advances, it decided to write off as worthless the sum of P353,134.25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amount 'was arrived at on the basis of
the total of advances made from 1945 to 1949 in the sum of P438,981.39, from
which amount the sum of P85,647.14 had to be de­ducted, the latter sum
representing its pre-war assets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 136-139, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).'
(Page 4, Memorandum for Petitioner.) Petitioner decided to maintain the advances
given in 1950 and 1951 in the hope that it might be able to recover the same,
as in fact it con­tinued to give advances up to 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From these facts, and as admitted by
petitioner itself, <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> Man­ganese Mines, Inc. was
still in operation when the advances corresponding to the years 1945 to 1949
were written off the books of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, was the sum of P353,134.25 properly claimed by
petitioner as deduction in its income tax return for 1951, either as losses or
bad debts?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It will be noted that in giving advances to <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>
Manganese Mines, Inc. petitioner did not expect to be repaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that some testimo­nial evidence
was presented to show that there was some agreement that the advances would be
repaid, but no documentary evidence was presented to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The memorandum agreement signed by the
parties appears to be very clear that the consideration for the advances made
by petitioner was 15% of the net profits of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>
Manganese Mines, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if
there were no earnings or profits, there was no obligation to repay those
advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that the

<blockquote>“Is the said amount deductible as a bad debt?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, petitioner gave advances

when petitioner wrote off the advances and deducted the amount in its return
for said year, yet the debt is not deductible in 1951 as a worthless debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the debtor was still in
operation in 1951 and 1952, as petitioner continued to give advances in those
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that if the debtor
corporation, although losing money or insolvent, was still operating at the end
of the taxable year, the debt is not considered worthless and therefore not
deductible."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Tax Courts disallowance of the write-off was proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General has rightly pointed out
that the taxpayer has taken an "ambiguous position" and "has not
definitely taken a stand on whether the amount involved is claimed as losses or
as bad debts but insists that it is either a loss or a bad debt."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
We sustain the government's position that the advances made by the taxpayer to
its 100% subsidiary, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>
Manganese Mines, Inc. amounting to P587,308.07 as of 1951 were investments and
not loans.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The evidence on record shows that the board of directors of the two companies
since August, 1945 were identical and that the only capital of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> Manganese Mines, Inc. is the amount of P100,000.00
entered in the taxpayer's balance sheet as its investment in its subsidiary
company.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This fact explains the liberality with which the taxpayer made such large ad­vances
to the subsidiary, despite the latter's admittedly poor fin­ancial condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The taxpayer's contention that its advances were loans to its
subsidiary as against the Tax Court's finding that under their memorandum
agreement, the taxpayer did not expect to be repaid, since if the subsidiary
had no earnings, there was no obligation to repay those advances, becomes
immaterial, in the light of our resolution of the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Tax Court correctly held that the
subsidiary company was still in operation in 1951 and 1952 and the taxpayer
continued to give it advances in those years, and there­fore, the alleged debt
or investment could not properly be consi­dered worthless and deductible in
1951, as claimed by the tax­payer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, neither under Section 30(d) (2) of our Tax Code providing
for deduction by corporations of losses actually sustained and charged off
during the taxable year nor under Sec­tion 30 (e) (1) thereof providing for
deduction of bad debts actual­ly ascertained to be worthless and charged off
within the taxable year, can there be a partial writing off of a loss or bad
debt, as was sought to be done here by the taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For such losses or bad debts must be
ascertained to be so and written off during the taxable year, are therefore
deductible in full or not at all, in the absence of any express provision in
the Tax Code author­izing partial deductions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Tax Court held that the taxpayer's loss of its invest­ment in
its subsidiary could not be deducted for the year 1951, as the subsidiary was
still in operation in 1951 and 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tax­payer, on the other hand, claims that its advances were irretriev­ably lost
because of the staggering losses suffered by its subsidia­ry in 1951 and that
its advances after 1949 were "only limited to the purpose of salvaging
whatever ore was already available, and for the purpose of paying the wages of
the laborers who needed help."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The correctness of the Tax Court's ruling in sustain­ing the disallowance of
the write-off in 1951 of the taxpayer's claimed losses is borne out by
subsequent events shown in Cases L-24972 and L-24978 involving the taxpayer's
1957 income tax liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Infra,
paragraph 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will there be seen that
by 1956, the obligation of the taxpayer's subsidiary to it had been reduced
from P587,398.97 in 1951 to P442,885.23 in 1956, and that it was only on
January 1, 1956 that the subsidiary decided to cease operations.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(c.) <u>Disallowance
of losses in <span class="SpellE">Balamban</span> Coal Mines<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1950 and 1951</u>) -- The Court sustains the
Tax Court's disallowance of the sums of P8,989.76 and P27,732.66 spent by the
taxpayer for the operation of its <span class="SpellE">Balamban</span> coal mines
in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in 1950 and 1951, respectively, and claimed
as losses in the taxpayer's re­turns for said years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Tax Court correctly held that the losses
"are deductible in 1952, when the mines were abandoned, and not in 1950
and 1951, when they were still in operation."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The taxpayer's claim that these expenditures should be allowed as losses for
the corresponding years that they were incurred, because it made no sales of
coal during said years, since the promised road or outlet through which the
coal could be transported from the mines to the provincial road was not
constructed, cannot be sus­tained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
definite event must fix the time when the loss is sustained, and here it was
the event of actual abandonment of the mines in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Tax Court held that the losses, <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P36,722.42 were properly deductible in 1952, but
the appealed judgment does not show that the taxpayer was credited <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the determination of its tax liability for said
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This addi­tional deduction of
P36,722.42 from the taxpayer's taxable in­come in 1952 would result in the
elimination of the deficiency tax liability for said year in the sum of
P3,600.00 as determined by the Tax Court in the appealed judgment.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Taxable increase in
net worth (1950-1951</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- The Tax
Court set aside the Commissioner's treatment as taxable income of certain
increases in the taxpayer's net worth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It found that:</p>

<blockquote>"For the year 1950, respondent determined that petitioner had
an increase in net worth in the sum of P30,050.00, and for the year 1951,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the sum of P 1,382.85.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These amounts were treated by respondent as
taxable income of petitioner for said years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that petitioner had an account with the Manila
Insurance Company, the records bearing on which were lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When its records were reconstituted the
amount of P349,800.00 was set up as its liability to the Manila Insurance
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was discovered later that
the correct liability was only P319,750.00, or a difference of P30,050.00, so
that the records were adjusted so as to show the correct liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correction or adjustment was made in
1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent contends that the
reduction of petitioner's liability to Manila Insurance Company restated in the
increase, of petitioner's, net worth to the extent of P30,050.00 which is
taxable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is erroneous. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The principle underlying the taxability of an
increase in the net worth of a tax-payer rests on the theory that such an
increase net worth, if unreported and not explained by the taxpayer, comes from
income derived from a taxable<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Perez v. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, G. R. No. L-9193, <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1957</st1:date>; Coll. vs. Reyes, G. R. Nos. L-11534 &amp;
L-11558, <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="11">Nov. 25, 1958</st1:date>.)
In this case, the increase in the net worth of petitioner for 1950 to the
extent of P30,050.00 was not the result of the receipt by it of taxable income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was merely the outcome of the correction
of an error in the entry in its books relating to its indebtedness to the
Manila Insurance Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Income Tax
Law imposes a tax on income; it does not tax any or every increase net worth
whe­ther or not derived from income.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surely, the said sum of P30,050,00 was not income to petitioner, and it
was error for respondent to assess a deficiency income tax on said amount.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same holds true in the case of the alleged increase in
net worth of petitioner for the year, 1951 in the sum of P1,382.85.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that certain items (all amounting
to P1,382.85) remained in petitioner's books as outstanding liabilities of
trade creditors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These accounts were
discovered in 1951 as in the sum of P1,382.85) remained in petitioners books as
outstanding liabilities of trade creditors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These accounts were discovered in 1951 as having been paid in prior
years, so that the necessary adjustments were made to correct the errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was an increase in net worth of the petitioner,
the increase in net worth was not the result of receipt by petitioner of
taxable income."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Commissioner advances no valid
grounds in his brief for contesting the Tax Court's findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, these increases in the taxpayer's
net worth were not taxable increases in net worth, as they were not the result
of the receipt by it of unreport­ed or unexplained taxable income, but were
shown to be merely the result of the correction of errors in its entries in its
books relating to its indebtednesses to certain creditors, which had been
erroneously overstated or listed as outstanding when they had in fact been duly
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Tax Court's action must be
affirmed.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> <u>Gain realized from
sale of real property (1950</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- We
likewise sustain as being in accordance with the evidence the Tax Court's
reversal of the Commissioner's assessment on an alleged unreported gain in the
sum of P11,147.26 in the sale of a certain real property of the taxpayer in
1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the Tax Court, the
evidence shows that this property was acquired in 1926 for P11,852.74, and was
sold in 1950 for P60,000.00, apparently, resulting in a gain of P48,147.26.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

It was sufficiently proved from the taxpayer's books that after acquir­ing the
property, the taxpayer had made improvements <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P11,147.26,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
accounting for the apparent discrepancy in the reported gain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, this figure added to the
original acquisition cost of P11,852.74 results in a total cost of P23,000.00,
and the gain derived from the sale of the property for P60,000.00 was correctly
reported by the taxpayer at P37,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second issue of prescription, the taxpayer's conten­tion
that the Commissioner's action to recover its tax liability should be deemed to
have prescribed for failure on the part of the Commissioner to file a complaint
for collection against it in an appropriate civil action, as
contradistinguished from the answer filed by the Commissioner to its petition
for review of the ques­tioned assessments in the case <u>a</u> <u>quo </u>has
long been rejected by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has consistently held that "a judicial action for the collection of
a tax is begun by the filing of a complaint with the proper court of first
instance, or <u>where the assess­ment is appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals,
by filing an answer to the taxpayer's petition for review wherein payment of
the tax is prayed for.</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
This is but logical for where the taxpayer avails of the right to appeal the
tax assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals, the said Court is vested with the
authority to pronounce judgment as to the taxpayer's liability to the exclusion
of any other court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case,
regardless of whether the assessments were made on February 24 and 27, 1956, as
claimed by the Com­missioner, or on December 27, 1955 as claimed by the
taxpayer, the government's right to collect the taxes due has clearly not
prescribed, as the taxpayer's appeal or petition for review was filed with the
Tax Court on May 4, 1960, with the Commissioner filing on May 20, 1960 his
Answer with a prayer for payment of the taxes due, long before the expiration
of the five-year period to ef­fect collection by judicial action counted from
the date of assess­ment.</p>

investment,” representing the alleged value of its contractual rights and
titles to mining claims in the sum of P242,408.10 and thus deduct outright
one-fifth (1/5) of this "capital investment" every year, regardless
of whether it had actually mined the product and sold the products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very authorities cited in its brief give
the correct concept of deple­tion charges that they "allow for the
exhaustion of the capital value of the deposits <u>by production</u>";
thus, "as the cost of the raw materials must be deducted from the gross
income before the net income can be determined, so the estimated cost of the
reserve used up is allowed."<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span> The alleged "capital
investment" method invoked by the taxpayer is not a method of deple­tion,
but the Tax Code provision, prior to its amendment by Section 1, of Republic
Act No. 2698, which took effect on June 18, 1960, expressly provided that
"when the allowances shall equal the capital invested ... no further
allowances shall be made;" in other words, the "capital
investment" was but the limitation of the amount of depletion that could be
claimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The outright deduction by the
taxpayer of 1/5 of the cost of the mines, as if it were a "straight
line" rate of depreciation, was correctly held by the Tax Court not to be
authorized by the Tax Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals,

of the losses of P36,722.42 disallowed in 1951 and 1952 to the taxpayer for the
year 1953 as directed in paragraph 1 (c) of this decision, is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the Court of
Tax Appeals appealed from in Cases Nos. L-24972 and 24978 is affirmed <u>in</u>
