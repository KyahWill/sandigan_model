				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the judgment dated <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1966</st1:date> in civil case 48964 of the
Court of First Instance of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="10">October 25,
 1960</st1:date>, the Philippine Education Co. shipped on board the "SS
PRESIDENT TAFT," in <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>,
726 packages of books, magazines; globes and other merchandise, consigned to
itself for discharge at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vessel arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1960</st1:date> and
discharged the shipment to the then <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator, the Manila Port Service, with 9 packages short-landed and 40 packages
in bad-order condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination
of the bad-order cargo revealed that only 28 packages suffered loss of 9 copies
of magazines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the total number of 717
packages received by the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator from the
carrying vessel, only 603 packages were delivered to the consignee, resulting
in short-delivery of 114 packages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>package
of "Playboy" magazines discharged under a good-order tally sheet was
found short of 47 copies upon delivery to the consignee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Claims filed by the consignee with the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator having been denied, suit for damages was filed by the Philippine
Education Co. against the Manila Port Service and the Manila Railroad Co.</p>

<p class="BODY">In lieu of trial, the parties submitted a stipulation of facts,
and on February 15, 1966 the court rendered judgment "in favor of the
plaintiff and ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay the
plaintiff the sum of P3,989.19 [representing the CIF value of the 114
short-delivered packages and the 47 copies of "Playboy" magazines]
with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the
Complaint until fully paid plus the sum of P500.00 as attorney 's fees, and to
pay the costs.”</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to this Court, the defendants-appellants pray for the
reversal of the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, contending that the lower court
(1) had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action; (2) erred in not
holding that the claim in regard to bill of lading no. 84 was time barred; (3)
erred in not limiting the liability of the appellants to the invoice value of
the claim pursuant to par. 15 of the management contract between the Bureau of
Customs and the Manila Port Service; and (4) erred in awarding attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall take up the arguments of the appellants <u>in</u> <u>seriatim</u>.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants contend
that his ordinary civil action being for the collection of a sum of money in
the amount of P4,451.90 exclusive of interests and costs, jurisdiction properly
pertains to the municipal court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree that this is an ordinary action for the collection of a
sum of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total amount of the
claim is, however, not merely P4,451.90.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A perusal of the complaint reveals that the claim of the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is for the total sum of P5,451.90, consisting of
P4,451.90 representing the principal and P1,000 representing attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the then existing law<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
courts of first instance had original jurisdiction in all cases in which the
demand, exclusive of interests, amounted to more than five thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the determination of the jurisdictional
amount, only interests and costs are excluded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The amount of attorney's fees claimed is included in the determination
of the jurisdiction of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the total amount of the claim inclusive of attorney's fees
is P5,451.90.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court of first
instance clearly had jurisdiction over the case when the complaint was filed on
<st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1961</st1:date>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the stipulation of
facts submitted by the parties, two dates appear with reference to the
provisional claim under bill of lading no. 84, namely, the original typewritten
date "<st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1961</st1:date>,"
and the <span class="SpellE">uninitialled</span> handwritten date "<st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1960</st1:date>." The
appellants assign as error the finding of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that
the provisional claim was filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="12">December
 15, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A stipulation of facts is a judicial admission of all the facts
stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When counsel for the
appellants affixed his signa­ture thereto, he admitted, in behalf of his
clients, all the facts therein stated, including all changes made thereon,
unless the admission was made through palpable mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellants knew of the
alterations made in the stipulation of facts before its submission to the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he had any objection to the
alterations, he should have insisted that only the <span class="SpellE">initialled</span>
alterations be considered, and should have objected to the submission of the
case on the basis of the stipulation of facts as altered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not done, and the appellants cannot
pose this objection for the first time on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it must be noted that in the ordinary course of
events, a <u>provisional</u> claim <u>precedes</u> the <u>formal</u>
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants admit that the <u>formal</u>
claim in respect to bill of lading no. 84 was made on <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1961</st1:date>, yet they maintain that the <u>provisional</u>
claim was filed only on <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="9">September 4,
 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect they would
have this Court believe that the reverse had happened here, which is, that the <u>formal</u>
claim was made by the consignee a little less than four months prior to the
filing of the <u>provisional</u> claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is the import of the appellants’ argument; this we cannot accept
because it is patently absurd.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, a perusal of the admitted facts reveals that the 726
packages were loaded on board the same vessel, discharged <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
on the same date, and presumably received by the consignee at almost the same
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, it would be
more in consonance with reason for the consignee to file its provisional claim
under bill of lading no. 84 on December 15, 1960, together with the other
provisional claims arising from the shipment which were all filed in the same month
of December, 1960.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>next contended by the appellants
that their liability should be limited to P2,516.69 which is the invoice value
of the claim as admitted by the parties and not P3,989.19 representing the CIF
value of the short-delivery for which they were adjudged liable to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
invoke par. 15 of the Management contract which pertinently recites:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
CONTRACTOR shall be solely responsible as an independent contractor for and
promptly pay to the steamship company, consignee, consignor, or other
interested party or parties the invoice value of each package but which in no
case shall be more than five hundred pesos (P500.00) for each package unless
the value is otherwise specified and manifested, and the corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges had been paid, including all damages that
may be suffered on account of loss, destruction or damage of any merchandise
while in the custody or under the control of the contractor x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed it may be that the consignee cannot demand the full value
of the lost cargo for failure to declare the same, and <span class="SpellE">arras­tre</span>
charges were admittedly paid not on the basis thereof but on the basis of the
weight and measurement of the shipment.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It would be unjust to require the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator
to pay the full undeclared value of the lost or damaged cargo, where, as in the
instant case, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, instead of declaring the
full value of the goods and paying the corresponding charges thereon, chose to
pay charges based on a lesser value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
preceding principles notwithstanding, the provision of par. 15 of the
management contract whereby the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator
bound itself to answer not only for the invoice value of the claim - subject to
the limitation of P500 per package - but also for "all damages that may be
suffered on account of loss, destruction or damage of any merchandise"
while in its custody and control, stands out in bold relief and its import
cannot be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a number of cases
we have interpreted this provision in the management contract as embracing not
only the actual amount of costs, insurance and freight<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
but even marginal fees<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which had been paid in connection with the shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freight and insurance charges were paid in
addition to costs of the ship­ment, and the shortages suffered by the shipment
resulted in their loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are actual
damages suffered on account of the short-delivery, and, in accordance with par.
15 of the management con­tract, the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator
must answer for them.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award of attorney's
fees in the sum of P500 is, to our mind, justified by the environmental
circumstances and under the authority of par. 11 of article 2208 of the new
Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is affirmed <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, at defendants-appellants’ cost.</p>
