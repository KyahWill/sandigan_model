defendant herein having been sentenced to the extreme penalty, to indemnify the
heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span>
in the sum of P6, 000, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>
is charged with murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
information, filed with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, it is al­leged:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 11th day of March, 1968, in the City of
Iloilo, Philippines, and within the juris­diction of this Court, <span style="">said </span>accused, armed with a knife,
taking advantage of nighttime to better realize his pur­pose, with deliberate
intent to kill and without justifiable motive, with evident premeditation,
treachery and abuse of superior strength, the deceased being an old man, did
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and criminally
stab, hit and wound <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span>
with the said knife with which the said accused was provided at the time,
hitting the latter and causing upon him stab wound on vital part of his body
which caused his death moments thereafter; that the accused in this case is, a
recidivist, having been previously convicted by final judgment of the Court of
First Instance of Iloilo in Criminal Case No. 10416 for Frustrated Homicide and
was sentenced on August 22, 1964, to one (1) year imprisonment plus the cost
and in Criminal Case No. 28522 for Malicious Mischief, committed on September
18, 1967 and was sentenced on September 18, 1967 to public censure."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the decision of said Court:</p>

<blockquote>"When this case was called for arraignment and trial this
morning, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Gonzales, appear­ing in
behalf of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Opong</span>,
the duly appointed attorney de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> for the
accused, manifested that the accused is willing to enter a plea of guilty to
the crime charged and the Presiding Judge of this Court asked the accused
whether he understands the meaning of a plea of guilty and whether he is
admitting all the material averments in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the questions of the Court, the accused
answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
was further asked whether anybody threatened, intimidated or persuaded him to
enter a plea of guilty and he answered in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was then arraigned and he pleaded
guilty freely and voluntarily to the crime charged, thus admitting all the
facts alleged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Immediately after setting
forth the foregoing proceedings, said decision adds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The information alleges two (2)
qualifying aggra­vating circumstances, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Treachery and evident premeditation and three (3) generic aggravating
circum­stances of nighttime, abuse of superior strength and re­cidivism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the provision of paragraph 4, Arti­cle
64 of the Revised Penal Code, the mitigating cir­cumstance of voluntary plea of
guilty offsets one generic aggravating circumstance, thus leaving two more gene­ric
aggravating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But only one
will be taken into account in the imposition of the proper period of the
penalty provided for by law because the generic aggravating circumstance of
nighttime is absorbed or inherent in treachery, as held by the Supreme Court in
the cases of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>, 68 Phil. 675;
People vs. Mat <span class="SpellE">silang</span>, 46 O.G. No. 4, 1557; and,
People vs. Young, 46 O.G. (Sup.) No. 11, 154.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under this state of facts, the proper penalty to be imposed upon the
accused is the maximum period of the proper penalty for murder as provided for
in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"IN VIEW OF THE
FOREGOING, the accused, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>,
is hereby found guilty beyond reason­able doubt of the crime of Murder and this
Court here­by sentences him to suffer the maximum penalty of death, to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P6, 000. 00, and to pay
the costs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is well settled that,
in all cases, especially those involving capital offenses:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
(t)he court should be sure that the de­fendant fully understands the nature of
the charges pre­ferred against him and the character of the punishment to be
imposed before sentencing him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
there is <span style="">no law requiring it, yet, in
every case under the plea of guilty, where the penalty may be death, it is
advisable for the court to call witnesses for the purpose of estab­lishing the
guilt and the degree of culpability of the defendant. </span><span style="">" </span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The importance of
adhering to this practice was stressed in subsequent cases, more particularly,
when dealing with an ignorant non-Christian</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or "an ignorant person with little or
no education,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as the defendant herein seems to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In People v. Acosta,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we declared that the question of whether or
not evidence should be taken, to determine the guilt of the accused who has
entered a plea of guilty, and the circumstances attendant upon the commission
of the crime, lies within the "sound discretion" of the court,
provided that it is "satisfied that the plea of guilty has been entered by
the accused <u>with full knowledge of the meaning and conse­quences of his act</u>."
Thus, speaking through Mr. Justice Castro, this Court had occasion to advert to
the fact that "judges are <u>duty</u> bound to be extra solicitous in
seeing to it that when an accused pleads guilty he <u>understands fully</u> the
<u>meaning</u> of his plea and <u>the im­port</u> of an inevitable conviction.
"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, we
are not satisfied that His Honor, the trial Judge, had properly discharged such
duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his de­cision, he
"asked the accused whether he understands the meaning of a plea of guilty
and whether he is admitting all the material averments in the information"
and "the accused answered in the affirmative." The foregoing
statement does not sufficiently show that the defendant was <u>well</u> aware
of the import of his plea and <u>fully</u> realized the con­sequences
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questions propounded by the
lower court in this case are a far-cry from the precautions taken by Judge <span class="SpellE">Alo</span>, which merited the commendation of this Court, in the <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> case, </span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a><span style=""> from which we quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When the case was called for trial on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1961</st1:date>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>
informed the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that he was appearing also for <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>, but only as counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this manifestation, the trial
court appointed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span> as counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for the said accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>
manifested that <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> would change his former plea
of not guilty to a plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record discloses that after the trial judge had <u>re</u>­<u>peatedly apprised <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> of the severity of the offense for which he was
indicted</u> and the <u>strong possibility that the capital penalty might be
imposed upon him</u> despite a plea of guilty, <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>
<u>persisted in his intention</u> to plead guilty with the request, however,
that the death penalty be not imposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then after hearing the arguments of Provincial Fiscal Jesus N. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span> on the
effect of articles 295 and 296 of the Revised Penal Code on the case at bar, <u>the
trial judge advised the here­in accused anew that he could be sentenced to
death not­withstanding his projected plea of guilty</u>, but the <u>latter
reiterated his desire to confess his guilt</u> on the specific <u>condition
that he be sentenced to life imprisonment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually, however, <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> <u>desisted from
pleading guilty</u> and let his previous plea stand on record <u>after further
warnings that he faced the grave danger of being sentenced to death</u> in view
of the circumstances of his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the aforesaid desistance was merely momen­tary as it did not end the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> equivocation on the matter of his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a five-minute recess re­quested by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span> in order to confer with the ac­cused, the
former informed the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that his client would <u>insist

<p class="BODY">In the Acosta case,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> the trial
court had, similarly, taken pains to assure itself "that the accused was <u>well</u>
aware of the consequences of his plea" and "the <u>full</u>
import" thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">'No comparable assurance is imparted by defendant's affirmative
answer to the questions propounded by the lower court "whether he un­derstands
the meaning of a plea of guilty and whether he is admitting all the material
averments in the information." The questions were, ap­parently, formulated
in such a technical language that a layman is likely to miss the far-reaching
implications thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is every
reason to believe that the accused, who claims to be an "ice-plant
delivery boy" is not capable of understanding the precise connotation of
the term "material averments" of the information, used by His Honor
the trial Judge, without any <u><span style="">explanation
thereof, which, seemingly, was not </span>given</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, candidly confessing that the record
hardly offers him anything to cast <span style="">light
thereon, </span>Attorney Benjamin <span style="">L. </span><span class="SpellE">Bargas</span> had this to say, in his brief, as counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span>
for the accused:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"Faced with this grave
task, <span style="">this </span>representation
interviewed the accused at <span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span> for whatever
in­formation he could gather that may shed some light on the circumstances
surrounding the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Briefly, the
accused gave the following information:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was an
ice-plant delivery boy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and the deceased
lived on the same street.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased was a
carpenter, about 55 years of age, but very husky and strong.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased was some
sort of a bully in the area and on many occasions in the past had verbally
abused him when he (deceased) was drunk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the incident in
question, he was man­handled by the deceased, while the latter's son-in-law
stabbed him on the back requiring his hospitalization.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the night in
question, he had had several drinks and was in fact drunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He chanced upon the de­ceased at the market
place who was also drinking with several other men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased again heaped abusive language
upon him; not being able to contain himself any longer for the bullying tactics
of the deceased and blinded by hatred, the accused stabbed the deceased once on
the chest causing the latter's death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused claims that
when he talked with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Opong</span>, his Court appointed
counsel, he admitted having killed the deceased but <u>he did not understand
nor<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was he made to understand the
meaning or effect of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>aggravating
circumstances alleged in the Information</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this contention, it would be well not to lose sight of the fact that <u>Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Opong</span> did not attend his arraignment </u>but a
certain Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Gonzales (Decision, p.
1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was precisely with the
realization that <u>he had killed another human being without legal
justification that he pleaded guilty</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>He vehemently denies however that he understood the meaning of
treachery, evident premedi­tation, abuse of superior strength and the other
aggra­vating circumstances alleged in the Information</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even went so far as to state that the
Court interpreter was a "<span class="SpellE">Compadre</span>" of the
deceased.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We do <u>not</u> know if the information alleged above is
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, however, most of it can
be verified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the chance that it may
be true, it would seem that the accused may only be guilty of homicide and not
of murder, and indeed had no precise understanding of the meaning and effect of
a guilty plea to the Information which alleges five (5) aggravating
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is submitted that <u>this
possibility is fraught with such grave consequences</u> that a remand of the
case to the <span style="">lower Court for the taking
of evidence appears justi­fied and necessary."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> and as an officer of the Court should be
complimented and deserve emulation - that there is no reasonable certainty
that, in pleading guilty to the charge against him, the defendant did not
intend to admit merely that he had killed the offended party, overlooking the
qualifying and aggravating circumstances alleged in the information or, at
least, without a fair notion of the implications thereof.</p>
