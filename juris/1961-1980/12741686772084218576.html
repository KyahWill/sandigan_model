				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The petition herein purports to be one for review, under Rule 45 of the
Rules of Court, of a ruling or decision of the Auditor General.
  <p>
Petitioner Felix V. Espino, was the Chief of the Chemical Fertilizer
Department, National Power Corporation, hereinafter referred to as the
NPC. In December, 1959, he applied for retirement under Republic Act
No. 1616. By resolution No. 60-3725 dated June 3, 1960, he was granted
a retirement gratuity, equivalent to P17,150.00, for his creditable
service of 20.58 years, said amount to be charged against the
Fertilizer Plant Retirement Fund of the NPC. The general voucher
covering the payment of said amount was signed by the Assistant Manager
of the NPC, and, also, by its Accounting Officer, as to availability of
funds. However, petitioner could not get the approval of the General
Manager of the NPC because its auditor, respondent Juan M. Matutina,
had refused to issue the corresponding clearance.</p>
  <p>
It appears that, sometime in 1958, petitioner had authorized the
release of 4,000 bags of fertilizer to one Lucio Villanueva, whose
check for P25,640.00 in payment of part thereof was later dishonored by
the bank for lack of funds. Hence, Villanueva was charged with <i>estafa</i>
in Criminal Case No. 52086 of the Court of First Instance of Manila on
September 20, 1960, and the NPC auditor sought the advice of respondent
Auditor General on the matter of petitioner's clearance. In a 5th
indorsement, dated September 30, 1960, said respondent held the
petitioner guilty of negligence in authorizing the aforementioned
release and ruled that action on his clearance certificate "should be
held in abeyance pending the settlement of the account of and/or
termination of the <i>estafa</i> case against Mr. Villanueva." The
review of his ruling is now sought by petitioner herein, who prays,
also, that the Auditor General and respondent Matutina, as auditor of
the NPC, "be ordered to issue the certificate of clearance of the
petitioner and approve the payment of his retirement gratuity * * *
under Republic Act No. 1616."</p>
  <p> The record shows that, as
Chief of the Chemical Fertilizer Department of the NPC, petitioner had
authority over one Leopoldo A. Barrios, the sales supervisor and chief
of the NPC Marketing Division, whose duties included the reception and
processing of applications and orders and to ascertain the credit
standing and banking facilities of buyers; that on July 28, 1958, the
Goodwill Planters Association, thru Lucio Villanueva, purchased from
the NPC 4,000 bags of ammonium sulfate fertilizer worth P29,640, for
which Villanueva paid P4,000 in cash and the balance of P25,640 in a
check issued against the Equitable Banking Corporation, that upon
verification from the banks, the NPC was verbally informed, on July 31,
1958, that said check would be dishonored for lack of sufficient
deposit; that, accordingly, petitioner notified the Compañia
Maritima—hereinafter referred to as the Maritima—carrier of
aforementioned fertilizer, to withhold delivery thereof to Villanueva;
that, thereupon, the latter made representations with the NPCtor the
release of said goods, upon the ground that he had already deposited
P26,000.00 with said bank, as evidenced by the stub of his receipt for
said alleged deposit, photostatic copy of which stub appeal's in the
record; that on August 1, 1958, petitioner consequently wrote, on
behalf of the NPC, the letter attached to his petition as Annex F,
authorizing the Maritima to release the goods to Villanueva; and that,
after the latter had taken delivery of said goods, his aforesaid check
for P25,640 was dishonored by the bank.</p>
  <p>
Petitioner maintains that, when Villanueva saw him on August 1, 1958,
he (Villanueva) was accompanied by the NPC sales supervisor, Leopoldo
A. Barrios, who brought with him said letter Annex F and asked him
(petitioner) to sign it; that he (petitioner) inquired from Barrios
whether he had checked the veracity of the alleged deposit of P26,000
by Villanueva; that Barrios answered affirmatively, and added that
Villanueva was an old customer with a long line of big transactions
with the NPC; and that, relying upon the assurance thus given by
Barrios and considering that, pursuant to "Job Description and Duty
Sheet" Annex E, he (Barrios) was subject to his (petitioner's)
supervision only in a "general" way "and seldom", he (petitioner)
signed said letter Annex F.</p>
  <p>
Barrios denied having prepared this letter or given the aforementioned
assurance, but his version is refuted by the fact that his handwritten
initials appear under petitioner's typewritten name in Annex F, which,
likewise, bears his (Barrios') initials ("LAB") and the initials
("fsv") of his (Barrios') stenographer (Felix S. Velasco) typewritten
on the Mt lower margin of said document. In any event, the management
of the NPC, after considering the pertinent facts, as get forth in a
communication of its auditor, respondent Matutina, concluded that
petitioner had acted "in good faith, although * * * it turned out later
that his judgment was erroneous", and that he "should not be answerable
civilly for the unpaid account of the Goodwill Planters Association."
Thus, the Corporation does not hold petitioner liable for said unpaid
account, and, considering its inaction for about five (5) years and
seven (7) months, does not seem to contemplate taking any action
against him in connection therewith.</p>
  <p>
In the light of these facts, were respondents justified in holding
petitioner's clearance in abeyance, "pending the settlement of the
account of and/or termination of the <i>estafa</i> case against Mr. Villanueva?"</p>
  <p>
  Section 624 of the Revised Administrative Code reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
"When any person is indebted to the Government of the Philippines (or
Government of the United States), the Auditor General may direct the
proper officer to withhold the payment of any money due him or his
estate, the same to be applied in satisfaction of such indebtedness."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It is clear from this provision that respondents may set-off an
uncontested indebtedness in favor of the Government against a settled
money claim due from it. This is so because, if the creditor of the
Government admits that he is, in turn, indebted to the latter in a
settled and definite sum, compensation takes place by operation of law,
both credits being liquidated (Articles 1278 and 1279, Civil Code of
the Philippines; Luengo <i>vs</i>.
Herrero, 17 Phil., 29). But, when the alleged credit of the Government
agency concerned is denied, not only by the creditor of the Government,
but, also, by said agency, may respondents hold conclusively otherwise?
Compañia General de Tabacos <i>vs</i>. French and Unson (39 Phil., 34) answered this question as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
"* * * We think not. Certainly it is not likely to he assumed that such
an authority, to be exercised with none of the safeguards which
surround a judicial inquiry into such matters, has been conferred.</p>
    <p>
"It is important, in construing section 624 of the Administrative Code,
to ascertain the meaning of the term 'indebted' as there used. To be
indebted is to owe a debt. The word 'debt', in legal parlance, is of
more restricted meaning than the terms 'obligation' or 'liability.' 'A
debt' says Sir John Cross, in Ex parte Thompson (Mon. &amp; B., 219),
'is a demand for a <i>sum certain</i>.' A debt is an amount actually
ascertained. That there must be an ascertained debt and not a mere
unliquidated demand or liability, 'is sustained by all the cases, legal
and equitable.' (In re Adams [N. Y.], 12 Daly, 454.) In Bacon's
Abridgement the term 'debt' is defined as limited to cases im which the
certainty of the sum is made to appear and that therefore, 'the
plaintiff is to recover the same in <i>numero</i> and not to be repaired in damages by tho jury as in those actions sounding the damage.' (Watson us. McNairy, 4 Ky. 356.)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'A debt is properly opposed to unliquidated damages * * *'. (Commercial National Bank <i>vs</i>.
Taylor, 19 N.Y. Supp., 633.) It seems to us, therefore, quite clear
that the authority conferred upon the Auditor by section 624 of the
Administrative Code of 1917 to set-off 'debts' to the Government
against 'money due' the debtor does not extend to unliquidated,
disputed claims arising from tort or breach of contract.'"</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The reason for this view was set forth in the decision of this Court in the case last cited, from which we quote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
"The principle under consideration "was the basis of the decision in
the very recent and important case of Smith vs. Jackson, decided by the
Supreme Court of the United States, April 15, 1918 (Advance Sheets,
1918, p. 478). The plaintiff in that proceedings was the judge of the
district court of the Panama Canal Zone, and was entitled, by statute,
to an annual salary of $6,000, payable at the rate of $500 a month. A
dispute arose between Judge Jackson and H. S. Smithy the auditor of the
Canal Zone, arising from the fact that the judge had occupied a house
belonging to the government for which, in the opinion of the auditor,
he should have paid rent. The Auditor was also of the opinion that the
judge had overstayed his leave of absence by several days, and that he
should be deprived of his salary for the corresponding period. The
judge denied the liability. The auditor thereupon proceeded to
liquidate the alleged claim of the government against the judge, and to
enforce his decision by offsetting the supposed debt against the
judge's salary. The judge declined to acquiesce in this ruling and
filed suit in the district court of the Canal Zone for a mandamus
against the auditor to compel him to pay the salary without any
deductions whatsoever. The Honorable Henry D. Clayton, district judge
of the middle and northern districts of Alabama, was designated by the
President to bear the case. In a carefully prepared opinion, based upon
an exhaustive citation of authorities. Judges Clayton held that the
writ should issue, and that the auditor was without authority to
set-off against the <i>liquidated debt</i> of the government to the petitioner the <i>unliquidated claim</i> which he conceived to exist in favor of the government.</p>
    <p align="center">
      * * * * * *</p>
 "* * * Upon this point Judge Clayton said:
 <p>
'Mr. Attorney-General Gregory was correct in saying that if the
authorities in the Canal Zone believe that the relator in the present
case owed any amounts of money whatsoever to the Panama Canal, it was a
'<i>question
for judicial rather than administrative determination', and that the
claim now urged by the respondent in this case 'could only be enforced
through proceedings in the courts</i>. That is a sententious and felicitous statement of this case.</p>
  <p>
'Judge Jackson has never had his day in court. He has been deprived of
his salary, or the sum of $1,131.76, without due process of law. It has
been withheld from him by the refusal of the auditor in this case to
issue his voucher upon which the salary is paid. The indebtedness is
denied by Judge Jackson, He denies it upon the grounds that there was
no law or regulation under which the indebtedness was or could have
been created. He denies that the respondent has authority to withhold
any part of his pay in the collection of an alleged but disputed
indebtedness. And yet the executive officer has sat as a court and
without evidence or hearing, except what ha considered evidence, and
except what he considered a hearing, decided a controversy that he
created by his own action. He has passed upon a disputed claim which is
a disputed claim merely because he has created the dispute in refusing
to make payment where it was his plain duty to make such payment. His
conduct, however good his intention may have been, <i>hardly falls short of being shocking to the judicial sense of justice, proper and orderly procedure</i>,
in a matter that is clearly justifiable. Perhaps it is not to be
doubted that if, after he had made a careful examination, the
Attorney-General had found Judge Jackson was indebted, owed the items
amounting to the salary which has been withheld by the Auditor, the
account would have been settled without court proceedings. <i>Or, if not so settled, then appropriate court action could have been had for its collection</i>.
In any event Judge Jackson was entitled to his day In court. But the
auditor here held that, having the money for Judge Jackson under his
control and subject to his disbursement, he had the right to determine
the claim against Judge Jackson one disputed in law and in fact, and
now insists that his summary way of determining an issue of law and an
issue of fact, and the collection by deduction from the Judge's salary
of a disputed indebtedness, cannot be reviewed or questioned by the
court. Notwithstanding that view I think the Attorney-General was right
in saying that the matter 'was one for judicial rather than
administrative determination, and that whatever demand or offset that
the Government may have '<i>could be enforced through proceedings</i> in the Courts.'</p>
  <p>
"From that decision the auditor appealed to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court adopted in its entirety (241
Fed., 747) the reasoning of the opinion of Judge Clayton and affirmed
his judgment. The respondent thereupon sued out a writ of error to the
Supreme Court in the United States, where the judgment was again
affirmed in a brief but emphatic opinion in which the Chief Justice,
speaking for the court, said that the decision of Judge Clayton made
'perfectly manifest the error of the action of the auditor', and that
the prosecution of the writ of error 'constituted a plain abuse by the
auditor of his administrative functions.'"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The foregoing does not imply necessarily that respondents may not,
under said Section 624, settle money claims which are contested and
unliquidated, if, <i>upon the admitted facts</i>, the indebtedness in favor of the Government appears to be certain and can be sustained <i>without extraneous proof</i>, or its exact amount, though not fixed, is <i>readily determinable by the ordinary process of accounting</i>. Thus in Ynchausti Steamship Co. <i>vs</i>.
Dexter and Unson (41 Phil., 289), it was held that the purchasing agent
may, under the direction of the Insular Auditor, deduct from the
freight due to said company the amount of the loss, shortage or damages
sustained in the course of the transportation of Government property.
So too, in Auditor General <i>vs</i>. Bartolome (94 Phil., 718), the
Court sustained the authority of the Auditor General, under said
Section 624, to order the withholding of one-half of the salary of a
cashier, until the full satisfaction of his liability to the
Government, for having cashed to an impostor a U.S. Treasury check for
P3,522.60 which was <i>expressly payable only</i> at the Manila branch of the National City Bank of New York.</p>
  <p>
The alleged liability of herein petitioner does not belong to the
foregoing class. As clearly pointed out, apart from contested by the
petitioner, the very management of the corporation in whose favor
respondents claim said liability to exist, does not believe in the
existence thereof. Indeed, some of the circumstances which may be
essential' to the determination of said liability are disputed, as well
as disputable. Consequently, upon the facts of record before
respondents, it is not possible to determine with reasonable certainty
whether or not petitioner was negligent in authorizing the release in
question on August 1, 1958. It is not fair, therefore, to make the
enjoyment of the retirement benefits to which petitioner is admittedly
entitled dependent upon the outcome of the <em>estafa</em>
case against Villanueva, in which petitioner is not a party and the
result of which would not necessarily establish that he is indebted to
the NPC. If respondents feel that the latter has a valid claim against
the petitioner, the first should cause the corresponding action to be
filed, with all reasonable dispatch, with the proper court, and apply
therein for the relief necessary to protect adequately the interest of
the NPC. Otherwise, the purpose for which the aforementioned retirement
benefits has been granted would be defeated.</p>
  <p> Respondents
have moved for the dismissal of the present case upon the ground: (1)
that petitioner is not a private person or entity and, accordingly, the
decision of respondent Auditor General is appealable exclusively to the
President ; and (2) that the subject matter of the petition herein is
not a money claim against the Republic of the Philippines, and, hence,
the decision of the Auditor General in connection therewith is not
appealable to the courts of justice.</p>
  <p>
The motion is without merit. Although petitioner was an employee of the
NPC, upon retirement as such he became a private individual. Otherwise,
he would not be entitled to the retirement benefits, his right to which
is conceded by respondents. For this reason we entertained the appeals
from decision of the Auditor General in, among other cases, Dimaano <i>vs</i>. Auditor General (L-15436, December 30, 1961), Madrid <i>vs</i>. Auditor General 108 Phil., 578), Lacson <i>vs</i>. Auditor General (107 Phil., 921) Valencia <i>vs</i>. Auditor General (107 Phil., 128) Recio <i>vs</i>. Auditor General (105 Phil., 508), Bautista <i>vs</i>. Auditor General (104 Phil., 428), Peralta <i>vs</i>. Auditor General (100 Phil., 105), and Espeso <i>vs</i>. Auditor General (97 Phil., 216).</p>
  <p>
    Respondents rely upon Styver <i>vs</i>.
Dizon (76 Phil., 725), in support of the second ground of their motion
to dismiss. That case involved an appeal from a decision of the Auditor
General affirming the ruling of the Auditor of the Postal Savings Bank
to the effect that the latter could not allow the <i>issuance of a duplicate deposit book</i> covering an alleged deposit of Styver in said Bank. It was held that the issue did not involve a <i>money claim</i>,
"that the Auditor General had no authority to decide or pass upon" it,
and that, accordingly, the case had been improperly brought on appeal
to this Court. Upon the other hand, it is not disputed that the case at
bar refers to a money claim. Moreover, the above mentioned cases of
Valencia and Lacson involved money claims against the Cebu Portland
Cement Co. and the Namarco, respectively, and yet the appeals from the
decisions of the Auditor General in connection with said cases were
entertained by this Court. At any rate, inasmuch as petitioner prays
that respondents be ordered to issue the certificate of clearance in
question and to approve the payment of the retirement gratuity due him
under Republic Act No. 1616, the petition herein may be regarded as one
for mandamus, not covered by Commonwealth Act No. 327.</p>
  <p>
    <b>WHEREFORE</b>,
respondents are hereby ordered to issue the clearance certificate
sought by the petitioner herein and to approve payment of his
aforementioned retirement gratuity, without special pronouncement as to
costs. It is so ordered.</p>
  <p> <i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon</i>, and <i>Makalintal, JJ</i>., concur.</p></div>
