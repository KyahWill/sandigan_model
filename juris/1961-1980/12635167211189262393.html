<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is before us owing to the death penalty meted out to Feliciano
de <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, for the crime of murder, of which he was
convicted by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
in the above-entitled case, and the appeal taken by defendant <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>, from the
decision therein, in which he was found guilty as an accomplice and sentenced
to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 12 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> to 20 years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, with the
corresponding accessory penal­ties, and, jointly and severally with De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span>
Fernandez in the sum of P6, 000, without subsidiary im­prisonment in case of
insolvency, as well as to pay the costs propor­tionately.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="6">June 9,
 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> Fernandez and his fa­mily
were asleep in their house at the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Sidem</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Gattaran</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Province</span></st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>. Between I0 and <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11 p.m.</st1:time>, he was awak­ened by the voice of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>,
calling him from the yard, followed by a similar call of Federico Belen, who
bade Fernandez to come down. As Fernandez did <span style="">so, </span>he found Belen and <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> standing near his house, together with Feliciano
de <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, Dante <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>.
Belen had a .22 rifle, whereas De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> carried a
grease gun. In addition to a small bolo tucked in his waist, <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> had, according to the prosecution, a home-made gun
(<span class="SpellE">paltik</span>), whereas <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>
held a wooden club.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sooner had
Fernandez emerged from his house than Belen bade him to raise his arms and lie
down on the ground, facing downward. Then Belen asked him where his gun was.
Fernandez replied that he had already returned it to the local Judge.
Thereupon, Belen ordered Fernandez to call the people in his house, which
Fernandez did. When his wife and children, and a couple of natives, who were
their <span class="SpellE">househelp</span>, came down, Belen, likewise, bade
them to lie down on their stomachs, beside Fernandez. Thereupon, De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> went up the
house, upon orders of Belen, to ascertain whether there were other people
therein, but they found none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> proceeded to ransack the house, seemingly in search
for a gun, with negative result. Then, he took from the house a flashlight, a
razor, a pair of scissors and the sum of P20 in cash. As De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> returned to the yard, Belen inquired
about the gun. Upon learning of their failure to find any, Belen scolded De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>. After bidding his (Belen’s) companions to watch
Fernandez and his family, Belen went up their house, to verify whether or not
there was a gun therein. Soon he emerged <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
carrying a bow and three (3) arrows. Then, picking up a piece of wood, he threw
it at Fernandez, hitting him on the head. Belen asked Fernandez, once more,
where his gun was hidden, but Fernandez reiterated his pre­vious answer.
Seemingly exasperated, Belen kicked him twice, called him a liar and shot him
with his (Belen's) .22 <span class="GramE">rifle</span>. And, making use of the
bow, Belen imbedded the three (3) arrows into the body of Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, the group, composed of
Belen, De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>, left;
but, before doing so, Belen warned the wife and children of Fernandez not to
report the matter to the PC because, otherwise, he would kill them.</p>

<p class="BODY">After leaving the scene of the occurrence, the group passed by
the house of <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>, who remained there, with instructions
not to report to the PC. Before departing, Belen got four (4) <span class="GramE">chicken</span> from <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next to drop from the group was <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>, followed by <span class="SpellE">Bril­lantes</span>,
both of whom were warned by Belen to keep their mouths shut. Thereafter, Belen
and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> went to the forest, where they spent
the night.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, Mrs. Fernandez
and her children had brought into their house the dead body of <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> Fernandez, which had the fol­lowing injuries:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the municipal health officer of <span class="SpellE">Gattaran</span>,
who examined said body, Fernandez had died owing to the injuries sustained by
him <span style="">in </span>the liver and the
thoracic organs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Early the next morning, a son of Fernandez, reported the
occurrence to the authorities. Forthwith, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Pagawisan</span>
of the PC organized a posse of members thereof and policemen, who went in
search of the culprits. It appears that Belen had been wanted for some time by
agents of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On
June 11, at about </span><st1:time minute="7" hour="19"><span class="GramE">7:07</span></st1:time><span class="GramE"> a. m., the posse caught up with him and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>
proceeding southward towards the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span class="GramE"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Alcala</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE">.</span> The <span class="SpellE">possee</span> fired at the
fugitives and succeeded in killing Belen, whose grease gun was found slung on
his shoulder. De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> managed, however, to escape,
dropping his rifle behind; but his freedom was short-lived, for two (2) days
later, or, on June 13, <span class="GramE">Sgt</span>. <span class="SpellE">Pagawisan</span>
apprehended him on board the ferry at <span class="SpellE">Camalaniugan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Brought to the PC Headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Nassiping</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gattaran</span>, De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> admitted his participation in the killing of
Fernandez and signed the affidavit, Exhibit D, before the Clerk of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>. Prior thereto, <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> had surrendered to the authorities, claiming that
he had acted at the point of the gun of Belen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was filed
with said Court, accusing <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Urian</span> De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>, of robbery in band with homicide. <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> was, subsequently; discharged from said inform­ation,
to be a state witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still later, the
case against <span class="SpellE">Urian</span> was <span class="SpellE">dimissed</span>
provisionally, on motion of the prosecution and with the con­formity of Mrs.
Fernandez. As a consequence, only <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> stood trial, after which, the lower court rendered a
decision, finding De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> guilty as principal by
cooperation, of robbery with homicide, with the aggravating circumstances of
band, <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and dwelling, and convicting <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> of said crime, as accomplice, and imposing upon
them the penalties already adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that both <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>
and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> were with Belen, as well as <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>, when
Fernandez was killed by Belen under the circumstances above mentioned. The
lower court found De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> responsible for the acts
of Belen, upon the ground that there was conspiracy between them. The question
as regards De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> is whether the existence of such
conspiracy has been duly established.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the record shows that <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>
was 17 years of age; that he lived with his sister Gloria, at the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Nagatutuan</span>; that on June 9, 1965, at about 8 p.m., Belen
and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> showed up thereat and bade <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> to come with them to <span class="SpellE">Taligan</span>;
that De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> then held a gun, which he pointed to <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> whereas Belen carried another gun with a
"long barrel"; that, upon arrival at <span class="SpellE">Taligan</span>,
Belen instructed <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> to take them to the house
of <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>; that, upon <span style="">reaching this house, Belen ordered <span class="SpellE">Urian</span> to
come down; that as <span class="SpellE">Urian</span> obeyed, Belen <span class="SpellE">inqui</span> red about his (<span class="SpellE">Urian's</span>)
firearm; that <span class="SpellE">Urian</span> said he had none, but added that <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> Fernandez had </span>a .38 <span style="">caliber revolver; that Belen then directed <span class="SpellE">Urian</span> to come with them, which <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>
did; that the four of them then went Northward, until they reached the house of
<span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>, whom Belen, likewise, bade to join the
group, which, thereupon, proceeded Eastward; that, as the house of Fernandez -
about 100 meters away from that of <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> - came
within their view, Belen told his companions to stand guard around it; that,
when </span>they <span style="">were near the house,
Belen bade <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> to call Fernandez; and that, as <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> did so, the events already narrated took place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be noted that
De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> accompanied Belen when the lat­ter went to
the house of Gloria <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>, on June </span>9,
1965, <span style="">at 8 p.m.; that the first two,
armed with guns, awakened <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>; that De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> pointed his gun at <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>,
when Belen bade the latter to come with them to <span class="SpellE">Taligan</span>;
that De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> went up the house of Fernandez to find
out whether there were other people therein, after Fernandez, his wife and
children and other members of their household had gone down to the yard and
lain down on the ground, by order of Belen; that De </span><span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>
had his gun aimed at <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> when they entered the
house; that, <span class="SpellE">alghough</span> the only instruction given by
Belen, before De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> went up the house, was for
him to ascertain whether there were other people therein, De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> ransacked the place, in search of the fire­arm Belen
was looking for, thereby indicating that De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> was
posted beforehand on Belen's objective; that De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>,
moreover, took and carried away a flashlight, a razor, a pair of scissors and
the sum of P20, before leaving the house; that it was De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>
to whom Belen entrusted the custody of Fernandez and the members of his family
lying down on the ground, as Belen personally went up the house of Fernandez;
that, subsequently to the commission of the crime charged, De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> was the only member of the group of Belen who stuck
to him, after leaving <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> in their respective places of abode;
that De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> even spent over 24 hours hiding in the
forests, together with Belen, until the agents of the law shot and killed the
latter; and that, even then, De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> kept on
eluding the authorities, until his apprehension on board a ferry boat, two (2)
days later. Thus, it is manifest that Belen and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>
had unity, not only of purpose, but, also, in the execution thereof, thereby
evincing the existence of cons­piracy between them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>, it appears that he was the last man to join the
group headed by Belen, before reaching the house of Fernandez; </span>that the
purpose of Belen and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, when they picked up <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>, was to look for <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>,
who was believed to have a firearm; that the idea of going to the house of
Fernandez did not <span class="SpellE">develope</span> until <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>
denied that he had any gun and revealed that it was Fernandez who had one; and
that <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> was not picked up by Belen and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, ac­companied by <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>, until these four (4) were on the way to
the residence of Fernandez. In other words, the record suggests that <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> did not know about the intent of Belen and De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> to get the gun they thought <span class="SpellE">Urian</span>
had, and could have had no previous know­ledge that their group, including <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>, would go to the place of <span style="">Fernandez. Upon the other hand, the very
evidence for the prosecution shows that <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> had
been ordered by Belen to join his group; that, although <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>
called Fernandez as soon as the group reached the scene of the occurrence, <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> did so by order of Belen; that <span class="SpellE">Paga­duan</span>
was the first member of the group to detach himself <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
after the commission of the crime charged; and that, before leaving <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> in his house, Belen bade him to refrain from
reporting the matter to the Philippine Constabulary. These circumstances
bolster up the theory of <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> to the effect that
he had acted under compul­sion from Belen, who was known to be a police
character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution argues that the failure of <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>
to escape when Belen went up the house, in order to find out by <span class="GramE">himself</span> whether there was any firearm therein, demonstrates
that the former was in conspiracy with the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should not overlook, however, the fact
that De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> was then in the yard, armed with a
gun, with which he could have shot <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span>, had he
tried to escape. In fact, <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan</span> surrendered to the
authorities shortly after Belen was killed. In short, <span class="SpellE">Pagaduan's</span>
complicity has not been established beyond reasonable doubt, and the case
should be dismissed, insofar as he is concerned, with the proportionate part of
the costs de officio.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the crime of robbery with homicide was com­mitted
with several aggravating circumstances which are not compen­sated by any
mitigating circumstance, the extreme penalty imposed upon Feliciano de <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> is in accordance with law, although the in­demnity
due from him should be increased to P12, 000.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Modified as above indicated, the decision of the lower court is
hereby affirmed, in all other respects, with the proportionate part of the
costs against Feliciano de <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>.</p>
