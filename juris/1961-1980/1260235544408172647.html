				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a case for injunction<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> filed 
by plaintiff-appellant Paciencia B. Salita to prevent the sale by the Sheriff of 
Manila of a house in satisfaction of a judgment for a sum of money obtained by 
defendant-appellee Eduardo Calleja in another case against one Francisco 
Domingo, admittedly the original owner of the said house. In this other case, 
Calleja, as plaintiff therein, secured first a preliminary writ of attachment 
which was levied on January 7, 1954 upon the house in question. But as the house 
was constructed on a lot purchased by Domingo's wife, Mercedes Domingo, from 
Realty Investments, Inc. (represented by C. M. Hoskins &amp; Co., Inc.) on an 
installment plan, and the price thereof had not yet been paid in full and, 
therefore, the certificate of title covering the land was still in the name of 
the vendor, the Notice of Attachment addressed to the Register of Deeds of 
Manila specifically stated that "the land on which this house stands has not yet 
been fully paid for, and as per investigation and information of the plaintiff 
(herein appellee Calleja), the house has not been registered under either Act 
496 or the Spanish Mortgage Law. It is desired therefore, that this Notice be 
registered under Act 3344." Accordingly, the attachment was entered upon the 
corresponding book, but not annotated on the certificate of title covering the 
land, which did not mention any improvement.
<p>Five months later, or on June 3, 1954, Realty Investments, Inc. conveyed the 
ownership of said lot to Mercedes Domingo, with the marital consent of her 
husband Francisco Domingo. However, since she still owed the company the sum of 
P4,566.20 the transfer was by means of an instrument of sale with mortgage on 
the lot and house and other improvements thereon, in favor of the vendor 
company. On the same date, TCT No. 25957 in the name of Realty Investments, Inc. 
was cancelled and, in lieu thereof, TCT No. 36372 was issued in the name of 
Mercedes Domingo, with the company's aforesaid mortgage duly annotated on the 
new title. Outside of what was said in the deed of mortgage, this new title (TCT 
No. 36372) likewise makes no mention whatsoever of a house or other improvement 
thereon, nor of the attachment.</p>
<p>On February 3, 1955, Mercedes Domingo, with the marital consent of her 
husband Francisco Domingo, who had knowledge of the existing attachment on the 
house in question, sold both lot and house to herein plaintiff Paciencia B. 
Salita, as evidenced by a deed of sale with assumption (by Salita) of the 
aforementioned mortgage in favor of Realty Investments, Inc. Said instrument was 
presented for registration on February 5, 1955, by virtue of which, TCT No. 
36372 in the name of Mercedes Domingo was cancelled and a new title (TCT No. 
38401) was issued in the name of plaintiff Salita, but with the annotation 
thereon of the mortgage in favor of Realty Investments, Inc. Again, no mention 
or annotation was made on said new title of the house in question, nor of the 
attachment thereon.</p>
<p>On June 23, 1955, said lot and house were mortgaged by plaintiff Salita to 
the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) as security for a loan of 
P10,000.00. Apparently, part of the proceeds of this loan was used to pay the 
P4,566.20 which Mercedes Domingo still owed Realty Investments, Inc. as price of 
the sale of the lot and which plaintiff Salita assumed to pay on February 3, 
1955, for the company's lien on her (Salita's) title was cancelled on July 2, 
1955. On December 16, 1955, plaintiff Salita obtained an addtional loan of 
P1,000.00 from the RFC upon the same property.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on February 14, 1955, Calleja obtained judgment in that other case 
against Francisco Domingo, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on April 
27, 1956. On October 13, 1956, Calleja obtained a writ of execution and required 
the Sheriff to satisfy the judgment by selling the attached house in question. 
Salita, thereupon, filed a third-party claim with the Sheriff claiming that the 
house in question was bought by her on February 3, 1955 including the lot on 
which it stands. To indemnify the Sheriff against any damage which the execution 
sale of the house may cause, Calleja filed a bond of P15,000.00.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the execution sale of said house and lot which was 
scheduled for December 27, 1956 at 10:00 A. M., plaintiff Salita filed the 
instant case (Civil Case No. 31434) for Injunction and Damages against 
defendants Calleja and Sheriff of Manila. On December 26, 1956, the court issued 
a writ of preliminary injunction restraining defendant Sheriff of Manila from 
proceeding with the execution sale.</p>
<p>It is the contention of plaintiff Salita that when she purchased the house 
and the lot on February 3, 1955, the vendor Mercedes Domingo had a clean title 
(TCT No. 36372) except for the mortgage over the said property (both land and 
house) in favor of Realty Investments, Inc. which the purchaser expressly 
recognized and assumed, and that upon payment of the mortgage indebtedness, she 
(Salita) became the absolute owner of the entire property, free of all liens and 
incumbrances.</p>
<p>On the other hand, defendant Calleja claims that since the certificate of 
title covering the land did not mention any improvement and since the house is 
real estate in nature and is not registered under Act 496 or the Spanish 
Mortgage Law, the registration of his attachment on January 7, 1954 under Act 
No. 3344 is effective and binding upon all subsequent claimants of said 
house.</p>
<p>The trial court upheld defendant Callejas's contention, dismissed plaintiff 
Salita's complaint and sentenced the latter to pay defendant P500.00 as 
attorney's fees on the latter's counterclaim. Hence, this appeal by Salita.</p>
<p>We find the appeal meritorious. Act No. 3344 (Sec. 194, Rev. Adm. Code) 
pursuant to which defendant Calleja's notice of attachment was registered 
expressly requires that the register book shall contain, among other things, 
"the character of the contract and its conditions, the nature of each piece of 
<em>land</em> (unregistered) <em>and its own improvements only, and not any 
other kind of real estate or properties</em>, its situation, boundaries, area in 
square meters, whether or not the boundaries of the property are visible on the 
land by means of monuments or otherwise, and in the affirmative case, in what 
they consist; the permanent improvements existing in the property * * *." From 
this provision, it seems clear that in order to be registerable under Act No. 
3344, the instrument must refer only to <em>unregistered land and its own 
improvements only</em>, and not any other kind of real estate or properties. The 
words "<em>own</em>" and "<em>only</em>" used in the language of the law when 
referring to improvements, clearly mean improvements on unregistered lands 
alone. In fine, the deed cannot refer to improvements or buildings on lands 
registered under the Torrens system, or under the Spanish Mortgage Law. To hold 
otherwise, would result in the anomalous situation of two registrations, one 
under Act 496 with respect to unimproved land, and another, under Act 3344 for 
improvements subsequently introduced on the same land. Since, in the case at 
bar, the attachment refers to a house erected on registered land, it is evident 
that the registration thereof under Act 3344 was invalid and of no legal or 
binding effect on third persons, or more particularly, on plaintiff Salita.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not disputed that in the notice of attachment of real 
estate (Exh. 6-Calleja) dated January 7, 1954, it was therein stated that the 
house in question was "erected upon land bought from C. M. Hoskins &amp; Co., 
Inc. on the installment plan," and that said house "has not been registered 
under either Act 496 or the Spanish Mortgage Law." Knowing that the land on 
which the house was built was bought from C. M. Hoskins &amp; Co., Inc., 
defendant Calleja should have investigated whether the land was duly titled and, 
finding that the same was titled, as in fact it was in the name of Realty 
Investments, Inc. (TCT No. 25957), he should have taken steps to perfect his 
lien on said house, by filing a petition for annotation of said improvement as 
well as the registration of his lien thereon, on the title of the land, pursuant 
to Section 112 of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act) which, insofar as 
pertinent, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 112. * * * <em>Any registered owner or other person in interest may at 
any time apply by petition to the court, upon the ground</em> that registered 
interests of any description, whether vested, contingent, expectant, or 
inchoate, have terminated and ceased; or <em>that new interests have arisen or 
been created which do not appear upon the certificate</em>; or that any error, 
omission, or mistake was made in entering a certificate or any memorandum 
thereon, or any duplicate certificate; * * *." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Having failed to perfect his lien on the house in question in the manner 
indicated, he cannot enforce it against plaintiff Salita, purchaser in good 
faith of the house and the lot on which it stands. The fact that the clean title 
acquired by Salita did not mention the improvement, does not preclude the 
acquisition thereof with the land described in the title. This is so, because 
unless it otherwise appears on the title itself, the same includes not only the 
land described therein, but also all improvements existing on said land. (Art. 
2127, Civil Code; Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co. <em>vs</em>. Camps, 
36 Phil., 85; Bischoff <em>vs</em>. Pomer, et al., 12 Phil., 690; Cu Unjieng e 
Hijos <em>vs</em>. Mabalacat Sugar Co., 58 Phil., 439; see also Roxas 
<em>vs</em>. Enriquez, 29 Phil., 31; Art. 440, Civil Code.)</p>
<p>Lastly, it appears that the sale made by Mercedes Domingo with the consent of 
her husband Francisco Domingo to plaintiff Salita on February 3, 1955, included 
both the house and lot in question. Likewise, the mortgage in favor of Realty 
Investments, Inc. duly annotated on Domingo's certificate of title and which 
plaintiff Salita had assumed and later paid, included both house and lot. In 
other words, plaintiff-appellant Salita actually parted with her money to 
acquire the house in question, while defendant-appellee Calleja merely seeks 
security for an otherwise unsecured pre-existing claim.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and set 
aside, without prejudice to any action which defendant-appellee Calleja may take 
to enforce his judgment against Francisco Domingo. The injunction previously 
issued by the trial court which was dissolved after judgment for defendant 
Calleja was entered below, is revived and made permanent. Without pronouncement 
as to costs. So ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion,
