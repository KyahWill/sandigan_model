				<BR><BR><div align=""><o:smarttagtype name="date" namespaceuri="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"></o:smarttagtype><div class="Section1"><p>Petition for certiorari with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction filed by <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alinsolorin</span> against Andrea <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> 
and the Hon. Mateo M. <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>, presiding judge of the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, 14th Judicial 
District, to annul the latter's order of January 12, 1960 in Civil Case No. 
<span class="GramE">R-5682, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p>On <st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1958">August 11, 1958</st1:date>, 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> commenced Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-5682 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> against her husband, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alinsolorin</span>, for separation of conjugal properties and for 
the return of her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> properties.</span> <span class="SpellE">Alinsolorin</span> denied the material averments of the complaint 
and further alleged that, inasmuch as the parties were very old and unable to 
personally administer their properties, he, as administrator of the conjugal 
partnership, had named their grandson, Julian <span class="SpellE">Suaring</span>, 
to administer their lands and collect the fruits thereof, with the obligation of 
turning over the same to them; that his wife had been receiving her share of the 
fruits.</p>
<p>After due trial, the respondent judge rendered judgment as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">"<b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, 
judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>1. Declaring the first three parcels 
described in par. 2 of the petition as the <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> 
properties of the petitioner with right to the immediate possession of the same, 
and ordering the defendant or his attorney-in-fact to deliver the same 
immediately to her;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><br><br>2. Declaring the remaining 
five parcels described in par. 3 of the petition as the conjugal properties of 
the spouses, and maintaining the husband as the administrator thereof;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><br><br>3. Ordering the said 
defendant to pay to the petitioner twenty pesos monthly as her liquidated share 
of the produce of the conjugal properties, and exempting her from rendering any 
report on the income of her <span class="SpellE">parapnernal</span> 
properties.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>No costs and damages."</p></blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, upon discovering that petitioner had sold the conjugal 
properties to their grandson, Julian Snaring, for P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> filed an 
action against them for the annulment of the sale.</p>
<p><span class="GramE">Meanwhile, as petitioner failed to pay the monthly 
allowance of P20.00 as required in the judgment rendered in Civil Case 
No.</span> R-5682—which had become final—<span class="SpellE">Salud</span> filed a 
motion therein to declare petitioner in contempt of court. During the hearing 
thereon, petitioner explained lo the court that his failure to pay the allowance 
was due to the fact that he had already sold the conjugal properties to Julian 
<span class="SpellE">Suaring</span> and that the proceeds of the sale were used to 
defray the family expenses.</p>
<p>Resolving the motion for contempt, the respondent judge, on <st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1960">January 12, 1960</st1:date>, issued the following 
order subject of the present petition.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"The court hereby resolves:</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">1. In the <u>interim</u> the civil 
case involving the validity or nullity of the supposed sale of the conjugal 
properties in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Suaring</span> is pending, to 
order the defendant to deposit the proceeds of the said sale in the Court within 
ten (10) days from receipt hereof; and to pay wit of the said deposit the 
monthly pension of the plaintiff herein."</p>
<p>The only issue now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is whether or not 
respondent judge had jurisdiction to issue the order of <st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1960">January 12, 1960</st1:date>.</p>
<p>Petitioner argues that the respondent judges order requiring him to deposit 
in court the proceeds of the alleged sale in favor of Snaring and to pay 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> the monthly pension of P20.00 from 
the proceeds aforesaid is a modification or alteration of the judgment of July 
8, 1959 which had become final; that it is also a limitation or diminution of 
his powers of administration over the properties without authority or 
jurisdiction; and that in issuing the order complained of, the respondent judge 
gave respondent <span class="SpellE">Salud</span> a relief not sought for in her 
motion for contempt of court.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>All the above contentions are without merit.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="GramE">As petitioner himself admits, the decision rendered in 
Civil Case No.</span> R-5682 has long ago become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. <span class="SpellE">Thereunder</span>, it was his 
obligation, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, to pay the monthly sum of 
P20.00 to his wife "as her liquidated share of the produce of the conjugal 
properties". Neither can petition en deny the right, nay, the duty of the 
respondent judge to see to it that the aforesaid judgment of the court is 
faithfully carried out. By selling the conjugal properties to his grandson, 
petitioner obviously intended to avoid complying with his duty under said 
judgment It was clearly, therefore, within the authority of the respondent judge 
first, to order petitioner to deposit in court what the latter claims to have 
been the proceeds of the alleged sale and to require him to use them in paying 
the amount due to his wife. Thai this relief was granted by the respondent judge 
in resolving a motion for contempt filed by petitioner's wife is of no moment, 
it being clear that such relief is another means of compelling petitioner to 
comply with the final judgment referred to heretofore.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition under consideration is dismissed, with the 
result that the writ prayed for is denied.</p>
