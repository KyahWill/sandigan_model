				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An original action of certiorari in <u><span style="">forma</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span> </span>against the municipal court's
judgment of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> against petitioner and
the court of first instance's order for execution of said judgment pending
appeal for non-filing of <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 26, 1966, respondent <span class="SpellE">Caponong</span>
filed Civil Case No. 415 in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Kabankalan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental presided by respondent judge <span class="SpellE">Gasataya</span> for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of petitioner
and his wife from the five hectare-<span class="SpellE">riceland</span> owned by
res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Caponong</span>, on the ground that the written
five-year lease contract executed between them had already expired in February,
1966 and petitioner's right to the possession and cultivation of the same had
ceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for the dismissal of respondent <span class="SpellE">Caponong's</span> complaint on the ground of the municipal court's
lack of jurisdiction, alleging that there existed a leasehold tenancy between
them entitling him to security of tenure under the Agricultural Tenancy Act
(Republic Act No. 1199) and that the action for <span style="">his <span class="SpellE">dispossesion</span> properly falls within the
original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner cited the fact of inclusion of his
wife in the action as indicating an implied admission in the complaint of <span style="">her being a member </span>of petitioner's
immediate farm household aiding in the cultivation of the <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, respondent municipal court
denied petitioner's dismissal motion and ordered, at respondent's instance, the
dropping from the complaint of petitioner's wife as a party defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner thereafter filed on June 16, 1966 his answer to the
complaint admitting the material allegations as to the execution of the lease
contract, but invoking anew the respondent court's lack of jurisdiction and
reasserting that his refusal to vacate the <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>
was by virtue of his acquired right to security of tenure under the
Agricultural Tenancy Act, since he was the actual culti­vator of the land
devoted to the production of rice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial was thereafter held by respondent municipal court, with the
parties agreeing that the only question to be resolved by the court was whether
<span style="">the court was whether the contract of
lease between them is a civil or tenancy lease, and with respondent, through
counsel, -- according to petitioner's <span class="SpellE">undenied</span>
allegation in paragraph 9 of the petition -- expressly foregoing in open court
his claim in the complaint for attorney's fees and damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1966</st1:date>,
respondent municipal court rendered its judgment ordering petitioner to return
possession of the five-hectare landholding to respondent and to pay to
respondent "the reasonable rental (in) the amount of three hundred fifty
pesos (P350.00) corresponding to and from the month of March, 1966 to July,
1966."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved respondent court for reconsideration of its
judgment on the ground that respondent had not sought in its complaint the
payment of "reasonable rental on the premises" which, any way was
duly stipulated for in their written lease contract, and that respondent had
not presented any evidence in sup­port of the rental awarded; and that the only
amount mentioned in the complaint was that of <span style="">P</span>350.00 as attorney's fee, which had been expressly waived by
respondent's counsel who had stated that respondent was only interested in the
return of the land and nothing more.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court nevertheless denied on <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1966</st1:date> petitioner's motion for
reconsideration and petitioner perfected his appeal, docketed as Civil Case No.
333 of the court of first instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental presided by respondent judge <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="9">September
 23, 1966</st1:date>, respondent filed before said lower court a motion for
execution of the municipal court's judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
on the ground of petitioner's failure to file the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond required in <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases by Rule 70, section 8
of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
opposed the same on the ground of the municipal court's lack of jurisdiction
over the subject matter as well as lack of basis to order the payment of
P350.00 as reasonable rental and further offered to file a
P1,000.00-supersedeas bond to stay execution of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court upon ascertaining that no <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond was filed beforehand, granted the motion
and ordered execution to issue immediately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration hav­ing been denied, he
thereupon instituted the <span style="">present </span>action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon petitioner's filing of a nominal bond, we issued on November
3, 1966, a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the issuance of an order
of execution of judgment by the lower court, subsequently amended on December
13, 1966 at petitioner's urgent plea to restrain respondents as well as the
chief of police of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Kabankalan</span>
from executing the judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and from
harvesting petitioner's 1966-1967 rice crop.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial jurisdictional issue at bar depends on whether the
lease contract between the parties is an ordinary civil lease or an
agricultural leasehold tenancy agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">For if it is an ordinary civil lease contract, then the
respondent municipal court properly had jurisdiction over the complaint of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> filed by respondent and to issue its judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, execution of which pending appeal for non-filing
of <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond could rightly be ordered by the
court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, if it is an agricultural leasehold tenancy agreement, then original and
exclusive jurisdiction over the case lies with the Court of Agrarian Relations
and the disposition of the case would be governed by the security of tenure
provisions of the Agricultural Tenancy Act protecting as an important public
policy the leasehold tenant from dispossession notwithstanding any agreement as
to period of <span style="">surrender </span>of the
land and except for any of the lawful cases provided by law and by final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment of the agrarian court after due hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated above, the municipal court tried the case and received
the parties' evidence on this single agreed issue of whether the contract of
lease between them is a civil or tenancy <span style="">lease, assumed </span>jurisdiction over the <span style="">case as an ordinary <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case and rendered
judgment </span>of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the crucial <span style="">issue </span>of
jurisdiction was raised anew before the court of first instance in connection
with respondent's motion for execution of the judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
pending appeal, the lower court apparently relied on the fact pleaded in
respondent judge <span class="SpellE">Abiera's</span> answer that a case to
enjoin the municipal court proceedings filed by petitioner with the Court of
Agrarian Rela­tions in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City had been
dismissed by the latter court in an order dated July 8, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was lost sight of by the lower court was
that the agrarian court's dismissal of the action before <span style="">it did not resolve the jurisdictional issue,
but was decreed conform­ably with the ruling laid down in <u>Evangelista vs.
Court of Agrarian Relations</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that when as in this case, the jurisdiction
of a court depends upon the determination of a question of fact, it must be
raised and determined in the court whose jurisdiction is questioned, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e. the municipal court where the <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case was first filed and on appeal, the court of first instance, so as to avoid
the confusion of two courts conducting simultaneous proceedings on the same
cause but based on diametrically opposed premises determinative of their
respective jurisdiction, which would not be conducive to the proper and orderly
administration of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find, however, a vital distinction between <u>Evangelista</u>
and the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, upon the
alleged leasehold tenant's motion to dismiss the complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> in the municipal court on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction having been denied, he filed a petition with the court of first
instance to prohibit the inferior court from continuing the same, which was
dismissed after hearing for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not appeal from the dismissal, but instead filed a new action
before the agrarian court for alleged "illegal dispossession and
reinstatement," having been in the meantime judicially ousted by writ of
execution issued by the municipal court for non-filing of <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond, although he thereafter appealed the judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
to the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lessee there was obviously trying to "ride two horses", and this
Court issued a writ of prohibition at the landowner's instance against further
proceedings in the agrarian court case, holding that the question of
jurisdiction of the municipal court in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case -- dependent upon the factual question of the existence of a tenancy
relationship between the parties -- being already on appeal in the court of
first instance (and the lessee having already lost his special recourse to a
writ of prohibition), the parties should await the decision of that court and
abide by it subject to appeal by any of them, and rejecting the lessee's contention
that the appealed <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case and the agra<span style="">rian court case may proceed to their
conclusion simultaneously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Here in the case at bar, the jurisdictional issue was properly
raised by petitioner before respondent court of first instance when respondent sought
the execution of the judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> pending
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent court summarily
ordered the issuance of execution on the ground of non-filing of <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond and the petition for certiorari
challenging the order for exe­cution for lack of jurisdiction is properly
before the Court and has not yet been lost as in <u>Evangelista</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court holds that such summary granting of
execution was not in accord with due <span style="">process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We hold that when the factual question
of the existence of a leasehold tenancy relation between the parties is raised,
in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, which if true, would vest
original and exclusive jurisdiction over the case in the court of agrarian
relations and not in the municipal court, it is essential that the court of
first instance hold a preliminary hearing and receive the evidence solely on
the facts that would show or disprove the existence of the alleged leasehold
tenancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of such evidence,
the court would then determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and
summarize the facts in an order upholding its jurisdiction and that of the municipal
court or declaring the lack thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such preliminary hearing is necessary after receipt by the court
of first instance of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case on appeal
from the municipal court for trial <u>de novo</u>, since the municipal court is
not a court of record and cannot elevate the oral evidence submitted to
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be preferable, of course,
should the municipal court take pains to make of record in its judgment the
pertinent facts on the basis of which it has assumed jurisdiction, for then the
preliminary hearing on jurisdiction conducted by the court of first instance
could be based thereon and considerably expedited.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, should the court wrongly assume jurisdiction, notwithstanding
that the facts at the preliminary hearing clearly show its lack of
jurisdiction, the appellate courts would have the facts before them and upon
proper recourse by the leasehold tenant, would be in a position to issue the
necessary writs of certiorari or prohibition -- unlike in the case at bar,
where the essential facts are not before us, not having been made of record
below, save for the conflicting contentions of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Leasehold tenancy is after all specifically defined by the law<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and may be expeditiously determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
enunciated by Mr. Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, speaking for the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Teodoro</span></u></span><u><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span></span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the principal <span style="">elements </span>of a leasehold tenancy contract or relation are as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The object of the
contract or the relationship is <u>an agricultural land</u> which is leased or
rented for the purpose of <u>agricultural production</u>;<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The size of the
landholding must be such that it is <u>susceptible of </u><u><span style="">personal
cultivation by a single person</span></u><span style=""> </span>with assistance <span style="">from the </span>members of his immediate farm household;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>tenant-lessee must
actually and personally till, cultivate or operate</u> said land, solely or
with the aid of labor from his immediate farm <span style="">household; and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The landlord-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, who is either the lawful owner or the legal
possessor of the land, <u>leases</u> the same to the tenant-lessee for a price
certain or ascertainable either in an amount of money or <u>produce</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We therefore hold that respondent court of first instance acted with
grave abuse of discretion in not holding a preliminary hearing on the
prejudicial factual question <span style="">of whether
or not a leasehold tenancy rather </span>than an ordinary civil <span style="">lease contract or relation </span>existed
between the parties for the purpose of determin­ing its jurisdiction to act in
the premises and instead summarily presuming its jurisdiction and issuing the
questioned order and writ for execution of the judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>should be noted
that if the facts should be as asserted by petitioner in the petition and in
his <span style="">memorandum, </span><span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>, that <span style="">he
personally </span>cultivated the five-hectare parcel <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> with </span>the aid of his wife and
three sons and that he timely paid the fixed <span style="">annual </span>rental thereof of P500.00 (the last two years in cash of <span style="">P700.00 and 20 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span>
of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>), the above elements </span>of a leasehold
tenancy relation would be shown to exist in the case and respondents courts
would have to disclaim jurisdiction over the cases below.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A contempt incident arose in this case when petitioner charged that
respondent through a trusted man, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Jaime,
intercepted on <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1967</st1:date>
petitioner's threshed <span class="SpellE">palay</span> of 31 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span>
and 20 <span class="SpellE">gantas</span>, with a value of P477.00, in violation
of this Court's preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner further prayed that respondent be made accountable for the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and that the value thereof be considered as part
payment for 1966-1967 crop year rental and credited to the P700.00-rental for
said crop year that he had earlier tendered to respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, upon the Court's show-cause
order, denied under oath petitioner's charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner later manifested on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1967</st1:date> that his criminal complaint against <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Jaime "was amicably settled when (he) agreed to accept the return of the (<span class="SpellE">palay</span>) if still in good condition" but reiterated his
prayer to be credited with the value thereof as against his rental since the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> had rotted in the possession of Jaime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court set the contempt incident for
hearing on <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1967</st1:date>
and in its resolu<span style="">tion of said date commissioned respondent judge <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span>
to receive the evidence of the parties and to submit his report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span>
carried out his commission and submitted his report of September 18, 1967,
finding no evidence of respondent <span class="SpellE">Caponong</span> having had
any part in the interception of petitioner's <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
alleged to have been committed by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Jaime and
a companion and that petitioner had admittedly merely presumed that Jaime had
been ordered by respondent; and recommending that the contempt charge against
respondent be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the
recommen­dation in order and therefore dismiss the contempt charge, without
prejudice to the accounting for the intercepted <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
asked by petitioner being threshed out in the proper proceedings, should it be
shown there that Jaime had acted on behalf of respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the writ of certiorari prayed for is
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court of first
instance's order for the issuance of execution and the writ of execution issued
pursuant thereto on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1966</st1:date>
are hereby annulled and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
court is directed to hold a preliminary hearing on the factual question of the
