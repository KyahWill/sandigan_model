<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Rejected by the trial court and thwarted by the Court of Appeal
on certiorari and mandamus, petitioner comes to this Court on appeal, by way of
certiorari, praying that the ruling of the lower courts be reversed and that
she be allowed to intervene in Civil Case 2419-P of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, entitled "Simeon del Rosario,
Plaintiff, vs. The Equitable Insurance &amp; Casualty Co., Inc.,
Defendant".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner explains
that this appeal is limited to "that portion of the decision [of the Court
of Appeals] dismissing the petition in the court below on the sole ground that
the intervention, if allowed, would ‘unduly delay and prejudice the rights of
the original parties to the case’”.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual backdrop is this:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1957</st1:date>,
the Equitable Insurance &amp; Casualty Co., Inc. - hereinafter referred to
simply as <u>Equitable</u> - issued two policies:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first, Personal Accident Policy No. 7136
on the life of Francisco del Rosario, also known as <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>
Bolero; the other, Master accident Policy No. 7137, covering those of 24
members of the vaudeville troupe of Francisco del Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beneficiary under the first policy was <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, one of those who
perished in the accident hereinafter to be mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beneficiary under the companion policy is
Francisco del Rosario, the proceeds of which are payable to him "if surviving
the Insured, otherwise to the estate of the Insured".</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 24, 1957, Francisco del Rosario, together with the
members of his vaudeville troupe, were forced to jump off the motor launch
“L-lamia” due to a fire that broke out in said vessel while in the waters of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco del
Rosario and 21 of his group died of drowning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Simeon del Rosario (father and heir of Francisco del Rosario)
claimed the proceeds of the two policies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A divergence of views arose as to the amount payable for the death of
Francisco del Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this,
agreement between Simeon del Rosario and Equitable allegedly was entered into <span class="SpellE">whereunder</span> the former would file against the latter a test
case on Personal Accident Policy No. 7136; and that in reference to Master
Policy No. 7137, the parties were to be governed by the result of that judicial
test.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it is that Simeon del Rosario sued Equitable on Policy No.
7136 before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in
Civil Case No. 1807-P of said court, entitled "Simeon del Rosario,
Plaintiff, vs. The Equitable Insurance &amp; Casualty Co., Inc.,
Defendant".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1958</st1:date>, the trial court's judgment
declared that the insurer's liability to Simeon del Rosario was P3,000 on
Policy No. 7136 aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1963</st1:date>, on appeal from said
court, this Court affirmed.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Refusal of Equitable to honor the alleged covenant brought about
the second case, Civil Case <u>2419-P</u> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, instituted on September 6, 1963 by Simeon del
Rosario against Equitable for the collection of the proceeds of Master Accident
Policy No. 7137.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 7, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Perla</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Pacursa</span>, "in her behalf and for others similarly
situated”, moved to intervene in Case 2419-P, alleging that she is the sole
heir of her husband Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Pacursa</span> and her son
Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Pacursa</span>, both members of Francisco del
Rosario' vaudeville troupe; and that "the other <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>'
(without naming them) are heirs of other members of the troupe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All those <span class="SpellE">vaudevilli</span>
who perished in the accident of <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="2">February
 24, 1957</st1:date> aforesaid - it is claimed - were covered by Master
Accident Policy No. 7137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion to
intervene - to which the complaint in intervention was attached - was set for
hearing by <span class="SpellE">Pacursa's</span> counsel himself on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1965</st1:date>, finally submitted
for resolution on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, defendant Equitable completed the presentation of its
evidence on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial of the case ended on that day, i.e.,
one day after the motion to intervene was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1965, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issued an order in said Case 2419-P, which
reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Considering the 'Motion For
Intervention' filed on December 7, 1965 by counsel for the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Perla</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacursa</span>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, on <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="3">March
 17, 1966</st1:date>, ordered the issuance of a temporary restraining order

<p class="BODY">Came the judgment of the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1966</st1:date>. <span class="SpellE">Pacursa's</span>
petition for certiorari and mandamus just mentioned was overthrown, and the
writ of preliminary injunction (should be temporary restraining order)
dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reconsideration was refused

appeal</u> from the judgment on the merits rendered in said Case 2419-P of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, for failure of the
record on appeal to show on its face that the appeal was perfected within the
permissible period fixed by the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A

Petitioner - Equitable - in that case (L-28714) prays that the resolutions of
respondent Court of Appeals of November 11, 1967 and January 17, 1968 be set
aside, and that said court be directed to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Equitable's</span>
appeal (in Case 2419-P of the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> court). </p>

petition for review on certiorari was denied due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A move to reconsider is under consideration
by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Back to the <u>present</u> <u>case</u> (L-26353) - <span class="SpellE">Perla</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacursa's</span> (in her behalf
arid for others similarly situated) - for intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> abuse its discretion in refusing intervention in Case
2419-P?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the Court of Appeals err in
sustaining the trial court?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For three
reasons, the answer to both questions must be in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>, petitioner is guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; <u>second</u> intervention will cause undue delay
and will prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties; and <u>third</u>,
the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> court is now powerless to grant
intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling provisions of the Rules of Court are:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Intervention</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A person may, before or during a trial, be

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A party in interest who
desires to pursue judicial relief - in intervention - must do so within a
reasonable time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not idly sit
by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be diligent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not permit precious time to pass
before he asserts his rights in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He should not allow a litigation in which he has a vital interest to
proceed and then make an eleventh-hour effort to squeeze himself in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are guiding principles the purpose of
which is to save parties already in court from undue delay and prejudice in the
adjudication of their right arising out of intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here is the position of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pacursa</span>
<span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the original parties in Case 2419-P of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accident occurred on <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the terms of Master Accident Policy No.
7137, no action shall be brought <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> (Clause
15, par. VII of the Policy) unless filed within two years from the expiration
of the time within which to give notice of the accident to the insurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That notice under Clause 9 should normally be
given within twenty days from the time of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These covenants in the policy should have
spurred petitioner and others similarly situated to take court action within
the limited period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, here,
petitioner (and those she purportedly represents) did not seek intervention
until <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not bestir themselves for over eight
years from the date of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They sought to intervene only after six years from the lapse of the
stipulated period within which to file an action, and over two years after
respondent del Rosario started suit against the insurance company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In plain language, they wanted to ride on the
coat tails of del Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But del
Rosario's case against Equitable is upon a <u>different</u> <u>cause</u> <u>of</u>
<u>action</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is predicated on an
agreement with the insurer - without reference to the period of filing suit set
forth in the insurance policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
quite plain that what petitioner "and others similarly situated"
would want to do is to get hold of the entire proceeds of Master Accident
Policy No. 7137 at the expense of del Rosario, and case out del Rosario from
any judgment the latter might obtain in Case 2410-P.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They will profit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simeon del Rosario will be left out in the
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is certainly not fair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason alone, we hold that their
delay is inexcusable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could work
injustice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laches</span>
should be a bar.</p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style=""> </span> On the merits of her motion for intervention, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pacursa</span> says that she would be able to get through with her
evidence in two or three sittings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
this, she infers that no substantial pre­judice to the parties already in the
case would ensue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between what a party
says and the realities of court proceedings, there is a quite a distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's intervention is not merely for
herself; it is for 19 others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
terms of the policy, for petitioner's case and those of others similarly
situated to prosper, they must prove that Francisco del Rosario predeceased
each and everyone of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a
huge task; it is time consuming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner should not expect that respondent Simeon del Rosario will
take any evidence to that effect hands down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Substantial time has passed since the date of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the difficult task to be undertaken
by respondent Simeon del Rosario - search for and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">marshall</span></st1:place></st1:city> his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How about the tremendous expenses?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place of accident is <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court sits in <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">And then, time has a way of inducing treachery of memory; it
works to obliterate important evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surely enough, it is clearly past the time when intervention should be
allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original parties and the
court will be enmeshed in divers claims which will no doubt retard disposition
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, to petitioner, a
pointless and frustrating result is not improbable at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, not even an allegation was made
either in the motion to intervene or in the complaint in intervention that the
21 persons insured survived <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> Bolero, the
beneficiary under the policy, in that accident of February 24, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other parties should not, therefore, be
saddled with a burden of meeting petitioner's complaint in intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That complaint is denuded of equitable
grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not arguably protected by
the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, by the
intervention sought, not only will undue delay ensue, but grave prejudice will
visit upon respondent Simeon del Rosario at least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Intervention is improper.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> We pause to mull over
the reason of the judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
in refusing petitioner's intervention in Case 2419-P.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor's order of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1965</st1:date> correctly states that by the
time that order was issued, the hearing of the case had already terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we look back at the facts, we find that
the motion for intervention was registered on December 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion <u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>ask</u>
the trial court to stop the trial of the case pending resolution thereof. Said
motion was not brought to the lower court's attention until December 11 when it
was set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 11, <u>the</u>
<u>trial</u> <u>had</u> <u>already</u> <u>terminated</u> since defendant in
that case (Equitable) closed its evidence on December 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court was thus powerless to grant
the intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, its authority <u>to</u>
<u>permit</u> a person to intervene is delimited by the provisions of Section 2,
Rule 12, Rules of Court - "before or during a trial".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And trial is here used in a restricted sense
and refers to "the period for the introduction of evidence by both
parties".<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On top of all these is the fact that the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, on <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="11">November
 8, 1966</st1:date>, had already rendered its judgment on the merits in favor
of Simeon del Rosario and against Equitable in the principal case (Case
2419-P).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be remembered that <span class="SpellE">Equitable's</span> appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was
dismissed by the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 37347-R), and on further appeal
to this Court (L-28714; was likewise dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although, of course, the insurance company motion for reconsideration is
still under advisement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point to be
stressed is that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
is now bereft of authority to grant intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court may no longer <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> reopen the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no more principal proceeding in the
trial court wherein petitioner can intervene.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that is incumbent upon the lower court is to wait for this Court's
final decision on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, said Case 2419-P enters into the stage of execution of the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, "intervention

existing litigation".<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> The

record that would permit this Court to tag the order of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in its Case 2419-P denying
