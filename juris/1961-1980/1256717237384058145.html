				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The owners of a 6-hectare land,which forms part of Hacienda Florentino 
located in Buguey, Cagayan, filed a petition before the Court of Agrarian 
Relations praying that they be allowed to separate from their landholdings the 
tenants named therein for having failed to deliver to them their share of the 
palay crop corresponding to the agricul tural years 1952-1953 and 1953-1954. 
After trial on the merits, the court rendered decision granting the authority 
requested. The tenants named therein did not appeal, and so the decision became 
final and executory. However, the court stated in the decision that the 
dispossession of the tenants should be made subject to the provisions of Section 
22 of Republic Act No. 1199, and to carry out this directive, an appraisal 
committee was created composed of the provincial treasurer, the provincial 
commander of the constabulary, and one Luis Florentino, charged with the duty to 
appraise "the value of the improvements, expenses for clearing the land, 
seedlings, planting and cultivation, and damages suffered by respondents."
<p>Acting on this instruction, the committee conducted an ocular inspection of 
the 6-hectare landholding of the tenants and thereafter submitted its report to 
the court. On June 3, 1957, the court, presided over by Judge Pastor L. de 
Guzman, issued a resolution adopting integrally the report and awarded to the 
tenants an indemnity in the total sum of P5,510.35 which the landowners must pay 
before effecting the ejectment of said tenants. Dissatisfied with this 
resolution, the landowners interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p>Petitioners pose the following issues in refutation of the resolution of the 
trial court: (1) Did the court <i>a quo</i> act legally when it ordered the 
landowners to indemnify the tenants for the full value of the rice crop existing 
on the land as well as for the full value of the fruit trees planted thereon and 
their respective produce?; (2) Did it act legally when it awarded the tenants an 
indemnity for the value of their house and granary built on their landholdings? 
and (3) Is the order of the court <i>a quo</i> awarding the tenants an indemnity 
of P1,200.00 for clearing fruit land and the amount of P540.00 for clearing 
talahib land supported by the facts and the law?</p>
<p>It should be stated at the outset that the decision of the agrarian court 
authorizing the landowners to terminate their relation with their tenants merely 
contains the condition that the same shall be subject to the pertinent 
provisions of Section 22 of Republic Act No. 1199. These provisions are 
contained in paragraphs 3 and 4 of said section which provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(3) The tenant's dwelling shall not, without his consent, be removed from 
the lot assigned' to him by the landholder, unless there is a severance of the 
tenancy relationship between them as provided under Section nine, or unless the 
tenant is ejected for cause, and only after the expiration of forty-five days 
following such severance of relationship or dismissal for cause.</p>
<p>"If the tenant is dismissed without just cause and he is constrained to work 
elsewhere, he may choose either to remove his dwelling at the landholder's cost 
or demand the value of the same from the landholder at the time of the unjust 
dismissal.</p>
<p>"(4) The tenant shall have the right to be indemnified for his labor and 
expenses in the cultivation, planting, or harvesting and other incidental 
expenses for the improvement of the crop raised in case he is dispossessed of 
his holdings, whether such dismissal is for a just cause or not provided the 
crop still exists at the time of the dispossession."</p></blockquote>
<p>How did the appraisal committee carry out the instruction of the court <i>a 
quo</i> relative to the implementation of the pertinent portion of its decision? 
It proceeded to determine not only the reasonable value of the dwelling of the 
tenants and of the value of their labor, expenses in the cultivation, planting, 
or harvesting and other incidental expenses for the improvement of the crop 
standing thereon at the time of their dispossession, as prescribed in Section 
22, but also the value of the fruit trees existing on the land and their 
respective produce for the agricultural year 1956-1957, as well as the expenses 
for clearing the land, whether it is fruit land or <i>talahib</i> land, which 
are not contemplated in the aforesaid section. Thus, the following is a 
<i>resume</i> of the appraisal made oy the committee:</p>

<p>Petitioners contend that this is unfair not only because it is not within the 
purview of the law but because it is tantamount to giving the tenants an 
indemnity which is much more than the value of the land. There is merit in this 
contention. It is obvious that the tenants cannot be given more than what it is 
awarded to them in the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations and the only 
thing that was provided for therein is that the ejectment should be subject to 
the provisions of Section 22 of Republic Act No. 1199. These provisions are 
(<i>a</i>) that the tenant's dwelling cannot be removed from his landholding 
without his consent unless-there is a severance of the tenancy relationship 
between them as provided for by law, or unless the tenant is entitled to be 
indemnified, and (<i>b</i>) that the tenant should be indemnified for his labor 
and expenses in the cultivation, planting, or harvesting and other incidental 
expenses for the improvement of the crop raised, provided the crop still exists 
at the time of his dispossession. Said section does not provide for indemnity 
for the value of permanent improvements existing on the land, other than tfte 
tenant's dwelling, nor for the expenses in clearing the same upon taking 
possession thereof originally by the tenant, as was done by the appraisal 
committee. Such being the case, any award that may be made with regard to the 
value of said permanent improvements, or the expenses for the clearing of the 
land, whether fruit land or <i>talahib</i> land, is improper and unauthorized, 
and so the court <i>a quo</i> erred in including in the award an indemnity for 
the items abovementioned.</p>
<p>The provision relative to the dwelling of a tenant has also been misconceived 
by the court <i>a quo</i>. It has apparently the impression that in case of 
severance of the tenancy relationship, whether for cause or otherwise, the 
tenant is entitled to indemnity. Such impression is incorrect, for Section 22, 
paragraph 3, provides that <i>only</i> when the tenant is ejected <i>without 
cause</i> is he entitled to indemnity for his dwelling, and not otherwise. In 
the present case, the tenants were ejected for cause, and so they are not 
entitled to indemnity.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we find that the tenants are only entitled to indemnity for 
their labor and expenses in the cultivation, planting; or harvesting of the crop 
raised on the land at the time of their dispossession which, according to the 
appraisal committee, amounts to P280.00.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is hereby modified in the sense that 
respondents-tenants are only entitled to an indemnity of P280.00 being the value 
of the crop existing at the time of their dispossession. In all other respects, 
the resolution is reversed. The right of the tenants to sue for indemnity for 
permanent improvements is reserved. No costs.</p>
