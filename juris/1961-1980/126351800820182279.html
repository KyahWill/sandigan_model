				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner in this appeal by certiorari would impart to it due
process overtones by characterizing the decision of respondent Court of Appeals
as harsh and unjust and thus <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of his legal
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he should so impute to
respondent Court a legal failing of sufficient gravity is underÂ­standable, the
controlling principle as to the finding of facts of respondent Court being
beyond our power to review precluding the giving of due course to his petition
in the absence of a substantial legal question that calls for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is one thing, though, to impart to it a
semblance of plausibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an
entirely different matter to demonstrate that one's plea should be
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, as will be subsequently
shown, it cannot be said that respondent Court of Appeals was remiss in its
duty to weigh carefully and thoroughly the evidence which unfortunately for
petitioner came solely from private respondents,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
who were the plaintiffs in the lower court, in an action for the quieting of
title and damages, as petitioner, defendant in such suit, was declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must have been encouraged by
the belief that the law was on his side as the lower court dismissed the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, to
which such decision was elevated, reached a different conclusion, the proof
offered by private respondents, after being subjected to scrutiny and analysis,
being deemed sufficient for a judgment in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner undoubtedly, to strengthen his
appeal to us, would characterize what respondent Court did as suffering from
the grievous faults above referred to and thus devoid of support in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not view it that way, the charge of
arbitrariness of respondent Court not being made out, the errors assigned
being, moreover, at bottom, factual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
cannot reverse the appealed decision then.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence submitted and the conclusion reached by the lower
court in the action for quieting of title with damages was set forth in the
appealed decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"[It resulting]:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the evidence of the plaintiffs consisting
in the testimonies of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodocia</span> <span class="SpellE">Salva</span> and Rosario <span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span> and
Exhibits A to K, sought to prove that the land described in the plan, Exhibit
I, consisting of Lots 1 and 2, being a parcel of residential and agricultural
land situated in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental with an area of about 3, 712 square
meters had originally belonged to their deceased father, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span>, who had tax declarations therein, Exhibits
A, B, C and G; that sometime in 1924, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. p. 26, a
Chinese named Make Lim had been permitted by <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
to build his house there without paying any rental and after three (3) years,
that Chinese sold his house to another Chinese named Leon Chan, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. 27, and Leon was given the same permission by <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> to stay in the land free of charge but after the
death of Leon, his son, herein defendant, <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>,
built a new house therein because the old one had been destroyed, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. 7; and he went further by declaring the portion
occupied by the house with an area of around three hundred (300) square meters,
more or less, in his tax declaration, Exhibit J; and the area by him occupied
is <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2 of the plan <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I,
so that it was because of this that plaintiffs whose father <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
by the way had died in 1960, tried to talk with defendant, <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>
Chan, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. 29, but since the latter did not accede to
their demand to recognize the ownership of the plaintiffs, that was the reason
why the latter presented this case as has been said on 24 June, 1965, to quiet
their title; but in the face of this evidence, Trial Judge dismissed reasoning
out that, 'The Court finds the testimonial evidence of plaintiffs too
tangential to conclusively prove their ownership of the "land in
litigation", and the "papers evidencing the land in question"
are by no means conclusive evidence of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, no satisfactory evidence of possession
or acquisition of the land in question having been presented, mere tax
declarations cannot serve as a reliable basis for a finding of ownership in
favor of plaintiffs (see Evangelista vs. <span class="SpellE">Tabayuyong</span>,
7 Phil. 697; <span class="SpellE">Garmo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Boyco</span>,
29 Phil. 437), and neither can the survey plan or technical descriptions
prepared at the instance of plaintiffs, the same being self-serving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 1, Rule 131.) (P. 14, R. A.)'"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why the lower court could not be sustained in view of the weight
and credence to be given such evidence of record was made clear by respondent
Court of Appeals in the decision now under review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"[Considering]:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the
testimony of Rosario <span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span>, one of the plaintiffs,
is to the effect that she knows the land in litigation, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.
18, and described it and that this was 'our ancestral home', <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. 19; and this is corroborated by her witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Salva</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span> <span class="SpellE">Salva</span> and tax
declarations, Exhibits A, B, C and G, and that both Make Lim and his successor,
Leon Chan deceased father of herein defendant, had come to live in the property
occupying a portion thereof by previous permission and free of charge from <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span>; the
foregoing proofs not having been rebutted, must go to show that <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span> and after his
death, his heirs, herein plaintiffs, had been the possessors under claim of
ownership of the totality of the property and this must carry with it the
presumption that <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span>
was the owner, Arts. 433, 541, New Civil Code; it cannot be correct to say, as
trial judge said that there was 'no satisfactory evidence of possession'
because the testimony of the plaintiff Rosario by itself, has established the
fact that defendant's predecessor-in-interest had entered the property by
permission from <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span>
and that must carry with it the corollary that defendant has recognized the
possession and its validity of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> and while
trial judge was correct in saying that 'mere tax declarations cannot serve as a
reliable basis for a finding of ownership' (P. 14, R.A.) neither must it be
overlooked that tax declarations prepared <u>ante-<span class="SpellE">litem</span></u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>motam</u></span> may well be corroborative proof of the
bona fide claim of ownership by the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>; nor
was it correct for trial judge to dismiss the case because 'the testimonial
evidence of plaintiffs too tangential to conclusively prove their ownership of
the 'land in question' (P. 14, id.) because neither is necessary to
conclusively prove ownership in a civil action for quieting of title since
under the rules of burden of proof, as appellants correctly contend, mere
preponderance is enough, Rule 133, Sec. 1, New Rules; * * *"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court judgment was thus reversed, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the appealed decision of the
respondent Court likewise containing the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"the property known as Lot No. 2 in the
plan, Exhibit J, is declared to belong in ownership to the plaintiffs and their
title therein ordered to be recognized by the defendant, who is condemned to
pay unto plaintiffs the sum of P30.00 a month from the date of the filing of
the complaint, plus another sum of P600.00 attorney's fees and the costs."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, this appeal by certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
noted at the outset, we sustain respondent Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It bears repeating that this petition was sought to be
bolstered by allegations which, if substantiated would lead to the conclusion
that respondent Court ought to have displayed greater care in the appraisal of
the evidence which, as was previously pointed out, came solely from private
respondents as plaintiffs, as defendant, now petitioner, was declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would characterize
the appealed decision as being harsh and unjust, thus giving rise to a due
process question, this constitutional mandate being a safeguard against any
oppressive or arbitrary actuation on the part of any official or agency of the
government, the courts certainly not excluded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would appear, though, that such a claim is not borne out. It cannot
be said that respondent Court of Appeals failed to give objective and
dispassionate consideration to the evidence submitted before the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No imputation has been made, and
such a thought cannot be entertained, that respondent Court was in any wise
partial to private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is
there any showing as to its being animated by hostility against
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did what under the law it
was required to do in the consideration of the appeal before it and, after its
careful appraisal of the proof submitted, it reached a conclusion adverse to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing, then, that could justify
the fear apparently entertained by petitioner that its decision now under
review could be characterized as harsh and unjust and therefore in that sense <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of his rights to due process.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Nor is the case for petitioner fortified at all by his brief
submitted to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did assign five
errors, but they are primarily factual in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would indict respondent Court for giving
credence to the testimony of certain witnesses for private respondents; for
considering that private respondents had been possessors under claim of
ownership of the land in litigation; for not giving weight to the fact that he
having been declared in default, consequently the proof presented by private
respondents did stand <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>; for holding that
the tax declarations of the private respondents sufficed to corroborate their
claim of ownership; and for reaching the conclusion that there was
preponderance of proof in favor of private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What petitioner ignores is that from <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Mayuga</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> a
1936 decision, the opinion being penned by the then Justice Recto, it has been
well-settled that the jurisdiction of this Court in cases brought to us from
the Court of Appeals is limited to reviewing and revising the errors of law
imputed to it, its findings of fact being conclusive.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
More specifically, in a decision exactly a month later, this Court, speaking
through the then Justice Laurel, it was held that the same principle is
applicable even if the Court of Appeals was in disagreement with the lower
court as to the weight of the evidence with a consequent reversal of its
findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the same effect is
this excerpt from an opinion of the present Chief Justice:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The court of first instance sustained
plaintiffs pretense, but the Court of Appeals considered her evidence unworthy
of credence, and, hence, absolved <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinit</span>. Plaintiff maintains that the Court of Appeals had
erred in the appreciation of the evidence, but the findings of said Court on
the credibility of said evidence are beyond our power of review on appeal by <i>certiorari</i>
and, consequently, conclusive upon us."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Only recently, this Court, again through its Chief Justice,
stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Thus the main issue was
one of fact, on which both parties introduced testimonial and documentary
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor, the trial Judge did
not find the testimony of the witnesses for the defense worthy of belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he give full faith and credence
to the documentary evidence presented by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, 'the lower court had in effect annulled
six (6) <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> documents, â in the language of the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a detailed and
carefully prepared decision, the latter, after analyzing that of the Court of
First Instance, as well as the evidence on record, and the arguments pro and
con, reached, however, the opposite conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the same depended upon the credibility of the testimony of
said witnesses and upon an appraisal of the surrounding circumstances, as
factors affecting the faith and credence to be accorded to defendants'
documentary evidence, it is clear that, insofar as the merits of the case, the
decision thereon hinges on the determination of the pertinent facts, the
findings on which of the Court of Appeals are conclusive upon us and beyond our
power of review."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The correctness of the appealed decision is reinforced by its
reliance on the applicable Civil Code provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As specifically pointed out therein, private
respondents "had been the possessors under claim of ownership of the
totality of the property and this must carry with it the presumption that <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabeguin</span> [their
deceased father] was the owner, Arts. 433, 531, New Civil Code; * * *.â<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Art. 433:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Actual possession under claim of
ownership raises a disputable presumption of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The true owner must resort to judicial
process for the recovery of the property."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Art. 531, on the other hand, provides:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Possession is acquired by the material occupation of a thing or
the exercise of a right, or by the fact that it is subject to the action of our
will, or by the proper acts and legal formalities established for acquiring
such right."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above provisions
of law are definite and categorical.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They need no interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
they need is application whenever the facts <i>as </i>found call for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is true of the instant case as is so
apparent from the above-cited portion of the appealed decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>
