<p class="BODY">Petitioner's misgivings stem from the fact that he is complainant

judge upon averments of "serious misconduct, <span style="">inefficiency </span>in office, partiality, ignorance of the law and

Petitioner seeks in the complaint therein to have respondent judge <span style="">immediately </span>suspended from office and,
after due notice and hearing, removed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge's return traversed the factual
averments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, this Court, on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1967</st1:date>, referred the
administrative <span style="">case </span>to Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Serrano of the Court of <span style="">Appeals "for investigation, report and
recommendation." That case </span><span style="">is
</span>still pending.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1967</st1:date>,
petitioner moved in the court below to have<span style=""> </span>respondent judge disqualify himself from sitting in Civil Case
21-C, Criminal Cases 4898 and C-5, and Election Case 2470 aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there prayed that the records of those
cases be transferred to another <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, either at <span class="SpellE">Narvacan</span> or <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, both of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="8"><span style="">August 1,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
judge rejected the foregoing </span>motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stood his ground with the statement that the administrative complaint
against him is no cause for disqualification under the Rules of Court; that
Civil Case <span style="">21-6 </span>and Electoral
Case 2470 "are now on the final stages of termination" and transfer
thereof to <span style="">another <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
"would only delay their final disposition, make the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">parties

Department of Justice defining the court's territorial jurisdiction; and that
he is "sworn to administer justice in accordance with the law and the
merits of </span>the cases to be heard and decided by him." Civil Case
21-C <span style="">was </span>then calendared for
August 10 and 11, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>move to
reconsider the foregoing resolution failed of its purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case 21-C <span style="">was </span>rescheduled for hearing from August<span style=""> </span>10 and 11, 1967 to August 22 and 23, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner makes his case
along the following lines:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediate </span>resolution
of the problem of disqualification "is a matter of profound importance, particularly
on his career and potential as a practitioner of law; his cases "may fall
by the accident of raffle into the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent
Judge" and he cannot "resign from an accepted case every time it
falls" therein; his clients will have "the natural hesitation to
retain <span style="">as </span>counsel one who <span style="">is </span>sort of unacceptable to the
presiding judge." Petitioner winds up with a prayer that respondent judge
be stopped from further sitting in or otherwise trying or deciding the cases
heretofore mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asks for the
issuance forthwith of a writ of preliminary injunction <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now resolve the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Is a judge disqualified from acting in litigations <span style="">in </span>which <span style="">counsel </span>of record for one of the parties is his adversary in an
administrative case said counsel lodged against him?</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer <span style="">is </span>to
b<span style="">e </span>sought
within the <span style="">terms </span>of Section 1,
Rule 137, Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which reads in full:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1. <u>Disqualification</u> <u>of</u> <u><span style="">judges</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>No judge or judicial
officer shall sit in any case in which he, or his wife or<span style=""> </span>child, is <span class="SpellE">pecuniarily</span> interested as heir, legatee, creditor or
otherwise, or in which he is related to either party within the sixth degree of
consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed
accord­ing t<span style="">o
</span>the rules of the civil law, or in which he has been executor,
administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any
inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without
the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon
the record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A judge may, in the exercise of his sound <span style="">discretion, </span>disqualify himself from
sitting in a case, for just or valid <span style="">reasons </span>other than those mentioned
above."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner says that, arguably, <span style="">his case </span>comes within the coverage of <span style="">the </span>second paragraph of the rule just quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">theory
</span>advocated is that the present (1964) rules for the first time <span style="">provide a </span>broad policy-oriented ground
for disqualification of judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>submission that a judge may now be
barred from the bench in <span style="">specific </span>cases
for reasons other than those enumerated in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He s<span style="">tressed </span>that respondent <span style="">judge, </span>in the factual environment
presented, did not make use of his sound discretion when he refused to
disqualify himself <span style="">from acting in the
cases referred to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the second paragraph of <span style="">Section </span>1, Rule 137 of the new Rules, came into being, law and
early jurisprudence gave no room for a judge, on objection of a party, to
disqualify himself, absent any of the specific grounds for disqualification set
forth in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following from <u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Moreno</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> </span>[1949], 83 Phil. <span style="">286, 294, is expres</span>sive of the rule:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To take or not to take cognizance <span style="">of a </span>case, does not depend upon the
discretion of a judge not legally <span style="">disqualified to sit in a given case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is his duty not to sit in its trial
and decision if legally disqualified; but if the judge <span style="">is </span>not disqualified, it is a matter of official duty for him to
proceed with the trial and decision of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot shirk the responsibility without
the risk of being called upon to account for his dereliction."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came <u>Del</u> <u>Castillo</u> <u><span style="">vs</span></u><span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Javelona</u></span>,
G.R. No. L-16742, <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1962</st1:date>,
from which sprang the added second paragraph of Section <span style="">1, Rule </span>137, afore-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Del</u> <u>Castillo</u>, the judge
inhibited himself from the case because the lawyer of the party defendant was
his first cousin.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The judge felt that if defendant should win, his blood relationship with
defendant's lawyer might cast some suspicion on his integrity; but, if <span style="">defendant be the
defeated party, it might bring unpleasant consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff protested the judge's posture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In upholding the judge, we </span>declared:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Obviously, Rule
126 [of the old Rules] enumerates the grounds for disqualification of a judge
upon being challenged and under which he should disqualify himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>rule</u>, <u>however</u>, <u>has</u>
<u>never</u> <u>been</u> <u>interpreted</u> <u>to</u> <u>prohibit</u> <u>a</u> <u><span style="">judge</span></u><span style=""> <u>from</u> <u>voluntarily</u>

<u>himself</u>, <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>absence</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u> <u>challenge</u>
<u><span style="">by</span></u><span style=""> <u>either</u> </span><u>party</u>,
due to his close blood relationship with counsel <span style="">for one of said parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the </span><span style="">spirit </span><span style="">of the </span>Rule, it would seem that <u>cases</u>
<u>of</u> <u>voluntary</u> <u>inhibition</u>, <u>based</u> <u>on</u> <u>good</u>,
<u>sound</u> <u>and/our</u> <u>ethical</u> <u>grounds</u>, <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>matter</u>
<u>of</u> <u>discretion</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>part</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>

to act upon the request for such inhibition.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The <u>Del</u> <u>Castillo</u> opinion
made the pointed observation that the cases cited by plaintiff are instances
where the judge was challenged – not cases of voluntary inhibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as early as 1931, clear intimation
there was that voluntary inhibition upon sound grounds may be recognized, when
this Court said in one case<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is true that <u>if</u> <u>Judge</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Garduno</u></span> <u>had</u> <u>abstained</u> <u>from</u> <u>trying</u>
<u>the</u> <u>case</u> <u>at</u> <u><span style="">bar</span></u><span style="">, </span>there would have been less
susceptibility to suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, as a matter
of law, the grounds for the motion of <span class="SpellE">recusation</span> do
not constitute a legal cause for the disqualification of a judge."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, the genesis of the
provision (paragraph 2, Section 1, </span>Rule 137), not to say the letter
thereof, clearly illumines the course of construction we should take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exercise of <u>sound</u> <u>discretion</u>
- mentioned in the rule - has reference exclusively to a situation where a
judge <u>disqualifies</u> himself, not when he goes forward with the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
For, the permissive authority given a judge in the second paragraph Section 1,
Rule 137, is only in the matter of disqualification, not other<span style="">wise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Better stated yet, when a judge does
not inhibit himself, and he <span style="">is </span>not legally disqualified by the first paragraph of Section 1,
Rule 137, the rule remains as it has been - he has to continue with the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">So it is, that the state
of the law, with respect to the situation </span>before us, is unaffected by
the amendment (paragraph 2 of Section 1, <span style="">Rule </span>137) introduced in the 1964 Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it <span style="">is </span>this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A judge cannot <span style="">be disqualified </span>by
a litigant or his lawyer for grounds other than those specified in the first
paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This is not to say that
all avenues of relief are closed to a party </span>properly aggrieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a litigant is denied a fair and impartial
trial, induced by the judge's bias or prejudice, we will not hesitate to order
a new trial, if necessary, in the interest of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">was
the </span><span style="">view taken by this Court in <u>Dais</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Torres</u>, 57 Phil, 897, 902-904.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In that case, we found that the filing
of charges by a party against a judge generated "resentment" on the
judge's part that led to his "bias or prejudice, which is reflected in the
decision." We there discoursed on the principle of impartiality,
disinterestedness, and fairness on the part of the judge" which "is
as old as the history 'of courts." We followed this <span style="">with the </span>pronouncement that, upon the
circumstances obtaining, we did not feel assured that the trial judge's
findings were not influenced by bias or prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we set aside the judgment and
directed a new trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Efforts to attain fair,
just and impartial trial </span>and decision, have a natural and<span style=""> </span>alluring appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, we are not licensed to indulge in
unjustified assumptions, or make a speculative approach to this ideal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It<span style=""> w</span>ill
behoov<span style="">es </span>this
Court to tar and feather a judge <span style="">as </span>biased or prejudiced, simply because
counsel for a party litigant happens to complain<span style=""> against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As applied here,
respondent judge has not as yet crossed </span>the line that divides par<span style="">t</span>ia<span style="">lity </span>and impartiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
has not thus far stepped to one side of <span style="">the
</span>fulcrum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No act or conduct of his
would show arbitrariness or prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, we are not to assume what responder judge, not otherwise
legally disqualified, will do in a case before him.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">We </span>have
had occasion to rule in a criminal case that a charge made before trial that a
party "will not be given a fair, impartial and just hearing" is
"premature."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Prejudice is not to be
presumed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Especially if weighed against
a judge's legal obligation under his oath to administer justice "without
respect to person and do equal right to the poor and the rich<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>To disqualify or not to disqualify
himself then, as far as respondent judge is concerned, <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u><span style="">matter</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">conscience</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing notwithstanding, this should be a good occasion
as any to draw attention of all judges to appropriate guidelines in a situation
where their capacity to try and decide a case fairly and judiciously comes to
the fore by way of challenge from any one of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge may not be legally prohibited from
sitting in a litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when
suggestion is made of record that he might be induced to act in favor of one
party or with bias or prejudice against a litigant <span style="">arising </span>out of circumstances
reasonably capable of inciting such a state of mind, he should conduct <span style="">a </span>careful self-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should exercise his discretion in a way
that the people's faith in the courts of justice is not impaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A salutary <span style="">norm is </span>that he reflect on the probability that a losing party
might nurture at the back of his mind the thought that the judge had <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriously</span> tilted the scales of justice against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That passion on the part of a judge
<span style="">may be </span>generated because of
serious charges of misconduct against him <span style="">by
a suitor or </span>his counsel, is not altogether remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a man, subject <span style="">to the </span>frailties of other men.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He should, therefore, exercise great care and caution before making up
his mind to act in or withdraw from a <span style="">suit
</span>where that party or counsel is involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could in good grace inhibit himself where that case could be heard by
another judge and where no appreciable prejudice would be occasioned to others
involved therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On the </span>result of his decision to sit
or not to sit may depend to a great <span style="">extent
the all-important </span>confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">If </span>after reflection <span style="">he should </span>resolve to voluntarily desist from sitting <span style="">in </span>a case where his motives or
fairness might be seriously impugned, his action is to be interpreted as <span style="">giving </span>meaning
and substance to the second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He serves the cause of the law who forestalls
miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the end we are persuaded to say that since respondent judge is
not legally under obligation to disqualify himself, we may not, <span style="">on </span>certiorari or prohibition, prevent
him from sitting, trying and rendering judgment in the cases herein mentioned.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>
