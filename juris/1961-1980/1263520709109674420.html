				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Petition for certiorari against the Hon.
Enrique <span class="SpellE">Inting</span>, Judge of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, the City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aldevera</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Ramon <span class="SpellE">Loseo</span> was charged in
the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> with slight physical injuries
(Criminal Case No. 844-B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the day
set for the trial thereof, because of the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
failure to appear, the case was dismissed "without prejudice to the filing
of a separate civil action" by the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, on motion of the Fiscal,
the order of dismissal was lifted and the case was reset for trial in the
morning of <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days before that date, counsel for
petitioner (the accused) filed an urgent motion for postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same having been granted<span class="GramE">,</span> the court reset the case for trial on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, petitioner was duly arraigned
and pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately
thereafter, the trial was commenced, the petitioner, through counsel having
cross-examined <span style="">all </span>the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On that <span style="">same </span>date, after the prosecution had rested its case, the court <span style="">reset </span>the
case for <span style="">the </span>continuation of the
trial on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, six days before that date, petitioner,
through counsel, moved to postpone the continuation of the trial, in view of
which the court reset it on November 5 of the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1963</st1:date>,
that is, 64 days after the court had lifted the order of dismissal, petitioner
filed a motion for reconsideration of said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by the court on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was again called for the continuation of the trial
on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioner, instead of presenting his evidence, moved that the continuation of
the trial be suspended on the ground that he had filed a petition for
certiorari against the respondent judge in connection with the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the respondent judge
suspended the continuation of the trial until after the resolution of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on the petition for
certiorari filed with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
disputed that subsequently that court dismissed the action for certiorari
already mentioned for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is petitioner's contention that the respondent judge erred in
not holding that the dismissal of the case on August 14, 1963 was immediately
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and that, as a consequence, His
Honor no longer had authority to lift the order of dismissal, nor to reinstate
the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that the order of dismissal mentioned heretofore
was issued <u><span style="">before</span></u><span style=""> </span>petitioner, accused in Criminal Case
No. 844-B of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, had been
arraigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal, therefore,
cannot be invoked to support the plea of double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention in this appeal that the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, instead of asking the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> to set aside the order of dismissal, should have
allowed it to stand, without prejudice to his re-filing the case with the same
court immediately, is a technicality that does not promote the speedy and
inexpensive administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have heretofore repeatedly held that technicalities, when instead of promoting
the speedy administration of justice delay it, are not looked with favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so in this case where it appears that
the setting aside of the order of dismissal caused petitioner no substantial
prejudice admitting as he does that he could have been made to <span style="">face the same charge all over again in a
separate action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present appeal being entirely without
merit, the same is dismissed, with costs, and <span style="">the </span>City Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> is hereby
ordered to immediately proceed to reset <span style="">its
Criminal </span>Case No. 844-B for <span style="">continuation
of trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
