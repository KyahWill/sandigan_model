				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Administrative complaint against a lawyer for misconduct, for 
having allegedly misappropriated or converted money belonging to his 
client.
<p>It is not disputed that the herein complainant, Benito Saco, 
while a member of the municipal police force of Borongan, Samar, was 
charged with the offense of Infidelity in the custody of prisoner before
 the Court of First Instance of Samar.  As a consequence of the filing 
of the case, Benito Saco was suspended from his position, effective May 
16, 1954.  After trial of the case, where the accused was assisted by 
herein respondent, Atty. Donato A. Cardona, as counsel, Benito Saco was 
acquitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The decision, however, did not include payment of back salaries.  So, a motion for reconsideration was filed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 and on November 17, 1955, the court amended its decision so as to 
entitle the accused Benito Saco to collect his back salaries 
corresponding to the period of his suspension,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which amounted to P903.33.
</p><p>Two years later, or on May 31, 1957, Benito Saco complained to 
the Court that the respondent had cheated him by misappropriating the 
amount of P601.22 due him as his share in the amount collected as back 
salaries since their agreement was that the respondent will get only 1/3
 of the amount corresponding to his back salaries for his professional 
services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>Required to answer, the respondent stated that their agreement 
was for the complainant to get 1/3 of the money collected, minus 10% 
thereof for expenses in collecting the same; and that he had already 
given the complainant the amount of P220.00 pursuant to such sharing 
agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>The matter was referred to the Solicitor General, for 
investigation, report and recommendation, who, in turn, endorsed the 
case to the Provincial Fiscal of Samar.
</p><p>The Provincial Fiscal, after hearing the parties, submitted his Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 stating among others, that "In the face of these contradictory versions
 as to the real contract respecting the sharing of the amount of P903.33
 between the two parties this investigator is inclined to believe that 
the version of Atty. Cardona is more credible considering the fact that 
these two alleged versions are all verbal and further considering the 
credibility of the witness who testified in this investigation," and, 
therefore, no merit in the charge that the respondent has 
misappropriated funds belonging to his client.  Nevertheless, the 
Solicitor General filed a complaint against the respondent, recommending
 his suspension from the practice of law for 2 years,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 for the reason that there is sincerity in the testimony of the 
complainant and the respondent is guilty of the charge against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
</p><p>The respondent filed his answer thereto, reiterating his claim 
that the agreement between them is that the complainant shall receive 
1/3 of whatever money may be collected, less 10% of the amount as 
expenses for collecting the same, which has already been fully 
satisfied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In further 
support of his claim, he submitted an affidavit, executed by the 
complainant, to the effect that complainant is satisfied with the 
findings of the Provincial Fiscal and no longer interested in the 
prosecution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
</p><p>As will be seen, the determination of the issue of misconduct is 
dependent upon the sharing agreement entered into by and between the 
parties.  Both claim that each one is entitled to 2/3 of the money 
collected.  The evidence presented by them, however, is not conclusive 
since their agreement was not put in writing.  But, in view of the 
affidavit of the complainant, as well as of the findings of the 
Provincial Fiscal of Samar, who personally heard the parties and their 
witnesses, that the testimony of the witnesses for the respondent are 
more credible, it can be rationally inferred that the complainant had 
consented to give 2/3 of the money to the respondent as his professional
 fees.  The respondent is, therefore, not guilty of misconduct.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the complaint should be, as it is hereby, DISMISSED.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
</p><p><i>Fernando, (Chairman), Barredo, Aquino, </i>and <i>Santos, JJ.</i>, concur.
</p><p><i>Antonio, J.</i>, took no part.
