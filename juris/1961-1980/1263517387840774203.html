<p class="BODY">The said defendant failed to return the <span style="">two </span>pieces of jewelry described in the above receipt or to pay
the agreed value thereof in the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,800.00</span> <span style="">in </span>spite of repeated demands made on
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, she <span style="">was </span>charged with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
in <span class="GramE">an information</span> filed on <st1:date year="1947" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1947</st1:date> in the Court of First Instance
of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1948" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1948</st1:date> while the criminal case was
pending in the trial court, she wrote to the plaintiff requesting him to allow
her pay the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,800.00</span> by installments at the
rate of P50.00 each, payable on the 5th and 20th days of each month beginning <st1:date year="1948" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acceding to the request, the plaintiff endorsed
the letter to the City Fiscal and informed him that he was not interposing any
objection to the suspension of the hearing of the case in order to give the
defendant another chance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of
the City Fiscal, the case was pro­visionally dismissed with the written consent
of the defend­ant on <st1:date year="1948" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1948</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently the said defendant failed to pay the installments due
as proposed by her in her letter of <st1:date year="1948" day="19" month="3">March
 19, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the instance of
the plaintiff, the Assistant City Fiscal moved to set aside the order of
provisional dismissal dated <st1:date year="1948" day="22" month="3">March 22,
 1948</st1:date>, to revive the case, and to set the same for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court granted the motion on <st1:date year="1950" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, notwithstanding the lapse of time
since the order of arrest was issued, the authorities failed to apprehend the
accused, thereby causing delay in the hearing of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order that said case might not appear
pending for an indefinite period, the trial court on <st1:date year="1950" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1950</st1:date> "ordered that the above-entitled
case be sent to the files without prejudice on the part of the Fiscal to
prosecute the same as soon as the defendant is apprehended."</p>

<p class="BODY">When the whereabouts of defendant <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span>
Javier was discovered sometime during the first week of January 1959, the <span style="">City Fiscal filed a petition for the issuance
of an alias warrant of arrest, which was granted by the trial court on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="1"><span style="">January
 14, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been arrested, the said defendant
posted a bail bond for her release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
February 18, 1959, prior to the hearing of the criminal case, the plaintiff
filed therein a reservation of the right to institute a separate civil action
against the defendant and on February 20, 1959 he filed the instant case for
the recovery of the value of the two pieces of jewelry in the sum of
P1,800.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the husband of
defendant <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> <span class="SpellE">Jaiver</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> Enriquez was joined as party-defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="3"><span style="">March 9, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> the defendants filed their answer with
counterclaim, alleging, among other defenses, that the cause of action of the
plaintiff had already prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="6"><span style="">June 9,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> the trial of
the criminal case proceeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
the failure of the prosecution "to prove the guilt of the accused beyond
reasonable doubt," <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> Javier was acquitted
on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="10"><span style="">October 2, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the basis of the
transcript in the criminal case as well as other evidence submitted by the
parties, the lower court, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="3"><span style="">March 21, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, rendered the decision now subject of this
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only issue raised by
the appellants <span style="">is </span>prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contend that since the cause of action
accrued on October 1, 1947, the date when appellant <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span>
Javier was supposed to return the two pieces of jewelry or pay the value
thereof under the terms of the receipt which she executed on September 20,
1947, the ten-year prescriptive period had already lapsed when the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed his complaint in the lower court on February
20, 1959.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contention is without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, Rule 111 of the
Revised Rules of Court</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> provides as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Institution of Criminal </u><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">And</span></u></span><u><span style=""> Civil Actions</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>When
a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for recovery of civil
liability arising from the offense charged is impliedly instituted with the
criminal action, unless the offended party <u>expressly</u> waives the civil
action or reserves his right to institute it separately.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, when the
criminal action was filed against <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> Javier on </span><st1:date year="1947" day="16" month="12"><span style="">December
 16, 1947</span></st1:date><span style=""> <span style="">the civil action </span>for recovery of her
civil liability was deemed instituted with it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not then reserve his right to
institute <span style="">the civil action separately;
he did so on a much later date - </span></span><st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="2"><span style="">February
 18, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interim the civil aspect
of the case was kept alive by its <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> in the
criminal action, from the time it was revived on </span><st1:date year="1950" day="12" month="1"><span style="">January 12, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="">, up to the time the reservation was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Actually,
therefore, the only, periods available for purposes of prescription were from
October 1, 1947, when the cause of action accrued, up to December 16 of the
same year, when the criminal action for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was
filed; then from March 22, 1948, when the said action was provisionally
dismissed, up to January 12, 1950, when it was revived by order of the Court;
and lastly, from February 18, 1959, when the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
expressly reserved his right to institute a separate civil action, to February
20, 1959, when the com­plaint in said action was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aggregate duration thereof is less than
the prescriptive period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the
appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
