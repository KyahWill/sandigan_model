				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the decision of the Court
of Appeals which reversed the decision of the trial court in a suit for
recovery of possession of a parcel of land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
(hereinafter referred to as private respondent) is the registered owner of a <span style="">parcel </span>of land located in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Santol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mataasnakahoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, with an area of 34,263 square meters covered by
Transfer Certificate of Title No. Rt-379 (T-211) of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land
was formerly identified as Lot No. 8151 of the Cadastral Survey <span style="">in </span>the area during the cadastral
proceedings from 1936 to 1940.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent acquired this land in 1946 by purchase from <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amurao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
1961, after a relocation survey of the <span style="">land
</span>was effected it was discovered that its southern boundary covering an
area of 8,591 square meters was in the possession of petitioner, Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Malaluan</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Recinto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time
private respondent filed an action for recovery of possession of the portion
held by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her answer to
private respondent's complaint, petitioner claimed to be the owner of the area
in question and as counter-claim demanded its <span class="SpellE"><span style="">reconveyance</span></span><span style=""> </span>from the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered judgment declaring the
petitioner to be the lawful owner of the land in question and ordering private
respondent to execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> over the
same in favor of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on
appeal said judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals in a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment rendered by the trial court is hereby
ordered reversed, and another one entered, by ordering defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to return that portion of 8,591 square meters of
the land in question to plaintiff-appellant; to pay damages in the sum of
P100.00 a month from the time of the filing of the action until the property is
returned; to pay further the sum of P1,000.00 for attorney's fees; and for
defendant to pay the costs in both instances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A <span style="">motion
</span>to reconsider said decision proved unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for review, petitioner
faulting the Court of Appeals â€“</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS THRU ERROR

<blockquote>V.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>IN REVERSING THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the records that the area in dispute is a part
of the land formerly owned by <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Acar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1918" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1918</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acar</span> sold the same to the spouses Mariano <span class="SpellE">Recinto</span> and Marta <span class="SpellE">Magsumbol</span>
(Exhibit 3-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1931" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1931</st1:date>, said spouses conveyed the said
property by way of a donation <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>nuptias</u></span> to petitioner Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Malaluan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Recinto</span> and her
late husband, <span class="SpellE">Juanario</span> <span class="SpellE">Recinto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, petitioner and her late husband
have been in open, public and continuous possession of the entire property
including that portion now in question which adjoins private respondent's land
on the north.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The adjoining lands have
since then been separated by a fence consisting of <span class="SpellE"><u>morado</u></span><u>,</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>madre</u></span><u> cacao,</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>antipolo</u></span>
and other kinds of living trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
land north of the disputed area which is now in the name of the private
respondent was previously owned by Norberto <span class="SpellE">Leyesa</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Templos</span>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
Hernandez and <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Amurao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these previous owners of the land
admitted that they recognized the fence of the property in question and
disclaimed any interest or right over the disputed portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent acquired his land from <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Amurao</span> while the latter
purchased the same from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Hernandez disclosed
that the area he acquired from his predecessor-in-interest was only that parcel
north of the disputed area separated by the fence (Exhibit I) and that he never
exercised nor claimed any right over the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said land was the same piece of land that he
sold to <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Amurao</span> who
also had only occupied the same area and did not go over the dividing
line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only boundary that <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Amurao</span> could point to the
private respondent as separating the land that he was then selling from that
owned by petitioner was the fence (Exhibit I).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also the same parcel of land which <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amurao</span> conveyed to private respondent in 1946.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the ocular inspection conducted by the
trial court it was found out that the disputed portion and the land adjoining
it on the north (private respondent's) are separated by a long fence consisting
of <span class="SpellE"><u>morado</u></span><u>,</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>madre</u></span><u>
cacao,</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>antipolo</u></span> and other kinds of trees
which could not be less than 25 years old, with a single line of a rusty barbed
wire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the disputed area were
coconut trees and other plants similar to those found in the land of the
petitioner but different from those improvements in the land of the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial court
the preponderance of evidence shows that the area in question has been
erroneously included in the cadastral survey of Lot No. 8151 and in the
original certificate of title without the knowledge of the parties concerned. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As a result, the same description in the
original certificate of title was carried over into the succeeding transfer
certificates of title of the subsequent owners covering the same parcel of
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is confirmed by the fact that
private respondent's predecessors-in-interest and later, private respondent
himself, have all along treated the area in question as belonging to the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What seemed to have prompted
private respondent to get interested over the disputed area was when he came to
learn after the relocation survey in 1961 that said disputed area was included
in his title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously then, the
inclusion of said area in the title of Lot No. 8151 is void and of no effect
for a land registration Court has no jurisdiction to decree a lot to persons
who have put no claim in it and who have never asserted any right of ownership
over it.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The Land Registration Act as well as the Cadastral Act protects only the
holders of a title in good faith and does not permit its provisions to be used
as a shield for the commission of fraud, or that one should enrich himself at
the expense of another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resort to the
provisions of said Acts do not give one a better title than he really and
lawfully has.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, private respondent could not have acquired an area more
than what was actually conveyed to him by <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Amurao</span> which extended only as far as the dividing fence on
the south thereof (Exhibit I).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere
possession of a certificate of title under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system does not necessarily make the possessor a true owner of all the property
described therein for he does not by virtue of said certificate alone become
the owner of the land illegally included.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It is evident from the records that the <span class="SpellE">petititioner</span>
owns the portion in question and therefore the area should be conveyed to
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy of the land owner whose
property has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in another's name is,
after one year from the date of the decree, not to set aside the decree, but,
respecting the decree as incontrovertible and no longer open to review, to
bring an ordinary action in the ordinary court of justice for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> or, if the property has passed into the hands
of an innocent purchaser for value, for damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This was what petitioner did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But w<span style="">as </span>private respondent an innocent
purchaser for value?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can hardly
consider private respondent one because at the time he purchased the land
covered by the certificate of title now in his hands <span style="">he </span>was aware that the disputed portion was not included in the
area conveyed to him by <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Amurao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly evident when he <span class="SpellE">acknowleged</span> as the true boundary the one (Exhibit I)
pointed to him by <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Amurao</span>
between his land and the disputed portion by not raising any question about it
and not disturbing the possession of the petitioner over the area in dispute
for almost 15 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A purchaser in good
faith is one who buys the property of another without notice that some other
person has a right to, or interest in, such property and pays a full and fair
price for the same, at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of
the claim or interest of some other person in the property.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the Court of Appeals underscored the alleged
defects in the deed of sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Acar</span> in favor of the spouses Marta <span class="SpellE">Magsumbol</span>
and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Recinto</span> in 1918 (Exhibit 3-A) and of the
donation <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">propter</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>nuptias</u></span> </span>made
by the latter in favor of the petitioner and her late husband, <span class="SpellE">Juanario</span> <span class="SpellE">Recinto</span>, in 1931 as
having substantially weakened the case of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the deed of sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Acar</span> was not registered
in the office of the Register of Deeds and that the donation <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">propter</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>nuptias</u></span> </span>was
only embodied in a private instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We note, however, that said alleged defects were not raised in issue by
the private respondent before <span style="">the </span>trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was improper for the
Court of Appeals to have considered them as the same could not have even been
raised for the first time on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the claim of private respondent that petitioner's action
for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the land in the form of a
counterclaim has long been barred by prescription, suffice it to state that
private respondent and his predecessors-in-interest have never possessed the
land in question nor claimed it to be their own and if private respondent ever
claimed it after fifteen (15) years from the time he acquired the land covered
by his title, it was because the same was erroneously included in his title.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the defense of prescription interposed by the private respondent
cannot be entertained as it has been raised only for the first time in this
instance.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision of the
respondent Court of Appeals is hereby reversed and set aside and another one
entered, ordering private respondent to return to petitioner the disputed
portion of the land in question covering an area of 8,591 square meters; to pay
petitioner damages in the sum of P100.00 a month from the time of the filing of
the action until the property is returned and the sum of P1,000.00 for
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Register of Deeds

disputed portion from the entire portion embraced by Transfer Certificate of
