over a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 48418 in the names of TOLENTINO and <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span>, with an area of 2 hectares, more or less,

<p class="BODY">Private respondents contend, however, that they were unaware of
the foregoing conditions, the same having been embodied only in the Minutes of

petitioner BANK, and, therefore, self-serving, as held by the trial Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1976</st1:date>,
the BANK made a partial release of P200,000.00 less charges of P6,000.00, which
amount was credited to the account of TOLENTINO in the said BANK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, out of the balance of
P194,000.00, TOLENTINO purchased from the BANK a certificate of time deposit in
the amount of P50,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
withdrew on the said date P1<span style="">00,000.00, </span>and
on <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1976</st1:date>, the
amount of P44,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TOLENTINO then purchased
from the BANK a Manager's check in the total amount of P144,000.00, P135,000.00
of which he deposited in his savings account, and P9,000.00 in his checking
account, both with the Far East Bank &amp; Trust Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, claiming that the borrowers showed no indication of
complying with his obligation to pay the amount of the loan to the vendor (<span class="SpellE">Algue</span>, Inc.) of the <span class="SpellE">Tagaytay</span> City
property, which constituted diversion in violation of Sec. 77, Republic Act No.
337, the BANK stopped payment of its Manager's check at the same time that it
refused to release the balance of the loan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That action was necessary, according to the BANK, in order to prevent
private respondent from perpetrating a fraud against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1977</st1:date>,

Court of Appeals may hand down in the Petition now pending before it (CA-G.R.
No. 07573), and without the necessity of passing upon the issue of delay
allegedly intended by the Defendant Bank, this Court finds that there is a good
reason for the granting of the writ of execution pending the appeal herein - to
deny the issuance of the writ of execution pending appeal will be to deny from
the Plaintiffs the relief from the substantial injustice which they have been
burdened, which injustice started from the time the parcel of land of Plaintiff
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> was mortgaged in favor of Defendant Bank,
and the same will continue for some time more unless the writ of execution is
immediately granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears repeating
that their substantial injustice consists of having said parcel of land
mortgaged to Defendant Bank and said Defendant Bank not paying any single
centavo of the loan guaranteed by the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs are willing to post sufficient bonds, as a token of good
faith, to cover the award of damages of P120,000.00 in favor of Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and of P45,000.00 in favor of Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is,
therefore, hereby ordered that a writ of execution pending appeal be issued
immediately for the enforcement and execution of the DECISION of this Court
dated December 12, 1977, upon the posting, in favor of Defendant Bank, a bond
in the amount of P40,000.00 by Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>

and contended mainly that execution pending appeal is a necessity in order to
serve the interest of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1979</st1:date>,
we denied the Petition for lack of merit and, on <st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1979</st1:date>, lifted the Restraining Order.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The BANK moved for reconsideration and for the restoration of the Restraining
Order, which was opposed by private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of its Motion for Reconsideration,
the BANK claimed that the amount of P375,000.00 would be secured only by the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> property, with a loan value of only P157,889.76;
that the bonds posted by private respondents <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P55,000.00 only are grossly inadequate; that it would be made to violate the
General Banking Act, R. A. No. 337, which mandates that the loan in question
should be used only for the purpose of acquiring urban or rural land; and that
release of the loan would render its appeal in CA-G. R. No. 64130-R moot and
academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the interim, in view of the lifting of the Restraining Order,
a check for P389,000.00 was released by the Central Bank to the Deputy Sheriff
on <st1:date year="1979" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The check was <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>
on the same date and turned over to private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The BANK claims that execution was
implemented with irregularity and haste, with no explanation as to why the
amount of P369,000.00 was raised to P389,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Motion filed before the trial Court on <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1979</st1:date>, the BANK prayed for an Order directing
private respondents to execute the corresponding promissory note in its favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In our Resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="3">March

The BANK filed its Reply on <st1:date year="1979" day="26" month="3">March 26,
 1979</st1:date> and reiterated its prayer for the restoration of the amount of
P389,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">We set the Petition and all pending incidents for hearing, which
was tantamount to a due course Order, on <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1979</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
This was reset to <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1979</st1:date>
for non-service of the notice of hearing of April 16 on TOLENTINO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date of the first hearing on April 16,
however, the same having been attended by the <span class="SpellE">BANK's</span>
counsel, the Court required the BANK to submit such pertinent documents as
would give the Court a complete picture of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its Compliance, petitioner submitted
Application for Loan of Jaime Z. <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span> (Annex
"A"); Application for Loan of Roberto P. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>

Bank (Annex "B"); Real Estate Mortgage (Annex "C");
Affidavit of Undertaking signed by <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span> (Annex
"D"); Letter of the Bank dated April 4, 1979 addressed to <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span> and TOLENTINO
reminding them of the monthly amortization due (Annex "E").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its part, private respondents claimed

that the Application for Loan, which he had signed (Annex "A-1"), had
nothing to do with the transaction in question; that the excerpt of the Minutes
of the meeting of petitioner Bank (Annex "B") is self-serving; that
the Real Estate Mortgage (Annex "C") was executed only between <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span> and the BANK; that the Affidavit of Undertaking
signed by <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span> (Annex "D") should not be
given any value; that the subject mortgage is not yet due and the BANK'S letter
dated April 4, 1979 (Annex "E") is "a worthless piece of paper
coming from (the <span class="SpellE">BANK's</span>) dirty heart."</p>

<p class="BODY">The hearing of May 14, 1979 was further postponed to June 6, 1979
after denying <span class="SpellE">TOLENTINO's</span> prayer that said hearing of
May 14, 1979 be cancelled for being "unnecessary, the facts of the case
being beyond dispute."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We resolved
to impose upon Atty. TOLENTINO a fine of P200.00, and instead we required the
personal appearance of both private respondents <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span>

 6, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT
A WRIT OF EXECUTION IS NOT PROPER IN THE ABOVE-ENTITLED CASE, AGAIN DISPLAYING
LACK OF INSIGHT IN THE LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The critical issue posed before us is the propriety of the
issuance of the Writ of execution pending appeal by the trial Court, and its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>, except as to the aspect of damages, by the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court opined
that to deny execution pending appeal would have been to deny the borrowers
relief from the substantial injustice with which they have been burdened considering
that their land had been mortgaged without the BANK having paid any centavo for
the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, in turn,
ruled that the issuance of a Writ of execution pending appeal is a matter of
discretion on the part of the issuing Court and as long as it is not exercised
in a capricious or whimsical manner, and a special reason for its issuance is
stated in the Order, appellate Courts will not disturb the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals was "most persuaded
by the fact that the loan is intended to buy real estate property, the price of
which varies as days go by."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the other hand, the BANK maintains that the issuance of the Writ would patently
work violence with justice and equity because the property given as collateral
as well as the bonds which have been posted are inadequate, and petitioner
would be made to violate the General Banking Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
which provides that the loan in question should be for the purpose only of
acquiring urban or rural land; and that the appeal in CA-G.R. No. 64130 would
be rendered moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">While, <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>, execution pending appe<span style="">a</span>l seemed justified because of the
unilateral cancellation of the release of the loan by the BANK without notice,
and the absence of complete supporting documents to the Petition, disclosures
by the parties during the hearing and pleadings and documents subsequently
filed uphold a contrary view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
during the hearing as well as in his Comments filed on May 30, 1979, TOLENTINO
contended that he is not a party to the mortgage contract which was executed
only between the BANK and <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span>; that he became a
party only because he was "injured and damaged by the bad faith of the
BANK;" that he is not willing to co-sign a promissory note in the <span class="SpellE">BANK's</span> favor for the amount of P389,000.00, alleging that <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span> had already signed <span style="">a </span>promissory note in November, 1976 in the sum of P200,000.00;
and that neither he nor <span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span> had obligated himself
to put up any additional collateral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bayuga</span>, for his part, during the hearing, assumed a very
passive role admitting that he was but an employee of TOLENTINO who was the
prime mover in the entire transaction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lack of good faith and of a sense of fair play on the part of
private respondents was all too evident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were treating the release of the amount of P389,000.00 in their
favor more as a money judgment, which it is not, rather than as a loan which it
is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They want to avail of the full
benefits of the loan without assumption of the corresponding obligations, or
very minimally at that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since receipt of
the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> amount, they have even refused to
make any monthly amortizations even upon demand by the BANK, contending that
"no amount of the said loan is due.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will only be paid ten (10) years after the execution of the mortgage
contract as interpreted by our Courts."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The unfairness and inequity of this posture to the banking
business is too evident to require elaboration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Funds of a bank are, in a sense held in trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are the interests of depositors to be
protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The collateral the BANK has
in its favor, with a loan value of only P157,889.76, is far from adequate to
answer for the amount of P389,000.00 that is now in the hands of private
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manner of reÂ­payment by
private respondents of that amount remains nebulous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the BANK is not without fault for
this sorry state of affairs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The special reason cited by the trial Court and upheld by the
Court of Appeals, i.e., the "substantial injustice" wrought on
private respondents whose land had been mortgaged without any centavo paid for
the loan, does not exist in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
pointed out by the BANK, the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> property need
not have remained subject to the mortgage, the mortgage being but an accessory
contract to the contrast of loan which is the principal obligation and which
has been cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consideration of
the mortgage is the same consiÂ­deration of the principal contract without which
it cannot exist as an independent contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The "persuasive" factor considered by the Court of Appeals "that
the loan is intended to buy real estate property, the price of which varies as
days go by" was disproved by the fact that TOLENTINO utilized the amount
initially released to purchase a certificate of time deposit and to open bank
accounts in his name rather than pay for the <span class="SpellE">Algue</span>
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of good reasons,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
private respondents have not shown a clear entitlement to execution pending
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, after having received
the loan proceeds of <span style="">P389,000.00 </span>on
February 26, 1979 by means of the execution pending appeal improvidently
granted, they refused to make any monthly amortizations since March, 1979,
notwithstanding the <span class="SpellE">BANK's</span> demands, on the outrageous
claim against all banking practice that they are not obligated to pay any
amount on the loan until the lapse of ten (10) years after the execution of the
mortgage contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, defendants are clearly in default on their loan and are liable
to repay the whole amount with the stipulated interest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
No. SP-07573 is hereby set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
