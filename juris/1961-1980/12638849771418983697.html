of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in RO11-WCU 
Case No. 10345 which reversed the award of death compensation and burial
 benefits to herein petitioners.
<p>On January 12, 1973, Juanita Vda. de Pagaling filed a "Notice and
 Claim for Compensation in Death Cases" with the Labor Regional Office 
No. XI at Cagayan de Oro City against the Philippine Packing 
Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The records 
show that her deceased husband Juan Pagaling, Sr. was employed as 
laborer of private respondent; that he was 43 years of age at the time 
of his demise; that he was receiving wages in the amount of P87.50 per 
week; that the accident (Bleeding Esophageal Varices-Massive Liver 
Cirrhosis with Portal Hypertension, Hepatitic Coma) occurred on December
 31, 1972 at the private respondent's compound; and that death took its 
toll on him on January 3, 1973 at the Philippine Memorial Hospital.
</p><p>On February 14, 1973, the Chief of the Workmen's Compensation 
Unit served notice of petitioners' claim upon the Philippine Packing 
Corporation, requiring it to submit WCC Form No. 3 (Employer's Report of
 Accident or Sickness).
</p><p>On February 22, the Philippine Packing Corporation thru the 
Senior Department Head of its Industrial Relations Department informed 
the Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Unit that its controversion was 
received by the Department of Labor on January 5, 1973.  In its 
"Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness" private respondent alleged 
that the deceased was employed as janitor; was 42 years of age with 20 
years service at the time of injury; that death occurred on January 3, 
1973 at 4:45 a.m.; that the deceased was not injured in regular 
occupation; and that it provided medical attention to said deceased.
</p><p>On July 25, 1974, the Chief Referee entered award in favor of claimants as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"1. To claimant, widow, Mrs. Juanita B. Vda. de Pagaling, the 
amount of P2,000.00 or 1/3 of the total amount for death as her share 
plus P200.00 as burial expenses; </p>
  <p> 2. To claimants, minor children, namely Corazon, Agustin, Lucina, 
Concepcion, and Amelita, all surnamed Pagaling, the amount of P4,000.00 
or 2/3 of the total amount for death as their share, apportioned as 
follows:
  </p>
  <p>Corazon....................................P800.00
      <br>
      Agustin.....................................P800.00
      <br>
      Lucina.......................................P800.00
      <br>
      Concepcion................................P800.00
      <br>
      Amelita......................................P800.00
  </p>
  <p> 3. To claimant's counsel, Atty. Francisco Alas, the amount of P300.00 as attorney's fee pursuant to Section 31 of the Act;
  </p>
  <p> 4. To this Office, the amount of P61.00 as service fee pursuant to Section 55 of the Act."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 12, 1974, private respondent thru counsel, moved for 
reconsideration of the Award but finding the petition for review not 
meritorious, the Referee on August 21, 1974 denied the same and pursuant
 to Section 4, Rule 15 of the Rules of Workmen's Compensation Commission
 elevated the entire records of the case to the Chairman, Workmen's 
Compensation Commission, Department of Labor.
</p><p>On December 17, 1975, the Workmen's Compensation Commission thru 
Associate Medical Commissioner Herminia Castelo-Sotto, concurred in by 
Associate Commissioner Eugenio I. Sagmit, Jr. reversed the decision 
appealed from and absolved respondent Philippine Packing Corporation 
from any liability, articulating thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"The only issue in this appeal is whether or not deceased's illness
 of cirrhosis of the liver falls within the coverage of the Act, as 
amended. </p>
  <p>There is no dispute regarding filiation and dependency.  
Claimant-widow is the legal wife of the late Juan Pagaling, Sr. and all 
the minor co-claimants herein are all their legitimate issues and all 
living with and fully dependent upon the deceased for support during his
 lifetime.
  </p>
  <p>There is also no doubt that the deceased was a former employee of 
respondent as a janitor who started to work for respondent on November 
3, 1952, even before he got married up to his death.
  </p>
  <p>After going over the evidence medical and legal, we are of the view and so hold that the referee committed a reversible error.
  </p>
  <p>We are inclined to hold that the illness of the deceased Juan 
Pagaling, Sr. which caused his death on January 3, 1973, is not the 
result of the nature of his former employment nor was it aggravated by 
the same.  The said illness is not peculiar nor inherent to the nature 
and conditions of his work as clean up man, or janitor of respondent.
  </p>
  <p>It should be observed that liver cirrhosis occurs chiefly in males 
in late middle life.  Malnutrition and alcoholism are the primary 
etiologic factors.  The common complication is the rupture of the 
esophageal varices, which usually leads to death.  With or without work 
the illness will progress and will ultimately result in death.
  </p>
  <p align="center">xxx
xxx xxx </p>
  <p>In the case at bar, we fail to see any relation between the illness
 of the deceased which resulted to his death and the nature as well as 
incidents of his employment as such janitor of respondent.  x x x"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We reverse respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission's decision.  
Being manifestly violative of the controlling jurisprudence on workmen's
 compensation cases as well as the intent and spirit of the Workmen's 
Compensation Act, the denial of petitioners' claim by the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission constitutes grave abuse of discretion.
</p><p>1.  The illness which ultimately resulted in the demise of Juan 
Pagaling, Sr. supervened in the course of his employment, hence 
presumption of compensability is decidedly in his favor.
</p><p>The records indubitably evince that the deceased having been 
employed by private respondent when he was in his early twenties (demise
 at 43 years of age with 20 years' service),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> his illness, cirrhosis of the liver, supervened in the course of his employment.  We pointed out in <em>Mercado v. WCC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 that if after 10 years of continuous work with the company, the 
deceased began to suffer pains in his stomach which turned out to be 
"cirrhosis of the liver," it is evident that his illness supervened in 
the course of his employment or at least aggravated by it.  Thus, in <em>Magalona v. WCC</em> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> We ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"It is now unquestionable that once the illness supervened at the 
time of the employment there is a rebuttable presumption that such 
illness arose out of the employment or was at least aggravated by such 
employment.  Thus, the precise medical cause of the illness is not 
legally significant, as long as the illness supervened in the course of 
the employment.  The presumption of causation or aggravation then 
applies.  The burden to overthrow the presumption and to disconnect by 
substantial evidence the injury or sickness from employment is laid by 
the statute at the door of the employer."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, in <em>Maria Cristina Fertilization Company v. WCC</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> We emphatically reiterated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"It is now well-settled that once it is established that the 
illness supervened during the employment, ... there is a rebuttable 
presumption that such illness arose out of the employment or was at 
least aggravated by it; and the employer has the burden of proving the 
contrary by substantial evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise strongly buttressing petitioners' claim is the rule that 
when an employee dies in line of duty, or when actually at work as in 
this case, his death is presumed to be service-connected and is 
compensable.  When doubts on the cause and/or aggravating factors of the
 illness of the claimant arise, they must be resolved in favor of the 
claimant or the heirs of the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
</p><p>2.  Respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence to rebut the
 legal presumption established by law in favor of compensability of 
petitioners' claim.
</p><p>Private respondent presented two witnesses, Fermin Baconguis, the
 immediate supervisor of the deceased, and Dr. Alberto Sison, a medical 
expert, to overthrow the presumption of compensability.  Private 
respondent's evidence through the testimony of Fermin Baconguis tended 
to show that deceased used to work as clean-up man in the pineapple 
cannery of the Philippine Packing Corporation situated in Bugo, Cagayan 
de Oro City; rendered service 8 hours a day, 6 days a week and his job 
was to clean machinery with water by means of a water hose.  At the time
 of his death, his assignment was as janitor using a broom and dustpan 
to clean the premises of the cannery which is housed in a 
well-ventilated building made of steel beams and asbestos roof and 
walls.  His work was light manual labor and there are many safety 
devices provided for private respondent's employees because the factory 
has to maintain a high hygienic standard, being a manufacturer of canned
 goods.
</p><p>Baconguis also alleged that the deceased was a heavy alcoholic drinker and that he was only 43 years old when he died.
</p><p>Private respondent's other witness, Dr. Sison, testified that 
Liver Cirrhosis is mainly caused by chronic alcoholism and malnutrition 
and alleged that since there is uncontroverted evidence of deceased Juan
 Pagaling, Sr. being an alcoholic drinker, it follows that the cause of 
death is not service-connected.  No aggravation could also be 
attributable to his work because it was light manual labor.
</p><p>The evidence relied upon by private respondent cannot stand to 
rebut the presumption of compensability.  It must be stressed that the 
substantial evidence or degree of contrary proof necessary to overcome 
the presumptions established by law must do more than create a doubt or 
set up non-compensable alternative explanations of the accident.  It 
must be an evidence such as a reasonable mind must accept as adequate to
 support a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p>On the alleged alcoholism and malnutrition of the deceased which 
contributed to his illness, the ruling of this Court articulated in <em>Abana v. Quisumbing</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> is controlling.  We said that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"The mere fact that factors other than the claimant's employment 
may also have contributed to the aggravation of his illness, the same is
 not a drawback to its compensability.  For under the law, it is not 
required that the employment be the sole factor in the growth, 
development or acceleration of claimant's illness to entitle him to the 
benefits provided for.  It is enough that his employment had 
contributed, even in a small degree, to the development of the disease. 
 Under the Workmen's Compensation Law, it is not necessary for a 
claimant to carry the burden of proof to establish his case to the point
 of demonstration.  It is sufficient to show that the hypothesis on 
which he bases his claim is probable.  Again it is to be presumed that 
petitioner's illness, which supervened at the time of his employment, 
either arose out of, or was at least aggravated by said employment.  
With this legal presumption, the burden of proof shifts to the employer,
 and the employee is relieved of the burden to show causation.  The mere
 opinion of doctors presented by petitioner as evidence cannot prevail 
over the presumption established by law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Section 7 of Republic Act No. 772, which became effective on June 
20, 1952 as amendatory to the Workmen's Compensation Act, provides that 
if the disease contracted or injury received by the employee causes his 
death within two years from the date of such injury or sickness, the 
employer shall pay the compensation to the persons entitled thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>Finally, We must again underscore the consistent and 
firmly-entrenched policy of this Court to construe fairly, reasonably 
and liberally in favor of employees and/or their dependents the 
provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, resolving and positing all
 presumptions for their favor, benefit and well-being.
</p><p>The records show that the deceased Juan Pagaling, Sr. was 
hospitalized at the Philippine Memorial Hospital from December 31, 1972 
up to the time of his death on January 3, 1973.  For the medical and 
hospital expenses incurred by him during the period of his confinement, 
he is entitled to be reimbursed therefor, duly supported by receipts, 
pursuant to Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the respondent 
Workmen's Compensation Commission is hereby set aside and respondent 
Philippine Packing Corporation is hereby ordered to pay
</p><p>(1)  Claimant, Juanita <em>Vda. de</em> Pagaling, for herself and
 in behalf of her five (5) minor children, namely, Corazon, Agustin, 
Lucina, Concepcion and Amelita, all surnamed Pagaling:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>(a)  The sum of Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00) as compensation 
benefits and the sum of Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00) as reimbursement of 
burial expenses;
  </p>
  <p>(b)  The hospital and medical expenses duly supported by receipts 
incurred by the late Juan Pagaling, Sr. during his confinement at the 
hospital from December 31, 1972 to January 3, 1973.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(2)  To petitioners' counsel, Atty. Francisco Alas, the sum of Six Hundred Pesos (P600.00) for and as attorney's fees; and
</p><p>(3)  The Workmen's Compensation Commission the sum of Sixty-One Pesos (P61.00) as administrative fee.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
