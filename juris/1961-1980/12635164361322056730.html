				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte finding <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangaran</span> guilty of murder and sentencing him <span style="">to reclusion </span><span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>,
with all the accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span> in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 8, 1959 a complaint for murder was filed in the Justice
of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, against Rascal <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> and
another person whose name was then unknown and was, therefore, charged under
the name of John Doe, in connection with the killing of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span> at about <span style="">six
</span>o'clock in the evening of the same month and year at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dimarao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pagayawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preliminary investigation having been
waived, the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance of said province
where en information against <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> alone was filed
under date of July 31, 1959 (Criminal Case No. 336).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the trial appellant herein
was apprehended, this giving rise to the filing of an amended complaint in the
same Justice of the Peace Court (Criminal Case No. 83).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As appellant also waived the preliminary
investigation, the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance of the
province where <span class="GramE">a separate</span> information for murder was
filed against him and was docketed as Criminal Case No. 487.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty and
subsequently he under­went separate trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, after the trial of Criminal Case No. 336, <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> was acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the trial in Criminal Case 487, on the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Sangaran</span> was found guilty and sentenced <span style="">as </span>mentioned heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that at about 6 o’clock in the evening of
June 1, 1959, in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimarao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pagayawan</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span>
and his sons <span class="SpellE">Amperio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
- hardly 14 and 15 years of age at that time - were in their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, however, went out to look for
some pineapples and bananas which he had hidden somewhere near their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that place he saw two persons - <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> and appellant - one sitting on a fallen tree and the
other standing nearby with a carbine in his hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it seemed to <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
that one of them had looked at him rather menacingly, he got scared and returned
to his house to inform his father about their presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon their father instructed <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Patay</span>, a tenant, and his
other son to go <span style="">and </span>find out
who the two suspicious persons were.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This they did, but upon arrival at the spot where <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
had seen them, they found the place already deserted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after their return to the house, they
heard shots coming from the same place where <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
had seen <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> and his companion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To calm his children Gregorio told them that
what they had heard were mere firecrackers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, Gregorio and his children took their
supper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having finished eating, Gregorio
stood up and went towards the window of the house to drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he was drinking a shot was fired and
hit him on the head, as a result of which he died.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an investigation made by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lumaque</span>
of the Philippine Constabulary, a complaint for murder was filed against Rascal
<span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> and John Doe because the true name of his
companion had not been ascertained at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 20, 1960, the true name of the latter
having been ascertained after he was identified by <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span>, <span style="">the
same </span>P.C. sergeant filed an amended complaint against <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> and herein appellant, which became the basis of the
information filed by the Fiscal on July 25 of the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main evidence against appellant consists of the sworn
statement of <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> now in the record as Exhibit E and
Exhibit E-1, the substance of whose contents was reiterated, by him on the
witness stand, and the testimony on rebuttal of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
evidence, according to appellant is insufficient to prove <span style="">his </span>guilt beyond reasonable doubt,
while the defense evidence proves his innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Laying aside the contents of the sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> taken on June 6, 1<span class="GramE">,59</span>, that
is, five days after Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span> <span style="">was </span>murdered, there is still, with
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span>,
sufficient evidence to sustain conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His testimony on cross-examination as a rebuttal witness is the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>DIRECT EXAMINATION</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>FISCAL LAYA:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to accused <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangaran</span>, you and <span class="GramE">him</span> are good friends.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What can you say about that?</blockquote>

municipal building that was the time when I knew him.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How did you happen to be there?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
he was the one whom I saw who shot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was he alone when you saw him shot your
father?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two of them.</span></blockquote>

tree near the road, it was <span style="">Rascal </span>holding
the carbine but it was <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> who shot my father.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where were you at the time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I was in my house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How did you happen to witness the shooting of your father?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was at the window of our house because our kitchen <span style="">has </span>no walling.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What time of the day was it?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>About
</span><st1:time minute="30" hour="18"><span class="GramE">6:30</span></st1:time><span class="GramE"> in the afternoon.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was </span>it already dark?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
was quite <span style="">dark.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How far were you from the place where you were staying in the
kitchen of your house to the place where you saw the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(Witness pointed </span>to a
distance of about 10 meters)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could you clearly recognize? </blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have you ever seen <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sangaran</span></span><span style=""> </span>before that day?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The</span> first time I
saw them was under the coffee trees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How many did you <span style="">see </span>under the coffee trees?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rascal <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What were they doing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I went to find out whether the
pineapple that I hid was already ripe I saw Rascal <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> in <span style="">front
hiding under the coffee trees </span>and when I first went near them they were <span class="SpellE">fiercingly</span> looking at me so <span style="">I </span>run home to report to my father.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After that occasion, how many more occasions
have you seen the face of <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangaran</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was the only occasion and when I
returned to where they were hiding they were no longer there and a little after
I heard a shot fired.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About that Rascal <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span>,
have you seen him before that night of the incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I saw them while they were hiding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, have you seen them before this occasion?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I saw Rascal <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span>
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He used to go to our place
bringing with him fighting cock.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And you already knew his name?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How about this accused, did you know his name when you saw him
that night of <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1959</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
you saw him, why did you not testify to the authorities that this <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> was the very one who fired at your father?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>How could <span style="">I </span>tell, even the soldiers were looking for them.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looking for whom?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The</span> assailant of my father.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were they looking for a particular person or they were just
looking for <span style="">a </span>particular
suspect?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
<span style="">was </span>a
person.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who was the very person they were looking for?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The</span> soldiers were looking for Rascal <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangaran</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you reveal to the soldiers what you have
seen that night?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, I told them in the municipal
building.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you tell the soldiers that you saw <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sangaran</span> to have fired his rifle against your father?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">Yes, </span>sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How many days after the killing did you reveal that to the
soldiers?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The</span> following <span style="">day we </span>reported the matter to the authorities in the municipal
building.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you mention the name of <span class="SpellE">Kasila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangaran</span> or you could not mention <span style="">that name because you did not know </span>him
before?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When they were
arrested I identified the two accused as the ones who killed <span style="">my father."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">His Honor, the trial
judge, who penned the decision appealed from and before whom <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span> testified, says
the following regarding his credibility -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court <span style="">has </span>observed
Victor <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span> testifying in open court in behalf of
the prosecution his demeanor and his quick <span class="SpellE">expontaneous</span>
answer show that he was telling what was impressed <span style="">in </span>his mind as he saw the events happening without any
alteration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, he was corroborated
in many details by other witnesses and more particularly by Rascal <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> himself."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A careful examination of
the record discloses nothing </span><span style="">that would </span><span style="">justify the conclusion that His Honor, the trial judge, erred in giving
full faith and credit to the above testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant tried to prove that <span style="">he was implicated by <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span>
because of rivalry between them over a lady living in barrio </span><span class="SpellE">Dimarao</span>; that it <span style="">was
</span><span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> who killed Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span>
with whom he had a<span style=""> </span>quarrel
because he had killed the latter's pig one week before <span style="">the murder, for the reason that the animal had destroyed some of his
plants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the trial
court that this version can not be accepted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">be borne in </span>mind
that <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> <span style="">and
a</span>ppellant, according to the evidence, were together on the evening in
question and he had painted to appellant <span style="">as
</span>the one who fired the fatal shot when he was investigated a few <span style="">days after the murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this <span class="GramE">We</span> must add
the circumstance that the alleged rivalry between appellant and <span class="SpellE">Tagua</span> was not satisfactorily established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it </span><span style="">can not </span><span style="">be said that the trial court erred in not
accepting the story given by him and his witnesses and in accepting the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span>
which, in substance, tallies with the contents of <span class="SpellE">Tagua’s</span>
sworn statement mentioned heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The further circumstance that <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumacao</span> had no apparent reason to falsely testify against
appellant shows that the trial court was right in accepting his testimony as
true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> the appealed decision being in accordance
with law and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed, without costs, except </span>as
to the indemnity which is hereby increased to P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>
