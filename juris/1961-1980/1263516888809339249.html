in favor of Wong <span class="SpellE">Heng</span>, his widow, <span class="SpellE">Lui</span>
She, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal in the Supreme
Court in good faith entered into a sublease contract with third parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these subleases is for a period of ten
(10) years to expire in January, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of the decision of the Supreme Court, <span class="SpellE">Lui</span>
She is now confronted with the serious problem of terminating this
sublease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is, however, not an easy
matter as the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> acquired its sublease rights
in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only practical
solution would be for <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She to secure the
prolongation of her stay in the premises as long as legally possible and, as a
necessary consequence, that of the sublease so as not to ex­pose <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She to a claim for damages.</blockquote>

has been paying (and during Wong <span class="SpellE">Heng's</span> lifetime that
being paid by him) as you know, is for the use of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my client’s view that the present
rental of P 3,120.00 monthly is reasonable, but on account of your demand for a
readjustment she proposes to have the same increased effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1968</st1:date> to P5,000.00
monthly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We earnestly plead for your

out that actually <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She is not occupying the entire
land area involved in Civil Case No. 41956.<span style="">&nbsp;

por­tion still in her possession is reasonable considering all circumstances.</blockquote>

judgment we suggest that the matter be left to the competent courts for final

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>) DOMINGO E. DE LARA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Counsel for <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In accordance with this letter she paid P5,000 for the month of
August and for each of the succeeding months thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its part the petitioner accepted the
payments and issued receipts <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, showing that
the monthly payments were applied to the satisfaction of the sum of P15,000
which the petitioner was demanding as monthly rental, until December 1968 when
it refused to accept further payments from the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 12, 1968 the petitioner filed a motion for the
issuance of an <u>alias</u> writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears that the writ of execution issued on <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1968</st1:date> was returned unsatisfied on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1968</st1:date> for failure of the
sheriff to serve it on the respondent within the 60-day limit provided in the
Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1968</st1:date> an <u>alias</u>
writ of execution was issued, commanding the sheriff "to cause the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She and all persons claim­ing
possession under her to vacate the land belonging to the estate of the deceased
<span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos y Canon Faustino, represented by Mr.
Antonio de la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span>." However, on motion of the
respondent, who claimed that the writ was not in accord with the decision of
this Court and that at any rate the respondent’s occupancy of the land did not
derive from the contracts annulled by this Court but from a new lease contract,
the lower, court quashed the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In its order dated December 9, 1968, the court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The decision of our Supreme Court
nullifying the 50-year lease was promulgated on September 27, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She and her <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> had plenty of time to take steps for the
protection of their interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Special Administrator, on the other hand, having won the case, demanded a
monthly rental of P15,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She countered with an offer of P5,000.00 and made these
payments but the Special Administrator issued receipts applying these payments
of P5,000 as partial payments to the monthly rental of P15,000.00
demanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the
monthly rental on the voided lease contract was P3,020.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It is claim­ed that there was no approval by the Probate Court of this new
charge of rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being month to month,
there was no need of approval by the Probate Court as being within the regular
powers of the Special Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
demand for increase in rental is an obvious offer for a lease contract on month
to month basis - for if there was a desire to regain the premises, the Special
Administrator should have demanded the return of the premises and charged the
rental theretofore agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
increase in rental impliedly gives rise to a desire to continue <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-lessee relations should the lessee agree to the payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance by <span class="SpellE">Lui</span>
She of the receipts making application of payment was an implied acceptance of
this offer to lease on month to month basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This being so, in order to properly evict <span class="SpellE">Lui</span>
She and her <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span>, there will be need of new
illegal <span class="SpellE">de­tainer</span> cases for the possession of <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She has been legalized (Cruz v <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span>
GR No. L-11276, February 28, 1959)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner asked for reconsideration and, failing, filed this
petition for mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contends that
the respondent judge acted "arbitrarily, capriciously and
whimsically" in holding that the parties had in effect entered into a new
lease contract when the fact was that the minds of the parties never met on the
amount of rent to be paid for the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the respondent defends the correctness of the
disputed order of the lower court and, as a preliminary question, challenges
the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the instant petition for
mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent's point is that
under section 17 of the Judiciary Act, as recently amended by Republic Act
5440,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court's jurisdiction extends only to "petitions for issuance of writs
of certiorari, prohibition and <u>mandamus</u> against <u>the Court of Appeals</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that the respondent has overlooked the second
paragraph of the same provision which gives the Supreme Court "original
and concurrent jurisdiction with Courts of First Instance ... [over] petitions
for the issuance of writs of <u>certiorari</u>, <u>prohibition</u>, <u>mandamus</u>,
<u>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u>, and <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
. . . ." This was found in the said section 17 even before its amendment
by Republic Act 5440.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is from this
provision that this Court’s jurisdiction to entertain petitions for mandamus,
as well as other spe­cial civil actions, against lower courts is derived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there merit in the contention that at
all events the petitioner’s remedy should be by appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is by now part of conventional wisdom that
an order denying execution, as an order granting one, is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, otherwise a case would never end.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the substantive issue, it is claimed that the
decision of this Court, in so far as it directed the return of the land, was in
effect <span class="SpellE">novated</span> because the parties had agreed on a
new lease contract covering the same property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the respondent argues that there was a tacit renewal of the lease
contract<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
when, instead of pressing for the enforcement of the writ of execution, the
petitioner allowed it to lapse, forcing the sheriff to return it to the court
unsatisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the record to indicate that the failure to
serve the writ on the respondent was due to the intervention of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what the sheriff
said in his return:</p>

<blockquote>"I hereby certify that after several attempts to serve a copy
of the writ of execution issued in the above-entitled case on March 19, 1968
upon the defendant LUI SHE, etc. the same was served upon her personally on
August 11, 1968; that by virtue of said writ, I caused her to surrender
possession of the premises object of the writ to the estate of <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos as represented by the Philippine Banking
Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the sixty (60) day period having expired already and
that no more proceeding shall be undertaking [<u>sic</u>] thereon, I now return
the writ of execution to the court of origin, duly served."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The sheriff's return, it is true, does not explain why he was
unable to serve the writ on the respondent earlier, but if the peti­tioner
really stopped the sheriff to allow the negotiations on a new lease to continue
unhampered, we are at a loss why the sheriff did persist in serving it on the
respondent until he succeeded in doing so on August 11, 1968 - and only the
fact that by then the life of the writ had expired made him desist from
enforcing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand the
respondent’s claim that it was the petitioner which allowed the writ to lapse
is belied by her other claim, contained in paragraph 3 of her answer to the present
petition for mandamus, that -</p>

<blockquote>"respondent <span class="SpellE">Lui</span>
She, through her representatives, called the attention of the Deputy Sheriff to
<span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She’s negotiation and/or agreement with the
Philippine Banking Corporation, as special administrator of the Testate Estate
of <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> Santos y Canon Faustino, and the Security
Bank and Trust Company, as administrator of the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Lo­renza</span>
Santos y Canon Faustino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She took it that her explanation was accepted by the
Deputy Sheriff and on that account the latter returned the writ without further
proceedings</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would appear therefore that if execution of the judgment has
not been carried out it was because the respondent persuaded the sheriff that
there was no longer need for enforcing the writ, the parties having reached a new
agreement for the lease of the premises, and not because the petitioner did not
press for its enforcement.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, to speak of an implied new lease (<span class="SpellE"><u>tacita</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>reconduccion</u></span>)
is, first of all, to assume a fact: the expiration of a former contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the lease contract in this case did not
expire; it was declared void for being repugnant to the Constitution, having
been found to be part of an elaborate scheme to circumvent the prohibition
against the acquisition by aliens of lands in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, such a lease would be a revival of
the former one, albeit not of its period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Can there be a revival of a void contract?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, if the terms (except the period) of
the old contract are revived, Why were there long negotiations over the amount
of the rent?</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the trial court, in its disputed order of
December 9, 1968, said there was a new lease contract and that as a matter of
fact the respondent had been paying and the petitioner had been issuing
receipts for the payments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, to
evict the respondent the petitioner would have to institute a wholly new action
for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, the letter of February 23, 1968 shows that the
petitioner demanded the return of the land with the threat that for any delay it
would demand from the respondent the payment of P15,000 a month in rent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the respondent apparently took the threat
as an offer on the part of the petitioner to lease the premises, and indeed the
subsequent correspondence of the parties, set out in full at the beginning of
this opinion, tends to show that what began as a threat to exact payment of an
amount as compensation for the illegal occupancy of the premises became an
offer and the subject of bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
position of the petitioner became so equivocal that after its letter of July
17, 1968 it was not entirely improbable that the petitioner was willing to
lease the premises if the respondent would pay the reduced amount of P9,000 as
monthly rental, and that the petitioner was dangling the threat of execution of
the judgment as a means of inducing the respondent to agree to the new
rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if this were so, still
we cannot hold, as the lower court did, that a new lease contract was thereby
celebrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the parties
could not agree on the rental, and while the monthly payments of P 5,000 made
by the respondent were accepted by the petitioner it did so with a reservation,
and in fact all the payments were applied to the satisfaction of the sum of
P15,000 which the petitioner was demanding as monthly rental.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, there could not in law be any implied renewal of the void
lease contract, and the correspondence between the parties clearly shows that
there was no new lease contract entered into over the premises in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">In thus refusing to execute the judgment in L-17587 the lower
court disregarded the duty which clearly and inescapably devolved upon it.</p>

<p class="BODY">A s to the petitioner's claim for P 40,000 in damages, consequent
to the illegal occupancy on the premises by the respondent, this Court is of
the view that this matter may be litigated in a separate action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition for mandamus is granted, and the
respondent judge is commanded to issue a writ of execution in L-17587,
conformably with the above pronouncements.<span style="">&nbsp;

The lease contract was originally for 50 years but a subsequent contract
extended the period to 99 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of First Instance of Manila upheld the validity of the contract providing
for a 50-year lease but declared the rest of the contracts (including the one
extending the period of the lease to 99 years) void for lack of consent and of
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal the Supreme
Court invalidated all the contracts "as a scheme to circumvent the
Constitutional prohibition against the transfer of lands to aliens." See
