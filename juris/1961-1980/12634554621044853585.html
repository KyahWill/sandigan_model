				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a direct appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="1"><span style="">Janua­</span>ry
 17, 1963</st1:date>, in its Civil Case No. 46448, <span style="">dismissing the complaint </span><span style="">filed
by</span> <span style="">herein plaintiff-appellant,
said court having declared the action barred by the statute of limitations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts of this case
are simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Civil Case No. 7417
between the same parties in the present </span>case, <span style="">entitled "Philippine National </span>Bank <span style="">vs. Agustin <span class="SpellE">Pariña</span>," the Court </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">First Instance of Manila, after declaring defendant in default,
rendered its decision, under date of </span><st1:date year="1950" day="28" month="11"><span style="">November 28, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="">, with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, defendant Agustin R. <span class="SpellE">Pariña</span>
is hereby sentenced to pay to the plaintiff the amount of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on the first cause of action, P4,966.22 plus
interest at the rate of 7% on the amount of P4,440.00 from December 14, 1948 to
the date of payment plus 10% of the amount due as at­torney's fees; on the
second cause <span style="">of action P16,777.81 plus
interest at the rate of 7% on the amount of P15,000.00 from December 14, 1948
to the date of payment, plus 10% of the amount due as attorney's fees, plus the
costs of this suit."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing decision
having become final, writs of execution were issued to enforce it, but because </span><span style="">j</span><span style="">udgments
thereof remained unsatisfied, on February 28, 1961, herein plaintiff-appellant
instituted the present action (Civil Case No. 46448) before the same Court of
First Instance of Manila to revive the judgment <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
and prayed that defendant be</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">ordered to pay to plaintiff the amount of
P43,355.03,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as of February 8, 1961, with the stipulated
interest from February 9, 1961 until fully paid, plus 10% attorney's fees, and
costs of suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On account of the failure
to locate defendant at his known address, upon motion of plaintiff, summons
publication was ordered by the court below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When defendant failed to file his answer within the period provided for
in the summons plaintiff moved that the defendant be declared in default, which
motion for </span>default<span style=""> </span>was <span style="">acted favorably by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.
</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">Subsequently, Federico T. Beltran, the Deputy Clerk of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, was commissioned by the court to receive the evidence
of the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 16, 1963,
Commissioner Beltran sub­mitted his report to the court, recommending the
dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of prescription, it appearing that
plaintiff filed the same only on February 28, 1961, or more than ten years from
the time the decision of November 28, 1950, sought to be revived, had became
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January 17, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court, presided over by Judge
Francisco Geronimo, rendered a decision approving the commissioner's report and
dis</span><span style="">missing plaintiff's
complaint, the action having been barred by the statute of limitations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, plaintiff-appellant does not deny that an action
to revive a judgment under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, in
relation to Articles 1144 and 1155 of the Civil Code, must be instituted within
ten years from the time the judgment became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant does not likewise question the
finding of the trial court that the instant case was filed more than ten years
from the time the judgment rendered by the same court, dated <st1:date year="1950" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1950</st1:date>, had become
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the plaintiff contends that
the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint upon the ground that
plaintiff's action was barred by the statute of limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the position of the plaintiff that the
defense based on the statute of limitations must be pleaded, and because the
defendant was declared in default the defendant is considered as having waived
that defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the plaintiff that the defense based on the statute
of limitation, or on prescription, may <span style="">be
considered only if pleaded, and failure to plead such </span>a <span style="">defense constitutes a waiver of the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the particular circumstance
of this </span><span style="">case, </span><span style="">however, this con­tention of the plaintiff
cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows
that the whereabouts of the defendant was unknown, so that upon motion by the
plaintiff the lower court ordered that the defendant </span>be <span style="">summoned by publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Summons by publication </span>is <span style="">a constructive process and it is simply
assumed that the defendant had notice of the summons and of the complaint that
was filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
said, therefore, that the defendant by his failure to answer the complaint had
waived the defense based on the statute of limitation or on prescription
because it is not shown that he was actually aware of the complaint that was
filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be dif­ferent
if the defendant had been summoned by personal service - and it </span>is <span style="">actually shown that the defendant had received
the summons and the complaint - that when he failed to file his answer it can
be considered that he waived the defenses that he is required to </span>plead
under the rules of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since in the present case it <span style="">is </span><span style="">shown </span><span style="">by plaintiff's </span>own evidence that its action
had already prescribed, the court may act <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> to extend to the defendant the
benefits of the defense based on the statute of limitations<span style=""> </span>even if he <span style="">die </span>not plead that defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have before Us a case where it clearly appears that a party has a
right but is at a disadvantage and could not <span style="">as­sert </span>his right, and so the court has to take the initiative
in protecting that <span style="">right.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the lower court correctly dismissed plaintiff's
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without
pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
