				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Membership in the bar is an exacting responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, to quote from Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, "a privilege burdened with conditions."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It imposes, at the very least, the obligation of attending with due zeal and
diligence to a client's cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
complaint filed with this Court by Maria Luz <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>,
respondent Vicente Evangelista, a member of the Philippine Bar, was charged
with unprofessional conduct unbecoming a member of the bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged that he was remiss in
attending to her case with the Manila City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office notwithstanding his having been retained and paid for his services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was required to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was an admission on his part of his having been retained, but he
denied any imputation of lack of due diligence in performing the legal services
required of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserted that he had
always conducted himself in a manner expected of a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, there was a
recommendation by the investigating fiscal, that the case be dropped for
insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then and
there, complainant dispensed with his services and shortly thereafter took from
him all the papers connected with such a case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was his assumption therefore that he "was no longer under
obligation to participate in any proceeding in connection with said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That duty had been shifted to the new lawyer
of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> in the case involving her
husband."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, this Court, on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1975</st1:date>, resolved to refer the administrative
complaint to the Solicitor General for investigation, report, and
recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was such an
investigation, with the report being submitted to this Court on <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recommendation was for the dismissal of
the complaint against respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In such report and recommendation submitted by Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
it was stated that respondent was retained to assist complainant in the
prosecution of the persons allegedly responsible for her husband's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was agreed that she should pay him the sum
of P8,000.00 as attorney's fees with P3,000.00 as down payment and P100.00 to
be paid per appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A complaint was
duly filed by respondent with the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was assigned to Assistant Fiscal Fernando <span class="SpellE">Agdamag</span> for preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent presented the complainant and her
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of them refused to submit
themselves to cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
prompted the fiscal to recommend that the case be dismissed <span style="">for </span>insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such recommendation was concurred in by
another fiscal, Roberto D. Cabrera, and the then City Fiscal, Jose <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The report then proceeded in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The primary issue in this case is
whether the respondent was <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> negligent in the
performance of his duties as counsel to the complainant to the damage and
prejudice of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a rule, an
attorney enjoys the legal presumption that he is innocent of the charges until
the contrary is proved, and, as an officer of the court, he has performed his
duty in accordance with his oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In re
<span class="SpellE">Tiongko</span>, 43 Phil. 191).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in every case of disbarment the burden
of proof lies with the complainant to show that the respondent is guilty of the
acts charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, there
<span style="">is </span>no sufficient evidence
showing that the respondent lawyer violated his oath or was negligent in
handling the complainant's case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent personally prepared the complaint of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
and filed this with the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case was set for preliminary
investigation, he was present in no less than 15 scheduled hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He presented as witnesses the complainant and
four other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These, facts are
borne by the case record and admitted by the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 73-400, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1976</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant's case was dismissed
apparently because of the failure of the complainant's witnesses to submit to
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from a
reading of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Agdamag's</span> memorandum * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said memorandum reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the hearing of the case has been
continuously postponed several times because of the failure of the prosecution
witnesses to appear; that on October 10, 1972, the counsel for the complainant,
<u>together with his client</u>, manifested into the record that should they be
unable to produce the witnesses at the next hearing they would submit their
case on the basis of the evidence already on record;' that on October 25, 1972,
'only the counsel for the complainant appeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His client and their witnesses did not arrive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *' Atty. Evangelista was, thus,
constrained to submit the case on the basis of the evidence already on
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts do not indicate
negligence on the part of the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant who was present during the hearing of <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1972</st1:date> was fully aware
that she still had to present two of her witnesses for cross-examination on the
next scheduled hearing."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As to the allegation by complainant
that respondent did not inform her that the case had been dismissed and that he
did nothing to remedy the same, there is this relevant excerpt from such
report:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The record does not
support this claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent met
the complainant in the house of Sgt. Bo sometime in December, 1972, immediately
after he learned that the case was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He informed the complainant then that her case had been dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also informed her that he could appeal or
ask for a reconsideration of the same but the complainant took the case record
from him and said that she has hired another lawyer to handle her case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant admits the said
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also confirms that she
terminated the respondent's services on the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 31-33, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1976</st1:date>)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The concluding paragraph of the report follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The complaint against the respondent
Atty. Vicente Evangelista has not been established by competent evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Atienza's</span>
case is not imputable to respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A member
of the bar can not be subjected to the peril of disbarment simply because of
decision adverse to his client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
serious consequence of disbarment or suspension should follow only where there
is a clear preponderance of evidence showing the basis thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the recommendation was for the dismissal of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is in agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It would be to place an intolerable burden on a member of the bar if just
because a client failed to obtain what is sought by her after due exertion of
the required effort on his part, he would be held accountable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Success in a litigation is certainly not the
test of whether or not a lawyer had lived up to his duties to a, client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that with the thorough
preparation of the case handled by him, he had taken all the steps to prosecute
his suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If thereafter the result would
be the frustration of his client's hopes, that is a cause for disappointment,
no doubt for him no less than for his client, but not for disciplinary
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is more to be sympathized
with than condemned - on the a<span style="">s</span>sumption
of course that he did what was expected of him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the complaint against Attorney Vicente
Evangelista is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of
