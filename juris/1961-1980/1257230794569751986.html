				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for naturalization filed by Te Eng Ling, a citizen of 
Nationalist China. The petition is supported by the affidavits of Estifano 
Segovia, a lawyer, and Gloria R. Benedicto, a school teacher.
<p>Petitioner was born in Molo, Iloilo on August 14, 1933 being the son of 
Catalino Melliza Te Kutuan and Soledad Lim. He took up his elementary and 
secondary courses in the Iloilo Chinese Commercial School wherein he enrolled 
under the name of Ramon L. Te and subsequently studied at the University of San 
Agustin where he obtained his degree of Bachelor of Science in Business 
Administration. Presently, he is employed in the store of the Far Eastern 
Furniture and Hardware located at Iznart St., Iloilo City, where he earns P4.00, 
a day, free laundry, board and lodging, working six days a week, because on 
Sundays the store is closed and he is not paid. On the average, his monthly 
earning may be said to be P104.00.</p>
<p>He has no criminal record, nor is he suffering from any contagious desease. 
He does not have any tax liability, and has duly complied with his obligation to 
the Government in relation thereto. His conduct and relation with Filipinos have 
been good and irreproachable. He speaks and writes English as well as the local 
dialect. He has evinced a sincere desire to become a Filipino citizen. He has 
all the qualifications to be admitted as such and does not have any 
disqualification.</p>
<p>The Government opposed the petition based on lack of lucrative or gainful 
occupation. It contends that petitioner does not have any real estate worth 
P5,000.00, nor any lucrative trade or profession because an average income of 
P104.00 a month cannot be considered lucrative within the standard set by the 
Supreme Court in several decisions rendered in similar cases. The Government 
also opposed the petition on the ground that petitioner has adopted several 
names in hid conduct as student or in his dealing with the public.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the opposition of the Government, the trial court granted the 
petition. It ordered that, after the decision has become final and the lapse of 
two years as required by law, he be allowed to take the oath of allegiance as a 
Filipino citizen. From this decision, the Government has appealed.</p>
<p>It is undisputed that petitioner does not possess any real estate worth at 
least P5,000.00 and that his only source of income is his employment with the 
Far Eastern Furniture and Hardware whose store is located in Iloilo City where 
he is paid P4.00 a day, or an average salary of P104.00 a month. The Government 
has opposed the petition on the main ground that petitioner does not have a 
lucrative or gainful occupation within the meaning of the law for in its opinion 
one who merely receives,a salary of around P104.00 a month, even if he is given 
free laundry, board and lodging, cannot be considered to possess one within the 
meaning of the law considering the present high cost of living and the low 
purchasing capacity of our currency today.</p>
<p>We find merit in this contention. This is in line with the policy laid down 
by this Court in a series of recent decisions one of which is the one rendered 
in Velasco vs. Republic of the Philippines, 108 Phil., 234; 58 Off. Gaz. [11] 
2154), wherein we held that petitioner's income of P150.00 a month considering 
the high cost of living and the low purchasing value of our peso is neither 
lucrative nor substantial to meet the requirement of the law. Another pertinent 
case is Swee Din Tan vs. Republic, wherein we said: "We find a sounder reason to 
refuse citizenship; no lucrative employment. It is admitted that Swee Din Tan, 
with a wife and three children, is a mere employee receiving P200.00 a month 
only. We think that at the present valuation of the peso, petitioner may have an 
employment; but he has not a 'lucrative' employment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>We also find tenable the contention that petitioner is unworthy to become a 
Filipino citizen considering that he has adopted several names in his dealing 
with the public. Thus, when he studied in the Chinese Commercial School, were he 
took up his secondary course, and later in the University of San Agustin, where 
he obtained his degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, he 
enrolled under the name of Ramon L. Te or Ramon Te, whereas in the petition for 
naturalization he filed in the present case which is the one published in the 
local newspapers as required by law in order that those who may have any ground 
for opposition may be duly informed of his desire to become a Filipino citizen, 
he used the name of Te Eng Ling. The use of a different name in the petition for 
naturalization can have no other purpose than to confuse and mislead the people 
to facilitate its approval and forestall any opposition thereto.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, with costs against 
petitioner.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>
