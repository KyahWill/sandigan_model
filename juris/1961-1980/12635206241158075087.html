				<H3>AMADO A. YATCO, PETITIONER, VS.
THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, member of the Philippine Bar, from the decision of
the Court of Appeals affirming an order issued by the Court of First Instance
of Manila in Criminal Case No. 35274 finding him guilty of contempt of court
and sentencing him to pay a fine of P50.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Grounds <span style="">inv</span>oked in support of his plea for a reversal of the appealed
decision are that (a) the contempt proceedings did not comply with the
requirements of Section 3, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, and that, (b) at any
rate, the facts of the case do not warrant his conviction for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"On </span>the
strength of an informa­tion for theft of clothing materials, accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> was arraigned on <st1:date year="1956" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case was set for <st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this date, defendant <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> moved for its postponement alleging illness
on his part - which was granted for <st1:date year="1956" day="8" month="11">November
 <span style="">8, </span>1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This subsequent <span style="">setting, </span>however, was postponed due to complainant <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tecson's</span> not having been
subpoenaed accordingly and again the trial was set for February 28, 1957, when
accused failed to appear in spite of his having been notified accordingly on
time by his <span class="SpellE">bailors</span> - which resulted in the for­feiture
of <span style="">his </span>bail-bond.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1957" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1957</st1:date>,
defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of forfeiture on the
alleged ground that his client was sick on that very date, <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1957" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1957</st1:date>, the accused was permitted to file an ad­ditional
bail-bond raising the same to P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and the court
granted the accused temporary liberty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendant was subsequently notified on <st1:date year="1957" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1957</st1:date>, of the hearing set for <st1:date year="1957" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1957</st1:date>, the corresponding
notice having been signed by Attorney Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Yatco's</span> son.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When, however, on July 29, 1957 the case was called for trial,
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> appeared with accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> <span style="">on </span>latter's
behalf and on behalf of his father, and moved for the postponement of the
hearing on the alleged ground that his father had a case in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The trial court reminded Attorney
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> that corresponding formal notice having
been served his father as far back as April 16, 1957, there was ample time for
the latter to have dis<span style="">engaged himself
from other commit­ments, and prepared for the trial, court adding that it was
not satis­fied with the reasons for his non­appearance and that it was going to
find him guilty of contempt for having, in disregard of the notice served him,
accepted other profes­sional engagement.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There was a proposal to have Attorney Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>
designated as counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for the
accused so <span style="">as </span>to expedite the
hearing of that simple case but he demurred stating that it was his father who
was defense attorney, so the hearing was postponed for 10:30 that very morning,
that <span style="">is, </span>with
two hours allowance for appellant to appear and this was agreed to by Attorney
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was at this juncture that complainant <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> complained in open court of the unnecessary
delay already caused by two previous postponements <span style="">which </span>have prejudiced her considerably in expenses and loss of
time for her going to and from San <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> to Manila, calling the attention of the trial
court to the obvious purpose of defense in annoying her and thus weakening her
case, so much so that the court informed accused <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
to return at 10:30 that morning for trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But when the time struck, it was only Attorney Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> who appeared stating that the accused had gone to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
to contact appellant <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> and this, without the
trial court's permission - which said court resented <span class="SpellE">labelling</span>
<span class="SpellE">accused's</span> act as highly con­temptuous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, at about <st1:time minute="2" hour="12">12:02 p.m.</st1:time> before the presiding judge could leave <span style="">the rostrum, accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> appeared, still minus his counsel, the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This much delayed appearance
the trial court considered as having been purposely done so as to prevent again
the trial from proceeding for lack of time, so much so </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the court directed the bailiff to have the accused arrested - which was
<span class="GramE">effected</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There and there, forthwith, the trial judge issued an order the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which is as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, considering that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> has no right to accept a professional
engagement when this case was set for trial as far back as April, 1957, and it
is now 11:00 a.m. and he is not here, and considering that accused failed to
appear without giving notice to this Court, this Court hereby declare accused
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> in contempt of court, and pun­ishes said
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> by
imposing upon him a fine of P50.00 which must be paid within two (2) days from
receipt of this order, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and
accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> by an imprisonment of ten (10)
days.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Let a warrant of arrest issue for accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>."</p>

<blockquote>On July 31, 1957, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration to
set aside the aforementioned order of July 29 on the alleged ground that the
circumstances leading to the issuance of that order constituted constructive
contempt and he was not, therefore, properly charged, even heard, under Section
3, Rule 64, Rules of Court and added that he had satisfactorily explained his
failure to appear before the said court on July 29, 1957, and that he had no
intention of disobeying the court's order."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellant that the charge against him and of
which he was found guilty is one for indirect contempt which, according to
Section 3, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, may be punished only after a written
charge has been filed against the <span class="SpellE">contemner</span> and only
after the latter has been heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Rivera vs. Arellano, 88 Phil. 744, Francisco vs. Enriquez, G.R.
No.</span> L-7058, <st1:date year="1954" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1954</st1:date>
and L-10074, <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1959</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>are of the opinion, however, that upon
the undisputed facts before us there was a written charge for contempt against
appellant, in connection with which he had been given full opportunity to purge
himself of said charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever merit there might be in appellant's contention that the
order of Judge Lucero of July 29, 1957 was issued without the benefit of a
written charge nor of a hearing has lost its force in view of the fol­lowing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the contents of said order sufficiently
apprised appellant of the fact that he was being charged with indirect contempt
consisting in his failure to ap­pear on the date set for the trial of the
criminal case in which he had appeared as counsel for the accused and in
connection with which he had been duly served with notice months before, and
(b) after the issuance of said order he filed a <span style="">motion </span>to have it reconsidered and set <span style="">aside, </span>in <span style="">connection
with </span>which motion he was given full opportunity <span style="">to </span>explain why he should not <span style="">be </span>held in con­tempt of court; (c) it was only after said
hearing that Judge Lucero issued another resolution dated August 1, 1957, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court hereby maintains
its order of July 29, 1957, finding Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> guilty of constructive con­tempt and accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> of direct contempt, but reduces the imprisonment of
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> to five (5) days such that he should be
released on August 3, 1957, <span style="">but </span><span style="">his </span>release cannot be directed now in
view of the fact that the bond posted for <span style="">his
provisional liberty has been withdrawn; and fines Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
</span><span style="">A. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Yatco</span></span><span style=""> P50.00, which should be paid within fifteen
(15) days from receipt of this resolution, unless this case is appealed, with
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and upon his failure to do so
and if no appeal is interposed, the Court will issue the corresponding warrant
of arrest.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"For purposes of appeal, the bail bond of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> is fixed at
P50.00." <span class="GramE">(pp. 12-15, rec.)."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That appellant had ample opportunity to defend himself before
being finally convicted of contempt of court <span style="">is </span>evidenced by the fact that at the hearing held on his motion
for reconsideration and/or to <span style="">set </span>aside
the order of July 29, 1957, he personally appeared and argued in support
thereof, answering point by point all the questions addressed to him by Judge Lucero
concerning his failure to appear or the reasons why he did not appear on the
date set for the trial of the criminal case against his client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our view, there­fore, the requirements of
the law have been substantially complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the appealed decision is affirmed, with
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
