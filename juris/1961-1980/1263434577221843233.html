sort for I don't want class disruptions.</blockquote>

neck, headache, palpitation, nervousness and weakness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said feeling was on and off that I just
did not mind it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several weeks I
found out that there was a swelling part in my neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to get tired easily, and experienced
irritability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could no longer do the
work which I used to do like lifting of heavy things, desks and tables for
example.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The moment that I do it I have
to suffer from great palpitation, weakness, nervousness, accompanied by head
ache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I conÂ­sulted the doctor I was
found out to have goiter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was given
some sort of treatment thinking that it could be removed without being
operated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However such medication served
only as a reliever but not cure.</blockquote>

dominated by frontal head ache, palpitation, weakness, nervousness, dizziness,
colds and irritability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time in
addition to goiter, I was found to have another ailment and that is <u><span style="">sinusitis</span></u><span style="">, </span>the cause of which is due to allergy to chalk, dust and
staying out late in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
teacher whenever our service is needed, anytime we have to do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we used to stay late at night especially
during literary musical contest, scouting, encampment and training.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such activities aggravated my illness so that
I had no other recourse but to submit for operation and treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am very much susceptible to terrible colds
which usually result to <u>bronchitis</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On March 12, 1975, the
Acting Referee dismissed the claim of petitioner on the ground that her
illnesses had no causal relation with the nature of her work with respondent
employer (pp. 16-17, WCC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner filed a motion
for reconsideration (pp. 9-12, WCC rec.); but the same was denied on December
15, 1975 by the Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Unit (p. 8, WCC rec.), who
immediately ordered the elevation of the records to the respondent Commission
for its review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 6, 1976, the respondent Commission affirmed the
dismissal order for the reasons that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the illnesses of sinusitis and goiter can neither be
caused nor aggravated by employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sinusitis is due to simple colds caused by virus infection while goiter
is the enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by lack of iodine in the food
and drinking water taken x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
and that with respect to petitioner's bronchitis, the same "is <span style="">caused by bacterial infection and it occurred
at a time when claimant was not working, because she was then <span class="SpellE">enroute</span> to resume her work, hence, the theory of causation
and/or aggravation cannot apply."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, this petition
which WE subsequently treated as a special civil action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records indubitably show, and WE so rule, that the respondent
Commission committed a grave abuse of discretion in affirming the Acting
Referee's dismissal order, which WE find patently contrary to law and
controlling jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is indisputable that the illnesses of petitioner supervened
in the course of her employment with respondent employer, it appearing that she
was in good health, having undergone and passed the required physical examination,
when she started work with respondent employer on October 1, 1959; and in 1973,
or after a period of about fourteen (14) years, she was found sick of
sinusitis, goiter and chronic bronchitis, for which reason, she went on sick
leave from October 1, 1973 to March 15, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her goiter started as early as 1966; while her sinusitis began in
1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That incontrovertible fact calls
for the application of the <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption
that said illnesses arose out of, or were at least aggravated by, the nature of
petitioner's work; hence, compensable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, respondent employer assumes, by force of the presumption,
the burden of establishing the contrary by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was no evidence presented by the
respondent employer to rebut the presumption of compensability, the same became
conclusive (<span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span> vs. Republic of the Philippines,
87 SCRA 443 [1978]; <span class="SpellE">Despe</span> vs. WCC, 75 SCRA 350
[1977]).</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The fact that petitioner's chronic bronchitis occurred when the
claimant was on sick leave does not, contrary to the opinion of the respondent
Commission, constitute a drawback to its compensability for the reason that her
chronic bronchitis was traceable to or was caused or aggravated by her other
illnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as opined by Dr.
Guillermo C. <span class="SpellE">Laman</span>, Compensation Rating Medical
Officer of the Workmen's Compensation Unit of Regional Office No. VI, "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> All of these diseases are of
the respiratory tract or system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears therefore that the case of nasal congestion, 'sinusitis' and the acute
bronchitis she suffered before goiter surgery ran to a series of syndrome to
become chronic eventually becoming a chronic bronchitis", and that
"all these respiratory diseases of sinusitis, acute bronchitis at the
earlier part of her illness, were aggravated by the post operative weakened
condition and resistance of the claimant to such a stage that was prone to
become ill of chronic bronchitis is service-connected (p. 6, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Relatedly</span>, WE have
ruled that an employee as a matter of public policy is entitled to vacation and
sick leave in order to improve their health and physical well-being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The days that they are on vacation are still
part of the period of their employment and if during this period an employee
suffers injury or illness, such injury or illness will be deemed as having
arisen out of his employment and therefore compensable (<span class="SpellE">Aranzaso</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sagnit</span>, 71 SCRA 608 [1976]).</p>

<p class="NUM">3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can hardly be any
doubt that petitioner's ailments were work-connected and therefore
compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
medical evidence (Annexes B, C, D, E, and F, pp. 35-39, WCC rec.) is to the
effect that her illnesses were the result of the nature of her work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, petitioner by reason of her work as a
classroom teacher and principal was continuously exposed to the dust of the
chalk and blackboard which may have caused infection in her respiratory system
and ultimately led to her aforementioned respiratory diseases.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, petitioner's
right to compensation appears not to have been <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by the respondent </span><span style="">employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is barred from raising
non-jurisdictional defenses, especially the non-compensability of the
petitioner's illnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner therefore
suffered temporary total disability and under Section 14 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended, she is entitled to a disability compensation
equivalent to sixty per centum of her average weekly wage for the duration of
her disability which was from October 1, 1973 to March 15, 1974 or twenty-two
weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her salary with respondent
employer preceding her disability was P5<span class="GramE">,112.00</span> per
annum which was her rate since June 30, 1972 (p. 34, WCC rec.); hence, her
average weekly wage was P106.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sixty
per centum of P106.50 is P63.90.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, petitioner is entitled to the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,405.80</span>
as disability benefits (Sections 14 and 19, Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended).</p>

<p class="NUM">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's claim for
medical expenses was for the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,298.70</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Compensation Medical Rating
Officer reduced the same to P1<span class="GramE">,891.60</span> for various
reasons (p. 7, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did
not expressly question this reduction although she prayed to be awarded the
original amount of P3<span class="GramE">,298.70</span>, which appears to be
supported by receipts (Annexes G to G-28, WCC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, RESPONDENT EMPLOYER IS HEREBY ORDERED<o:p></o:p></span></p>
