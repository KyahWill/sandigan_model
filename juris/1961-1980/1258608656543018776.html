prohibition with preliminary injunction from an order of the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, enjoining petitioners from 
proceeding with the preliminary investigation of a criminal complaint filed with 
the City Fiscal of Manila.<o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 2, 1962, the City 
Fiscal of Manila received a criminal complaint of the Department of Justice 
against <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> P. Garcia, together with Jorge B. Vargas, <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Mascare√±as</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Arambulo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> San Diego and George M. O'Keefe (directors of the 
Continental Oil Company) for violation of Section 17-1/2 of Act No. 1459 
(Corporation Law) and Section 5 of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft Law), which 
was docketed as I.S. No. 62-202.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The crime allegedly committed 
arose from the purchase of a lot by Continental Oil Company from the Xavier 
School, Inc. for the construction and operation of a large supermarket and 
applying the income <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> continuously to finance 
its ordinary business expenses incident to the development of its mining 
concessions, as contrary to the purpose clause of its articles of 
incorporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While the said complaint was 
under preliminary investigation, one Gus B. <span class="SpellE">Dodds</span> 
filed a minority stockholder's suit before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (Civil Case No. 6935) on January 17, 1962, against the 
members of the Board of Directors of the Continental Oil Company, to restrain 
the latter from proceeding with their conditional deed of sale of the subject 
lot to one Jose A. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and to take such steps with 
the view of annulling or rescinding the same, claiming the purchase of the lot 
to be valid because it was done by the corporation's directors not for the 
purpose of investing its funds for a purpose different from its business 
purpose, in the sense of engaging in the supermarket business as a fixed and 
principal commercial activity, but for the purpose of immediately putting its 
idle corporate capital for use in a temporary but profitable business scheme 
contemplated to last, and for the purpose of financing the corporation's huge 
financial needs during the time that the corporation is unable to produce from 
its primary business end of mining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Meanwhile, the proposed sale of 
the subject lot was taken by the board of directors after the Securities and 
Exchange Commission notified the Continental Oil Company that such investment 
was contrary to the purpose clause of the articles of incorporation of the said 
company and requested the latter to take immediate corrective measures in the 
premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 24, 1962, respondents 
<span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> P. Garcia intervened in the aforementioned civil suit 
and filed a third-party complaint before the same Court of First Instance, 
against herein petitioners, praying, among other things, that said petitioners 
be enjoined from proceeding with the investigation of the criminal complaint 
because of the existence of a prejudicial civil question created with the 
institution of the civil case, that is, whether or not the acquisition of the 
property from Xavier School, Inc. constituted a violation of the corporation 
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The following day, or on January 
25, 1962, the respondent Judge issued an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> 
restraining order directing, among others, that pending the resolution of the 
application for writ of preliminary injunction, the herein petitioners are 
enjoined from proceeding with the investigation of the criminal 
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 30, 1962, the 
petitioners filed a motion for the dissolution and lifting of the restraining 
order and at the same time answered the third-party complaint wherein they 
contended that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> 
did not have jurisdiction to hear and decide an action for injunction and 
prohibition as well as to enjoin a preliminary investigation being held in 
Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After due hearing, on March 20, 
1962, the respondent Judge issued an order denying the petitioners' motion to 
dissolve the restraining order and directed the issuance of the writ of 
preliminary injunction prayed for in the third-party complaint, which, pursuant 
to the said order, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued against the 
petitioners on April 5, 1962. Hence, this petition raising the issue as to the 
jurisdiction of the respondent judge to issue a restraining order and writ of 
preliminary injunction enjoining the petitioners from proceeding with the 
preliminary investigation of the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court, thru its resolution 
dated April 11, 1962, ordered the herein respondent to file an answer to the 
petition and issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for, restraining 
the respondent Judge from enforcing his orders dated January 25, 1962, March 20, 
1962, and April 5, 1962, in the Civil Case No. 6953 of the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>. Due to the writ of preliminary 
injunction issued by this Court, the City Fiscal of Manila scheduled the 
continuation of the preliminary investigation of the criminal complaint on April 
14, 16 and 17, 1962, but the hearings were postponed upon petition of the 
respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="4" day="13" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
13, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the defendants and defendants-<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> in Civil 
Case No. 6953 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> 
filed with this Court an urgent Motion <span class="GramE">For</span> Stay, 
praying that the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the writ of 
preliminary injunction be held in abeyance and that they be given opportunity to 
give their side. But since the writ of preliminary injunction was already 
issued, the respondents filed a motion on April 17, 1962, for dissolution of the 
preliminary injunction on the ground that the writs of injunction and 
prohibition were sought by them from the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, not through a complaint but through a third-party 
complaint and that a prejudicial civil question was 
raised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subsequently, a motion was filed 
by petitioners praying to set aside the order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span> dated July 17, 1962 granting the motion for 
exclusion of defendants and third-party plaintiffs from Civil Case No. 6953. We 
decided to defer action on these various motions filed by the parties until the 
final resolution of the case on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The main issue now before this 
Court is: Can the Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issue a restraining order and writ of preliminary 
injunction enjoining the City Fiscal of Manila from proceeding with the 
preliminary investigation of a criminal complaint if before the former a civil 
action with prejudicial question is raised?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the issue of jurisdiction to 
take cognizance of the petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary 
injunction, it is already a settled rule that the jurisdiction or authority of 
courts of first instance to control or restrain acts by means of writ of 
injunction is limited to acts which are being committed or about to be committed 
within the territorial boundaries of their respective provinces and districts.

Cigarette Manufacturing Co., Inc. v.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">The National 
Administrator of Regional Office No. 2, etc., et al, G. R. No.</span> L-20491, 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 31, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
the cases cited therein)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention of the respondents 
that the decisions of this Court cited in the Alhambra Cigar and Cigarette case, 
supra, do not apply in the instant case because they sought the writs of 
injunction and prohibition from the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> not through a complaint but through a third-party 
complaint, is untenable for we agree with the observation of the Solicitor 
General that there is no basic difference and fundamental reason for making a 
distinction in the issuance of the writ whether through an original complaint or 
third-party complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Another point to be considered is 
that, "as a general rule, an injunction will not be granted to restrain a 
criminal prosecution." (<span class="SpellE">Kwong</span> Sing v. City of Manila, 
41 Phil. 103; <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pe√±aflorida</span>, 101 Phil. 886; University of the Philippines 
v. City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18562, </span></span><st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1961"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 31, 
1961</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">; and Lava v. Gonzales, G.R. 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-23048, 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 31, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We do not have to discuss whether 
there is a prejudicial question involved in this case, for even assuming that 
there is, still the Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> cannot enjoin the City Fiscal of Manila from 
proceeding with the preliminary investigation of the complaint, the latter being 
outside of the territorial jurisdiction of the former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the petition is hereby granted
