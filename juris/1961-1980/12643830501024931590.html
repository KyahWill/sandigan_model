				<BR><BR><div align=""><o:smarttagtype name="date" namespaceuri="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"></o:smarttagtype><div class="Section1"><p>This is an appeal from a resolution of the Social Security Commission. 
Permitted by the Social Security Act<span class="GramE">,<span class="style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style1"><sup>1]</sup></span> 
it was addressed to the Court of Appeals. However, having found no factual 
issues, said Court certified the record to this Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The papers disclose that on <st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1958">January 
22, 1958</st1:date>, the Administrator of the Social Security System notified 
the Up-To-Date Shirt Factory that it was compulsorily covered by the System, 
effective September 1957, and should accomplish certain blank forms in 
accordance with the proper instructions. The factory objected to the coverage 
and did not want to pay contributions-alleging that it had not been in operation 
<u>for at least two years</u> before September 1957.</p>
<p>The statute applicable to the case is section 9 of Republic Act 1161, as 
amended, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Compulsory coverage.—Coverage in the System shall lie compulsory x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. Provided That the Commission 
may not compel any employer to become a member of the System unless he shall 
have been in operation for at least two years x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p></blockquote>
<p>The controversy was submitted in due course, to the Social Security 
Commission wherein both parties agreed to certain facts, the most salient of 
which were that,</p>
<p>Up-To-Date Shirt Factory began its business in April 1947, after having 
registered in the Bureau of Commerce<span class="GramE">,<span class="style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style1"><sup>2]</sup></span> 
under the sole ownership (and management) of <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span>; that up to the time of submission, it is (and has been) 
engaged in the same nature of business and used the same business name with the 
same <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span> in charge of 
operation and management; that on June 17, 1958, the Up-to-Date Shirt Factory 
was first registered as a partnership between <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Boc</span> and another Chinaman.</p>
<p>The Commission declared that the Factory was covered. <span class="GramE">Hence 
this appeal.</span></p>
<p>The Factory's position rested on the assumption that as partnership operating 
it was formed only <u>in April 1957</u>, it could not be legally held to have 
been in operation for <u>two</u> <u>years</u> before September 1957.</p>
<p>The Social Security Commission, for the reasons explained in its Resolution, 
now under review (pages 40-44, Record on Appeal), refused to believe that the 
partnership had been actually formed in April 1957. It declared that the 
partnership was formed only in June <span class="GramE">1958,</span> <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e. after the coverage and liability had accrued. It 
pointed out that the articles had been signed only in <st1:date month="6" day="6" year="1958">June 6, 1958</st1:date>, and registered ten days later with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>We agree with those <span class="GramE">reasons<span class="style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style1"><sup>3]</sup></span> ; 
but we do not repeat them here, because even supposing that the partnership 
agreement actually took place in April 1957, the situation would be: whereas the 
business was operated from 1947 to April 1957 by <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Boc</span>, it continued to be operated under one business 
name, and by the same <span class="SpellE">Kee</span> <span class="SpellE">Boc</span> "for the partnership", up to the submission of the 
controversy. As the Commission says, "the transformation of petitioner 
(Up-To-Date Shirt Factory) from a single proprietorship to a partnership was a 
painless process. The name of the establishment was not changed; the nature of 
the business remains the same; the assets and liabilities as well as the 
employees of the old firm were carried over to the new establishment. The only 
changes were in the form of organization and the assumption of a new 
personality. There was not even attempt to dissolve the former entity and to 
transfer its assets and liabilities to Petitioner by positive act. All that was 
done was for petitioner (partnership) to enter into the management of the 
business into place of its predecessor."</p>
<p>In the circumstances, our opinion and views in Laguna Transportation Co. Inc. 
vs. Social Security System, L-14606, <st1:date month="4" day="28" year="1960">April 28, 1960</st1:date>, must be applied. There we held that, for 
the purpose of computing the statutory two-year period ( business operation), 
the conversion of a partnership into a corporation does not dissolve the 
continuity of operation, where the evidence shows no change of the business, 
except in the form of organization. In that case, the transportation company 
argued that the years it hail been functioning <u>as a partnership </u>should 
not be tied to the years it operated <u>as a corporation</u>. That contention we 
rejected, explaining through Mr. Justice Barrera that:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"To adopt petitioner's argument would defeat, rather than promote, the ends 
for which the Social Security Act was enacted. An employer could easily 
circumvent the statute by simply changing his form of organization every other 
year and then claim exemption from contribution to the System as required, on 
the theory that, as a new entity, it has not been in operation for a period of 
at least 2 years. The door to fraudulent circumvention of the statute would, 
thereby, be opened."</p></blockquote>
<p>For these reasons, we conclude that the Up-To-Date Shirt Factory has been in 
operation for at least two years prior to <st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1957">September 1, 1957</st1:date>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the resolution of the Social Security Commission must be, and is 
hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
