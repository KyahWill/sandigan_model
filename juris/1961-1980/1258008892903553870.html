<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On October 23, 1934 <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> filed, with the 
Bureau of Lands, Sales Application No. 19302 for a piece of public land located 
in <span class="SpellE">Cabasagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, containing an area of approximately 100 hectares. The 
application having been approved, public auction was conducted and the land was 
awarded to <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> who was the highest bidder. In 1951 <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> died. Antonio 
<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, his son, purchased from his co-heirs their 
right to the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Meanwhile, the Bureau of Lands 
surveyed the land applied for and subdivided it into Lots Nos. 807, 808, and 
809. Lot No. 809 comprising 61.2089 hectares was allotted to <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="22" year="1951"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 22, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
Director of Lands issued to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> an 
order denominated "Succession and Issuance of Patent", the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"WHEREFORE, the survey of the 
land having been executed and there being no adverse claim still pending 
determination, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that patent be issued to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A month later Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span>, thru <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span>, filed B.L. Conflict No. 215(N) claiming one-half of 
Lot No. 809 and alleging that said Lot was originally applied for by one Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Constantino</span> who sold his right thereon to <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> and Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span>; that the two vendees agreed to divide the land 
equally between them, that is, the eastern half to Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> and the western portion to <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>; and that since 
1934 they have been in possession of their respective 
portions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon notice of <span class="SpellE">Sarita’s</span> claim, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> 
instituted an action to quiet title over Lot No. 809, in the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, <span class="GramE">docketed</span> 
as Civil Case No. 347-R. Said action resulted in a judgment in Antonio 
Magallanes1 favor (Appendix B to Appellant's brief) but an appeal was taken 
<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to the Court of Appeals and is pending 
decision therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="7" day="10" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 
10, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
the Director of Lands gave due course to Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita's</span> 
claim. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> appealed such action to the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources who on </span><st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
17, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
sustained the decision of the Director of Lands. On </span><st1:date month="10" day="11" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 11, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> came to the Supreme Court on a 
petition for certiorari. We however dismissed the petition without prejudice to 
the filing of the proper action in the Court of First 
Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accordingly, on </span><st1:date month="2" day="27" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 27, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> commenced an action for prohibition 
against the Director of Lands and Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span>. After 
answer, the petition for prohibition was amended to include the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources as party respondent and to annex some 
documents. No further answer was filed by respondents who also failed to appear 
during the hearing of the case. The court then declared them in default and 
allowed Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> to present his 
evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="29" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 29, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
trial court rendered the following judgment granting the petition for 
prohibition: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"WHEREFORE, for all the foregoing 
considerations, petitioner ANTONIO MAGALLANES is hereby declared the absolute 
owner and possessor of the land under Sales Application No. 19302, Lot 809,

It is further declared that respondent Director of 
Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources had acted without 
and in excess of their authority and jurisdiction in issuing the decision on 
June 6, 1953, giving one-half to Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> of the 
land of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> in S.A. No. 19302, Lot 809, 
Pls-13 (Exhibit 'M' ), and in denying the motion for reconsideration and new 
trial on July 10, 1954 (Exhibit 'P'-), and in affirming the decision dated July 
17, 1955 (Exhibit 'R'); and that said decisions are hereby declared NULL and 
VOID and of no force and effect. And, lastly, the respondents are hereby 
prohibited and enjoined from giving due course to the said 
decisions."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals but said court 
dismissed the appeal for failure to timely pay the docketing fee. The judgment 
having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> moved for execution. Whereupon, the court issued 
an order dated </span><st1:date month="2" day="27" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 27, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
granting the motion for execution and ordered the issuance of a writ of 
possession. This writ was served on the heirs of Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> but said heirs were reportedly still in possession of 
the land litigated. On </span><st1:date month="6" day="18" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 18, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> charged said heirs for contempt of 
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the meantime, Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> moved to quash the writ of execution. His motion was 
denied. On motion for reconsideration, the court set aside the writ of 
possession by its order dated </span><st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 20, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="28" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 28, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> said 
court denied the motion to hold Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita's</span> heirs in 
contempt of court. On </span><st1:date month="7" day="22" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 22, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
court also denied the motion to reconsider the two aforesaid orders. Antonio 
<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> thereupon appealed "to this Court on 
questions purely of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The questions are: (1) Could Leon 
<span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> <span class="GramE">be</span> heard to complain 
against the issuance of the writ of possession considering that he was 
previously adjudged in default? (2) Was it proper for the court to issue a writ 
of possession? (3) Were the heirs of Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> in 
contempt of court in continuing their possession over the land involved despite 
the service of the writ of possession?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Default<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">An answer filed before the amendment stands as 
answer to the amended complaint<span class="GramE">.<span style1=""><span class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span class="style11"><sup>1]</sup></span></span><sup>Accordingly, Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span>' s answer to the original petition for prohibition 
stood as his answer to the amended petition. His failure to present a new answer 
would not put him in default. Default in the Court of First Instance arises only 
upon failure to answer on <span class="GramE">time<span class="style11">[</span></span><span class="style11">2]</span></sup></span><sup>not 
merely for failure to appear during the hearing.</sup><span class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> 
</span></sup></span><span class="style11"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[3] <span style2=""></span></span></sup></span><span class="SpellE"><span class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Sarita</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span><span class="style21"><sup> therefore did not lose his standing in court.

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span>Writ of 
Possession</sup><o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Predicated on the judgment declaring Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> "absolute owner and possessor of the land", the 
lower court issued the writ of possession. We are faced with the question 
whether or not the lower court acted properly in issuing a writ of possession 
for the purpose of enforcing the aforesaid judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Regardless of the lower court's pronouncement on 
the ownership of the land under litigation, the judgment itself would not 
justify the issuance of a writ of possession. Such writ may only be issued where 
an action is for the recovery of possession over real property.<span class="style11">[4]</span></span> The case brought by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> was for prohibition, to forbid the Director of Lands 
and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources from, to quote the 
prayer: <o:p></o:p></sup></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> accepting and giving due course to the sales application 
of respondent Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span>, from giving force and 
effect or executing their decisions, Annex 'E' and 'J’, from further proceeding 
in land conflict B. L. No. 215(N) and DANR No. 947 which are beyond their 
respective jurisdictions or in excess and/or abuse of their 
jurisdiction;"<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A judgment in a special civil action for 
prohibition is enforced, pursuant to Section 9, Rule 67 and Section 9, Rule 39, 
of the Rules of Court, by serving a certified copy of the judgment upon the 
tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person concerned. Chief Justice Moran 
has this to say on the point: <o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"The execution of a final judgment in these special 
actions is similar to the execution of special judgments as provided in Rule 39, 
section 9. As a matter of fact, the judgments rendered in these special civil 
actions are classified as special under sec. 9 of Rule 39, because they require 
the doing of an act other than the payment of money or the sale or delivery of 
real or personal property. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<span class="style11">[5]</span></span></sup><span class="style11"><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The procedure of execution is such because the 
function of prohibition is to prevent a power from being exercised without or in 
excess of jurisdiction<span class="GramE">.<span style1="" style2=""><span class="style11">[</span></span><span class="style11">6]</span></span>An execution, 
.e.g., writ of possession, contrary to the procedure set forth in Section 9 of 
Rule 67 abovementioned and for a purpose foreign to the stated function, would 
be void. The writ of possession in question suffers from the same 
fate.</span></sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Contempt<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For alleged disobedience to the writ of possession 
mentioned above, the heirs of Leon <span class="SpellE">Sarita</span> were charged 
for contempt. The court however denied the motion for contempt. We see no error 
in the court's action. Needless to say, said heirs could not be bound by a void 
writ (<span class="SpellE">Caluag</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>, 82 
Phil. 8).<o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></sup></strong><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, the order of June 20, 1963 setting aside the writ 
of possession; the order of June 28, 1963 denying the motion to hold the heirs
