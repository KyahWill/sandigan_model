dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff had filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="10">October
 3, 1967</st1:date> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
its complaint to recover the <span style="">sum </span>of
P238,500.00 representing the unpaid price of 300 units of fire extinguishers
sold and delivered by it to defendant Agricultural Productivity
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged that it had
presented on June 14, 1967 a claim for payment of the sum with the Auditor
General, but that since the latter had failed to decide the claim within two
(2) months from date of its presentation which should have been by August 13,
1967, it had acquired the right under Act No. 3083 to file the original action
for collection in the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants moved for the
dismissal of the case princi­pally on the ground of the lower court's lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter, alleging that under sections 2 and 3,
Article XI of the Philippine Constitution, creating the General Auditing Office
as a constitutional office and defining its functions, in re­lation to
Commonwealth Act No. 327 enacted in 1938 as an imple­menting law, and under
Rule 44 of the Revised Rules of Court, the settlement of money claims against
the Government of the Philippines has been placed under the exclusive original
jurisdiction of the Auditor General to the exclusion of courts of first
instance, while the Supreme Court is vested with appellate juris­diction over
the Auditor General's decisions involving claims of private persons or entities.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court sustained
defendants' dismissal motion and declared itself without jurisdiction to hear
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon plaintiff's filing of its
motion for reconsideration of December 9, 1967, defendants further brought out
the fact that on October 6, 1967,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the Auditor General had rendered his
decision deny­ing plaintiff's claim on the ground that the alleged purchase
order relied upon by plaintiff was null and void, since there was no ob­ligating
instrument as required by law,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> besides mentioning the grossly exorbitant
price of P795.00 for each fire extinguisher as compared to the Director of
Supply Coordination's approved purchases of the same fire extinguisher at the
price of P199.00 each.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The lower court having maintained its
dismissal order, plaintiff instituted the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole question of law that plaintiff submits on appeal is its
contention that under Act 3083 - which it claims to be still in force, not
having been amended, repealed or declared unconstitutional - it had the clear
right to institute its direct action in the lower court upon the
Auditor-General's failure to decide its claim within two months from the date
of its presentation, and that the lower court's jurisdiction which had thus
attached could no longer be displaced, notwithstanding the Aud­itor General's
subsequent adverse decision of October 6, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal order must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is patent that the governing law under which private par­ties
may sue and seek settlement by the Philippine Government of their money claims
pursuant to Article XI, section 3 of the Philippine Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
is Commonwealth Act No. 327.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1
of said Act, pursuant to the Constitutional injunction, fixes the period of
"sixty days exclusive of Sundays and holidays after their presentation"
within which the Auditor General shall act on and decide the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said section further provides that "If
said accounts or claims need reference to other persons, office or offices, or
to the party interested, the period shall be counted from the time the last
comment necessary to a proper decision is received by him."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under section 2 of said Act, furthermore, the
aggrieved private party may take an appeal, within thirty (30) days from
receipt of the Auditor General's adverse decision only to the Supreme Court, by
filing with the Court a petition for review thereof, as provided in Rule 44 of
the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding provisions of Act 3083 which are utterly
incompatible with those of Commonwealth Act must therefore be deemed superseded
and abrogated, under the principle of "<span class="SpellE"><u>leges</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">posteriores</span> <span class="SpellE">priores</span> <span class="SpellE">contrarias</span> <span class="SpellE">abrogant</span></u>" - a
later statute which is repugnant to an earlier statute is deemed to have
abrogated the earlier one on the same subject matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inaction by the Auditor General for the sixty-day period now
provided by Commonwealth Act 327 (exclusive of Sundays and holidays) and of
time consumed in referring the matter to other persons or officers) no longer
entitles the claimant to file a direct suit in court, as he was formerly
authorized under Act 3083 in the event of the Auditor General's failure to
decide within a flat period of two months.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the Constitution and Com­monwealth Act 327 expressly enjoin the
Auditor General to act on and decide the claim within the fixed 60-day period,
a claim­ant's remedy is to institute mandamus proceedings to compel <span style="">the rendition of a decision by the Auditor
General in the event of such inaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The courts of first instance no longer have the original
jurisdiction to act on such claims, which actions, under section 4 of Act 3083
now discarded, "shall be governed by the same rules of procedure, both
original and appellate, as if the liti­gants were private parties" - since
exclusive original jurisdic­tion under Article XI of the Constitution and the
implementing Act, Commonwealth Act 327 is vested in the Auditor General, and
appellate jurisdiction is vested in the President in cases of accountable
officers, and in the Supreme Court in cases of private persons and entities
upon proper and timely petitions for review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court has so
indicated in a number of cases that claim­ants have to prosecute their money
claims against the Government under Commonwealth Act 327, stating that Act 3083
stands now merely as the general law waiving the State's immunity from suit,
subject to the general limitation expressed in Section 7 thereof that "no
execution shall issue upon any judgment rendered by any Court against the
Government of the (Philippines),</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and that the conditions provided in
Commonwealth Act 327 for filing money claims against the Government must be
strictly observed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No error was committed, therefore, by the lower court in
dismissing the case and declaring itself without jurisdiction over the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs against <span style="">pla</span>intiff-­appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for by defendants-<span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span>, plaintiff-appellant is ordered to remove
