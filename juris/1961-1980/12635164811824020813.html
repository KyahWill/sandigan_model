to the Supreme Court on questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="3">March <span style="">6, </span>1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Mariquita</span> Luna and Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span>
entered into a contract of lease for a period of 10 <span style="">years </span>involving a parcel of
agricultural land containing an area of 158.7713 hectares situated at <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stipulated rent was P4,500 a year payable
semi-annually for the first five years and P5,000 yearly <span style="">beginning January</span> <span style="">1967, <span class="GramE">to</span> </span>the
end of the period of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lessee, <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span>, failed or refused to pay in full
the stipulated rent during the first two years of the contract such that as of
March 26, <span style="">1964, </span>he owed the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> <span style="">unpaid </span><span style="">rents in the amount
of P4,156.63.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="5">May 26, <span style="">1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the </span>plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
against the defendant-lessee for rescission, with damages, of the contract of
lease above referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">rescissory</span> action was grounded, principally, on the failure
or refusal of the lessee to pay in full the stipulated rent for about two
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the lower court
rendered its decision holding that plaintiff had made out a case for rescission
with damages, but that the court could not order the defendant to vacate the
leased premises because the land <span style="">is </span>situated at <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>,
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, where it had no jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, judgment was rendered in favor
of the plaintiff granting rescission of the contract of lease, with damages,
consisting of unpaid rents as well <span style="">as </span>future rents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court on
questions <span style="">of
</span>law and in due time filed her brief as appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No brief was filed for the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the lower court erred in finding that
since the leased land <span style="">is </span>situated at <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Mindoro</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
it had no jurisdiction to order the defendant, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
here, to vacate the leased premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention <span style="">is
</span>tenable in view of the following considerations:</p>

<blockquote>(1) A Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over suits involving
title to, or possession of, real estate wherever situated in the Philippines,
subject to the rules on venue of actions (Manila Railroad Company vs.
Attorney-General, etc., et al., 20 Phil. <span style="">523;
</span>Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
vs. De Leon, et al., <span style="">56 </span>Phil. <span style="">169; </span>Navarro vs. <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>,
et al., <span style="">66 </span>Phil. 604 Lim Cay et
al. vs. Del Rosario, etc., et al., <span style="">55 </span>Phil.
692);</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Rule <span style="">4, </span>Section 2, of the Rules of Court <span class="SpellE">requireing</span>
that an action involving real property shall be brought in the Court of First
Instance of the province where the land lies <span style="">is </span>a rule on venue of actions, which
may be waived expressly or by implication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, there was an implied waiver of improper venue of the
action because the defendant answered and went to trial without objecting to
the improper venue; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) Rescission of the contract of lease necessarily requires, as a
consequence thereof, the return of the thing leased to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the judgment granting rescission of
the contract of lease should also have ordered the lessee to vacate and return
the leased premises to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court having jurisdiction over the
case for rescission of the contract of lease and the restoration of possession
of the land leased to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, and the defendant
having impliedly waived the improper venue of the action, said court could
properly not only grant rescission of the contract of lease but also order the
defendant to vacate and return the leased premises to the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contract of lease
contained a stipulation "that the parties herein agreed that the Court of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> shall </span>have the exclusive jurisdiction to
any case that may arise in this contract. * * *".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This stipulation is void because the
jurisdiction of the courts is conferred by law and cannot be the subject-matter
of <span style="">con</span>tracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, <span style="">as </span>pointed out, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> had, in accordance with law, ju­risdiction over
the case, and there was implied waiver <span style="">of </span>improper venue by the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the lower court erred <span style="">in </span>not ordering payment of the
stipulated rent of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> yearly from <span style="">January, </span>1967, up to the time the
leased land is returned to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contention is technically untenable, for the reason that <span style="">rescission </span>and performance are
incompatible with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To order
payment of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> <span style="">as </span>annual rent beginning January,
1967, up to the time the land leased is returned to the plaintiff would amount
to performance and would be incompatible with rescission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action for <span style="">rescission </span>having been filed on May 26, 1964, the damages to which
the plaintiff-appellant is entitled are the unpaid rents from January 1, 1962,
up to the filing of the action for rescission on May 26, 1964, for the reason
that in an action by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> for rescission of the
lease under Article 1659 of the Civil Code, the Court has <span style="">no </span>discre­tion
to grant the lessee a longer period for performance but must decree the
rescission demanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span style="">the </span>yearly reasonable rental value of
the land which contains an area of 158.7713 hectares must be paid by the former
lessee as long as possession thereof is retained by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We fix the reasonable rental value at P4<span class="GramE">,500</span> per year from <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="5">May
 26, 1964</st1:date>, up to the time the land is vacated and returned to the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the lower
court, granting rescission of the contract of lease is affirmed with the following
modifications:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1. The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is ordered to vacate and return the leased
premises to the appellant; 2. The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is ordered
to pay the appellant the unpaid rents from January 1, 1962, to May 26, 1964, in
the sum of P4,156.63 with legal interest from the time of judicial demand until
fully paid and, there­after, the sum <span style="">of </span>P4,500 annually as reasonable rental
value of the land up to the time the land is vacated by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
and returned to the appellant.</p>
