				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This prohibition proceeding was instituted by petitioners to restrain respondent fiscals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; from conducting the preliminary investigation of a complaint accusing them of the crime of falsification of a public document.&nbsp; The contention is seriously pressed that there is a prejudicial question constituting a bar to such a proceeding, relying on a pending civil suit filed by them for breach of contract with damages against the complainant in the falsification charge, a certain Domingo R. Alvarez, the defendant in such civil action, who alleged that the document upon which the cause of action arose was a forgery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; That succinctly put is the essence of this petition for prohibition.&nbsp; What is clearly apparent is its lack of merit.&nbsp; As will be shown, the authoritative doctrines speak categorically and plainly that until after the filing of a case in court, a prejudicial question, even if impressed with merit, cannot be raised.&nbsp; What is sought to be obtained, therefore, in this petition is, to say the least, clearly premature.&nbsp; Nor does it change matters to allege that the complaint for falsification had been previously dismissed by a justice of the peace,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and thereafter filed anew with respondent Provincial Fiscal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Again, the authorities are much too clear; they do not lend support to the pretension of petitioners.&nbsp; We have to dismiss the petition.&nbsp; <p> Now for the controlling decisions.&nbsp; </p><p> 1. The answer to the petition praying for its dismissal relied primarily on Dasalla v. City Attorney of Quezon City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; a 1962 decision.&nbsp; As was explicitly made clear in the opinion of Justice Padilla:&nbsp; "Granting that the prejudicial question raised by the appellants be legally correct, still the time or moment to ask for the suspension of the criminal proceedings is not during the period of preliminary investigation by the city prosecuting officer but after such investigation and after he shall have filed the informations against the appellants."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Then came <em>Estrella v. Orendain, Jr</em>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> with Justice Barredo as <em>ponente</em>.&nbsp; It appears from the facts that the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal refused to act on the complaint precisely because there was the alleged obstacle of an existing prejudicial question.&nbsp; That was an insufficient basis for the failure to fulfill his duty.&nbsp; So it was pointed out in the opinion:&nbsp; "Contrary to the contention of the petitioner, the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal refused to act.&nbsp; He refused to conduct any investigation of petitioner of the charge against him, alleging a supposed legal impediment which, at best, was erronoeous.&nbsp; He claimed that a prejudicial question existed, but it is settled that the matter of prejudicial questions cannot be resolved by fiscals but by the court after the corresponding information has already been filed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Petitioners relied on the earlier case of <em>De Leon v. Mabanag</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; a 1940 decision.&nbsp; It would clearly appear then, the petition having been filed in November of 1968, that they ignored the later decision of Dasalla. What cannot be denied is that Mabanag has now been overruled.&nbsp; So it could easily be inferred from Estrella where there was a reiteration of Dasalla and impliedly a rejection of Mabanag concerning the time and the forum as to when and where a prejudicial question may be raised.&nbsp; Whatever doubt on the matter may exist is removed by <em>Isip v. Gonzales</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; also a 1971 decision, this Court speaking anew through Justice Barredo.&nbsp; Thus:&nbsp; "More definitely in Estrella v. Orendain, Jr. and Quilop, G.R. No. L-19611, February 27, 1971, We held that ‘it is settled that the matter of prejudicial questions cannot be resolved (until) * * * after the corresponding information has already been filed.' Of course, this is not to overlook the holding in the earlier case of <em>De Leon v. Mabanag</em>, heavily relied upon by petitioners, which sustained an action for prohibition against the City Fiscal of Manila to stop him from proceeding with the preliminary investigation of a charge of falsification of public documents on the ground of the existence of a prejudicial question in a civil case; but Dasalla being much later in point of time, and since, on the other hand, it already formed part of our jurisprudence when the revised Rules of Court were promulgated in 1964, it is obvious that Section 5 of Rule 111 of said Rules should be construed consistently with the ruling in Dasalla."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The latest word on the subject is <em>Falgui, Jr. v. Provincial Fiscal of Batangas</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; a 1975 decision, the opinion of Justice Antonio quoting the above excerpt from Isip.&nbsp; Mention was likewise made that such a doctrine was followed in <em>Bautista v. Navarro</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and <em>Rojas v. People</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> 2. Nor is a different conclusion warranted by the stress on the petition that the complaint for falsification against petitioners was dismissed by the Municipal Court of Surigao, Surigao del Norte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; That is no obstacle to the provincial fiscal conducting his own preliminary investigation.&nbsp; So this Court explicitly affirmed in <em>People v. Pervez</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> a 1960 decision.&nbsp; If a municipal court now, a justice of the peace previously, in the language of the <em>ponente</em>, Justice J.B.L. Reyes, "dismisses the charge, then the case stands as if no charge had been made, and the Provincial Fiscal may thereafter conduct his own investigation of the same charge * * *, making it in the presence of the accused if and when the latter so requests."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Thereafter, the same jurist made use of the very same words in disposing of a similar issue raised in <em>People v. Reginaldo</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and <em>Abubakar v. Arca</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> So did Justice Padilla in <em>People v. Mapa and Abalo</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and Chief Justice Concepcion in <em>People v. Tan</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p>3. That is about all, except for the pointed reference in the petition to respondent First Assistant Provincial Fiscal Lozada being assigned to conduct the preliminary investigation of the complaint for falsification against petitioners, an anomaly in their opinion consider­ing that it was he who appeared "for the prosecution when [the] case against petitioners [thereafter dismissed] was still pending in the Municipal Court of Surigao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Their concern is understandable.&nbsp; Doubts can honestly be entertained about the impartiality of respondent Lozada.&nbsp; He had as prosecutor made up his mind about the complaint against petitioners.&nbsp; Then he would be called upon to exercise his quasi-judicial power.&nbsp; What is said of judges equally applies then to a fiscal conducting a preliminary investigation.&nbsp; The well-settled doctrine followed by this Court and given expression is that any one entrusted with such an awesome responsibility must act in such a way that no bias or prejudice could justly be imputed to him.&nbsp; As recently set forth in <em>Castillo v. Juan</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; “In every litigation, perhaps much more so in criminal cases, the manner and attitude of a trial judge are crucial to everyone concerned, the offended party, no less than the accused.&nbsp; It is not for him to indulge or even to give the appearance of catering to the at-times human failing of yielding to first impressions.&nbsp; He is to refrain from reaching hasty conclusions or prejudging matters.&nbsp; It would be deplorable if he lays himself open to the suspicion of reacting to feelings rather than to facts, of being imprisoned in the net of his own sympathies and predilections."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Such a principle goes back to the leading case of <em>Gutierrez v. Santos</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> rightfully stressing "that every litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; It is imperative, therefore, that the hearing of the preliminary investigation be assigned to any fiscal other than respondent First Assistant Provincial Fiscal Lozada, on the assumption that he is still holding that position. &nbsp; <p><strong> WHEREFORE</strong> , the petition for prohibition is dismissed.&nbsp; The restraining order issued by this Court on December 11, 1968 is hereby lifted, set aside, and declared of no further force or effect.&nbsp; No costs.&nbsp; </p><p><em> Barredo, Antonio, Aquino, </em> and<em> Concepcion, Jr., JJ., </em>concur.&nbsp; </p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The respondents are the Provincial Fiscal of Surigao del Norte and the First Assistant Provincial Fiscal, Carlo H.
