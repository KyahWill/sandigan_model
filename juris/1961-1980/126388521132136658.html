Besides, although the name of Felipe Samson appears in the sales memorandum showing the down payment and other details of Lot 53, Pcs-3526, with an area of 175.8 sq. meters, the same is not signed, which shows that it has never been approved. And again, according to the testimony of Atty. Besa, the prospective awardees of government lots are first being processed in accordance with the provision of Act 539, and Land Administrative Order No. R-3-1, to determine their being landless, and as per above provision, the petitioners have not acquired any right as yet in Lot 53, Pcs-3526 above-mentioned, specially on this disputed portion of 63.6 sq. meters, so that they have no material and legal interest in the land in question and, therefore, have no basis to bring the instant suit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; </p> </blockquote> <p>It is clear that the area of 36.8 square meters sought by the plaintiff-appellant to be deducted from Lot 2, Block 12, Pcs-5580 to be integrated or included in Lot 53-B, Block 12, Pcs-3526 is included in the former Lot 13, Block 12, Plan Pcs 2555 awarded to Feliciana Ramos and that Lot 2, Block 12, Pcs-5580 is the same as Lot 13, Block 12, Pcs-2555. </p><p>The lower court, therefore, correctly dismissed the present action on the ground of <em>res judicata</em>. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the order appealed from dismissing the complaint in Civil Case No. 64400 of the Court of First Instance of Manila is hereby affirmed, with costs against the plaintiff. </p><p><strong>SO ORDERED. </strong> </p><p> </p><p><em>Castro, C.J., Teehankee, (Chairman), Makasiar</em>, and <em>Guerrero, JJ.</em>, concur. </p><p><em>Muñoz Palma, J.</em>, did not take part. </p><p> </p><p>________________________________________ </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Record on Appeal, pp. 66-68, Rollo, p. 8. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, pp. 25-28.
