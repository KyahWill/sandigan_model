<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1923" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1923</st1:date>,
petitioner was employed as a classroom teacher by the respondent Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
thru the Bureau of Public Schools (hereinafter referred to as respondent
Republic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of her
employment, she was found to be suffering from hypertension, hypertensive heart
disease and tuberculosis of the lungs with <span class="SpellE">hymoptysis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to her ailments, she was constrained to retire
from her position on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1966</st1:date>
under Republic Act 660 at the age of 63 after having rendered more than forty
(40) years of government service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in September 1972, petitioner filed a formal notice of
injury and claim for compensation which was tentatively <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by the respondent Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
during the hearing before the Acting Labor Referee, the respondent Republic
failed to present any evidence in <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of
petitioner's claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1974</st1:date>,

PESOS, as administrative fee."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon review of the records of the case,
the respondent Commission reversed the decision of the Acting Labor Referee and
dismissed the claim of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing petitioner's claim for compensation, the respondent
Commission ruled that she was not disabled from labor prior to her retirement
because she was merely suffering from hypertension and that her retirement was
by reason of age and length of service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This conclusion of the respondent Commission finds no support in the
evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
Commission failed to consider the testimony of petitioner and that of her
attending physician who submitted the Report of Sickness or Accident.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It is clearly indicated in the Report of the Local Claims Committee for
Compensation<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
composed of the School Physician, the District Supervisor and the School
Principal:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the claimant started as a classroom
teacher on <st1:date year="1923" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1923</st1:date>
until <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1966</st1:date> when
she retired under Republic Act 660, serving the respondent for more than 40
years; she retired at the age of 63 with the last salary rate of P3<span class="GramE">,223.56</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
the claimant began to feel the pain and suffered hypertension in 1954 and she
had to consult some physician with different hospital, like the <st1:place><st1:placename>Graham</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
in 1964, she was treated by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Simeona</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Virtucio</span>,
who prepared the physician's report.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
the findings of the physician pointed to the fact that the claimant has been
suffering from a hypertensive heart disease which was caused by her employment
as a teacher in view of the <span class="SpellE">routinary</span> activities,
such as taking direct supervision and control of the school children;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
physician also revealed that the claimant's work involved emotional tension on
account of her teaching activities which caused her to contract tubercular
lungs with <span class="SpellE">hymoptysis</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
her constant hiking from her place of residence to her station practically
exposed her to the bad elements of weather and dust, resulting in the
aggravation of her ailment and resulting to her present rheumatic condition,
and for which reason, he was advised to rest by her physician, hence her
retirement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This Report contrary to the conclusion of
the respondent Commission clearly shows that petitioner was physically
incapable of performing her usual work and disabled for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, her retirement from her position on
August 31, 1966 under Republic Act No. 660 at the age of 63 after having
rendered more than forty (40) years of government service would not have been
approved if she had not complied with conditions prescribed for optional
retirement, pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 133 issued by the Office of the
President which among others provides that "all applications for optional
retirement under Com. Act No. 180, as amended by Rep. Act No. 1616 and No. 4968
shall not be recommended for approval unless funds are available in the bureau
or office concerned for the payment of applicants retirement gratuity over and
above the fund requirements of its programmed projects and activities and
provided any of the following circumstances or conditions, is present:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. <span class="GramE">The</span> employee-applicant is below 65 years of age, is
physically incapacitated to render further efficient service".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The fact that petitioner's application
for optional retirement at the age of 63 was duly <span class="GramE">approved,</span>
simply indicates that she has met the conditions or requirements for retirement
that she was below 65 years of age but she was physically incapacitated to
render further efficient service.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, while the respondent Republic made a tentative
<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of petitioner's claim, nevertheless, it
failed to present any evidence to the contrary during the hearing conducted by
the Acting Referee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this amounts
to no <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is well settled that once the
illness has supervened during the time of employment, there exists a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that the same arose out of or was at least aggravated by such employment and
the burden to overthrow said presumption shifts to the employer and the
employee is relieved of the burden to show causation.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the failure to controvert the claim is fatal to any defense that the
employer could interpose and that constructively, such failure is equivalent to
an admission that the claim is compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the circumstances, the inescapable conclusion is that the petitioner had
contracted her ailments, namely, hypertension, hypertensive heart disease and
tuberculosis of the lungs in the course of her employment and that the same
were aggravated by the nature of her work as a classroom teacher which involved
emotional strain because she had to take direct control and supervision over
school children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, petitioner
had been subjected to constant exposure to the elements for such a considerable
length of time as she had to walk from her residence to her official
station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her physical condition must
have deteriorated to such a state that she could no longer discharge the task
of a classroom teacher, forcing her to retire from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, peti­tioner is entitled to
compensation under Sections 2 and 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FORE­GOING, the decision of
