First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch IV, declaring 
the <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos, entitled to the possession of the car in 
dispute.
<p>The records before this Court disclose that sometime in May, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos advertised in two metropolitan papers the 
sale of his FORD FAIRLANE 500. In the afternoon of <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1959">May 28, 1959</st1:date>, a certain L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>, claiming to be a nephew of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>, went to the 
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> residence to answer the ad. 
However, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos was out during this call and 
only the latter's son, <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos received and 
talked with De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>. The latter told the young 
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> that he had come in behalf Â°f 
his uncle, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>, who was interested to buy 
he advertised car.</p>
<p>On being informed of the above, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos 
instructed his son to see the said Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> 
.the following day at his given address: <st1:street><st1:address>1642 <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>. And so, in the morning of 
<st1:date month="5" day="29" year="1959">May 29, 1959</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos went to the above address. At this meeting, 
<span class="SpellE">Marella</span> agreed to buy the car for P14<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> on the understanding that the price would be paid 
only after the car had been registered in his name.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos then fetched his father who, together 
with L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>, went to the office of a certain Atty. 
Jose <span class="SpellE">Padolina</span> where the deed of sale for the car was 
executed in <span class="SpellE">Marella's</span> favor. The parties to the 
contract thereafter proceeded to the Motor Vehicles' Office in 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> 
City</st1:place></st1:city> where the registration of the car in <span class="SpellE">Marella's</span> name was. <span class="GramE">effected</span>. Up to 
this stage of the transaction, the purchase price had not been paid.<br>From the 
Motor Vehicles Office, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos returned to his 
house. He gave the registration papers and a copy of the deed of sale to his 
son, <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span>, and instructed him not to part with them 
until <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> shall have given the full payment for 
the car. <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos and L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> then proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address>1642 <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> in 
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> where the former demanded for 
the payment from Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>. <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> said that the amount he had on hand then was short 
by some P2,000.00 and begged off to be allowed to secure the shortage from a 
sister supposedly living somewhere in <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span> Street 
also in Manila. Thereafter, he ordered L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> to 
go to the said sister and suggested that <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos 
to go with him. At the same time, he requested for the registration papers and 
the deed of sale from <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> Santos on the pretext 
that he would like to show them to h lawyers. Trusting the good faith of <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>, Irene" handed over the same to the latter and 
thereupon, in the company of L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> and another 
unidentified person proceeded to the alleged house of <span class="SpellE">Marella's</span> sister.</p>
<p>At a place in <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span>, <span class="SpellE">lrineo</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> 
and L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> alighted from the car and entered a 
house, while their unidentified companion remained in the car. Once inside, L. 
De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> asked <span class="SpellE">lrineo</span> 
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> to wait at the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> while he went inside a room. That was the last that 
<span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> saw of him. For, after a considerable length of 
time waiting in vain for De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> to return, <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> went down to discover that neither the car nor their 
unidentified companion was there anymore. Going back to the house, he inquired 
from a woman he saw for L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> and he was told 
that no such name lived or was even known therein. <span class="GramE">Whereupon, 
<span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> Santos rushed to 1642 <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> to see <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>.</span> 
He found the house closed and <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> gone. Finally, 
he reported the matter to his father who promptly advised the police <span class="GramE">authorities</span>.</p>
<p>That very .same day, on the afternoon of <st1:date month="5" day="29" year="1959">May 29, 1959</st1:date>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> 
was able to sell the car in question to the plaintiff-appellant herein, Jose B. 
<span class="SpellE">Aznar</span>, for P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. 
Insofar as the above incidents are concerned, we are bound by the factual 
finding of the trial court that Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> acquired 
the said car from Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> in good faith, for a 
valuable consideration and without notice of the defect appertaining to the 
vendor's title.</p>
<p>While the car in question was thus in the possession of Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> and while he was attending to its registration in his 
name, agents of the Philippine Constabulary seized and confiscated the same in 
consequence of the report to them by <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos 
that the said car unlawfully taken from him.</p>
<p>In due time, Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> filed a complaint for 
<span class="SpellE">replevin</span> against Captain Rafael <span class="SpellE">Yapdiangco</span>, the head of the Philippine Constabulary unit 
which seized the car in Question. Claiming ownership of the vehicle, he prayed 
for its delivery to him. In the course of the litigation, however, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos moved and was allowed to intervene by the 
lower court.</p>
<p>At the end of the trial, the lower court rendered a decision awarding the 
disputed motor vehicle to the <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos. In brief, it ruled that <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos had been unlawfully deprived of his personal 
property by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>, from whom the 
plaintiff-appellant traces his right. Consequently, although the 
plaintiff-appellant acquired the car in good faith and for a valuable 
consideration from Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>, the said decision 
concluded, still the in <span class="SpellE">tervenor-appellee</span> was entitled 
to its recovery on the mandate of Article 559 of the New Civil Code which 
provides:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Art. 559. The possession of movable property acquired in good faith is 
equivalent to title. Nevertheless, one who has lost any movable or has been 
unlawfully deprived thereof, may recover it from the person in possession of the 
same.</p>
<p>"If the possessor of a movable lost or of which the owner has been unlawfully 
deprived, has acquired it in good faith at a public sale, the owner cannot 
obtain its return without reimbursing the price paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."</p></blockquote>
<p>From this decision, Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> appeals.</p>
<p>The issue at bar is one and simple, to wit: Between <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos and the plaintiff-appellant, Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span>, who has a better right to the <span class="SpellE">posession</span> of the disputed automobile?</p>
<p>We find for the <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos.</p>
<p>The plaintiff-appellant accepts that the car in question originally belonged 
to and was owned by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos, and that the latter was unlawfully deprived 
of the same by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>. However, the appellant 
contends that upon the facts of this case, the applicable provision of the Civil 
Code is Artie'6 1506 and not Article 559 as was held by the decision under 
review. Article 1506 provides:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Art. 1506. Where the seller of goods has a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> title thereto but his title has not been voided at 
the time of the sale, the buyer acquires a good title to the goods, provided he 
buys them in good faith, for value, and without notice of the seller's defect of 
titleâ</p></blockquote>
<p>The contention is clearly unmeritorious. Under the <span class="SpellE">aforequofed</span> provision, it is essential that the seller 
should have a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> title at least it is very 
clearly inapplicable where, as in this case, the seller had no title at all.</p>
<p>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> did not have any title to the 
property under litigation because the same was never delivered to him. He sought 
ownership or acquisition of it by virtue of the contract Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> could have acquired ownership or title to the 
subject matter only by the delivery or tradition of the car to him.</p>
<p>Under Article 712 of the Civil Code, "ownership and other real rights over 
property are acquired and transmitted by law, by donation, by testate and 
intestate succession, and in consequence of certain contracts, by tradition." As 
interpreted by this Court in a host of cases, by this provision, ownership is 
not transferred by contract merely but by tradition or delivery. Contracts only 
constitute titles or rights to the transfer or acquisition of ownership, while 
delivery or tradition is the mode of accomplishing the same. (Gonzales vs. 
Rojas, 16 Phil. 51; <span class="SpellE">Ocejo</span>, Perez and Co. vs. 
International Bank, 37 Phil. 631; Fidelity and Deposit Co. vs. Wilson, 8 Phil. 
51; <span class="SpellE">Kuenzle</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Streiff</span> 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Wacke</span> &amp; Chandler, 14 Phil. 610; Easton vs. 
Diaz &amp; Co., 32 Phil. 180)</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"For the legal acquisition and transfer of ownership and other property 
rights, the thing transferred must be delivered, inasmuch as, according to 
settled Jurisprudence the tradition of the thing is a necessary and 
indispensable requisite in the acquisition of said ownership by virtue of a 
contract. (Waller Easton vs. E. Diaz &amp; Co. &amp; the Provincial Sheriff of 
<span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, supra.)</p>
<p>"So long as property is not delivered, the ownership over it is not 
transferred by contract -merely but by delivery. Contracts only constitute 
titles or lights to the transfer or acquisition of ownership, while delivery or 
tradition is the method of accomplishing the same, the title and the method of 
acquiring it being different in our law." (Gonzales vs. Rojas, 16 Phil. 
51)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case on hand, the car in question was never delivered to the vendee by 
the vendor as to complete or consummate the transfer of ownership by virtue of 
the contract. It should be recalled that while there was indeed a contract of 
sale between Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santos, the former, as vendee, took possession of 
the subject matter thereof by stealing the same while it was in the custody of 
the latter's son.</p>
<p>There is no adequate evidence on record as to whether <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos voluntarily delivered the key to the car to 
the unidentified person who went with him and L. De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> to the place in <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span> 
where a sister of <span class="SpellE">Marella</span> allegedly lived- But even if 
<span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos did, it was not the delivery 
contemplated by Article 712 of the Civil Code. For then, it would be 
indisputable that he turned it over to the unidentified companion only so that 
he may drive <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Santos and De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> to the said place in <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span> and not vest the title to the said vehicle to him 
as agent of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>. Article 712 above 
contemplates that the act be coupled with the intent of delivering the thing. 
(10 <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city> 132)</p>
<p>The lower court was correct in applying Article 559 of the Civil Code to the 
case at bar. For under it, the rule is to the effect that if the owner has lost 
the thing, or if he has been unlawfully deprived of it, he has a right to 
recover it, not only from the finder, thief or robber, but also from the third 
person who may have acquired it in good faith from such finder, thief or robber. 
The said article establishes two exceptions to the general rule of <span class="SpellE">irrevindicability</span> to wit: when the owner (1) has lost the 
thing, or (2) has been unlawfully deprived thereof. In these cases, the 
possessor cannot retain the thing as against the owner, who may recover it 
without paying any indemnity, except when the possessor acquired it in a public 
sale. <span class="GramE">(Del Rosario v. <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, 8 
Phil. 535; Varela v. <span class="SpellE">Finnick</span>, 9 Phil. 482; Varela v. 
<span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, 9 Phil. 479; Arenas v. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, 19 Phil. 46.</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span><u>, id</u>., <span class="SpellE">Vol</span> 
II, p. 261,</p>
<p>In the case of Cruz vs. <span class="SpellE">Pahati</span>, et al., 98 Phil., 
788; 52 O.G. 3053, this Court has already ruled thatâ</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Under Article 559 of the new Civil Code, a person illegally deprived of any 
movable may recover it from the person in possession of the same and the only 
defense the latter may have is if he has acquired it in good faith at a public 
sale, in which case, the owner cannot obtain its return without reimbursing the 
price paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>. In the present case, plaintiff 
has been illegally deprived of his car through the ingenious scheme of defendant 
B to enable the latter to dispose of it as if he were the owner thereof. 
Plaintiff, therefore, can still recover possession-of the car even if it is in 
the possession of a third party who had acquired it in good faith from defendant 
B. The maxim that "no man can transfer to another a better title than he has 
himself obtains in the civil as well as in the common law." 
(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sootelo</span>, 28 Phil. 147).</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, the plaintiff-appellant here contends that inasmuch as it was the 
<span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span> who had caused the fraud to be 
perpetrated by his misplaced confidence on Vicente <span class="SpellE">Marella</span>, he, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor-appellee</span>, should be made to suffer the 
consequences arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, following the 
equitable principle to that effect. Suffice it to say in this regard that the 
right of the owner to recover personal property acquired in good faith by <span class="GramE">another,</span> is based on his being dispossessed without his 
consent. The common law principle that where one of two innocent persons must 
suffer by a fraud perpetrated by Another, the law imposes the loss upon the 
party who, by his misplaced confidence, has enabled the fraud to be committed, 
cannot be applied in a case which is covered by an express provision of the new 
Civil Code, specifically Article 559. Between a common law principle and a 
statutory provision, the latter must prevail in this jurisdiction. (Cruz vs. 
<span class="SpellE">Paihati</span>, <u>supra</u>)</p>
