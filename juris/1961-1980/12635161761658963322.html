<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that

situated in the barrio of San <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Guagua</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, which, </span><span style="">since October 1962, was under cultivation by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Ananias</span> David, as petitioners'
tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in </span><span style="">1963, </span><span style="">David sold his "right to </span><span style="">work" </span><span style="">on the land,
to respondent <span class="SpellE">Rosallo</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Mercado, who, thereupon, planted

1, 1963, David Mercado <span style="">and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eunaria</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span></span></span><span style=""> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Guilas</span> - </span><span style="">evidently
</span><span style="">act</span><span style="">ing for the benefit of herself and her
co-owners - exe­cuted an "agreement," in the <span class="SpellE">Pampango</span>
dialect, Annex </span><span style="">A, </span><span style="">which, translated into English, stipulated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.-</span> THAT I, ANANIAS DAVID is the
former tenant in share of the landholding of EUNARIA B. VDA. <span style="">DE </span>GUILAS, situated in the barrio of
San <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Guagua</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, but I do admit to <span style="">have sold my rights as such tenant in favor of ROSALIO MERCADO without
any permission nor </span><span style="">consent of
the landholders and for that reason the latter or </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rosalio</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Mercado </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">the one who planted the said parcel of land, which will be harvested
this coming month of January </span><span style="">1964,
</span><span style="">more or </span><span style="">less;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"2<span class="GramE">.-</span>
</span>THAT in order that this matter will not be brought farther to the proper
authori­ties or court, <span style="">we </span>the
undersigned agreed to the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">a) THAT I, ROSALIO MERCADO will <span style="">harvest only </span>the present crop and after harvesting <span style="">it in January 1964, </span>I will deliver and
return to the landholder EUNARIA B. VDA. DE GUILAS the aforesaid landholdings
with full authority and <span style="">right to </span><span style="">have it </span><span style="">tenanted or leased to others; provided, however, that their
corresponding share on the crop to be harvested shall be delivered to them
after deducting the deductible expenses from </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">gross harvest;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">b) THAT I, ANANIAS DAVID do admit my fault and for that reason I do
voluntary surrender my aforesaid work on this landholdings and do give full
authority and right to the owners thereof to find <span style="">a </span>new tenant in my place; provided furthers, that the <span style="">consideration I </span>received from ROSALIO
MERCADO in the sale of my rights to him, I bind to return the same <span style="">to </span><span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span>
Mercado without the owners <span style="">having
anything to do on this matter; </span>likewise, I, ROSALIO MERCADO do hereby
accept this request of <span class="SpellE">Ananias</span> David with respect to
the return of the amount I paid to him;</p>

<blockquote>"3<span class="GramE">.–</span> THAT I, EUNARIA B. VDA. DE
GUILAS do hereby accept all that appears in this agreement and for that reason
I will desists <span style="">in </span>bringing the
matter to the court as herein stated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, or on March
11, 1964, petitioners instituted the </span><span style="">present CAR Case No. 17-P-'64, against </span><span style="">David and Mercado for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> </span><span style="">with injunction, in </span><span style="">view of Mercado's failure to surrender the
land after harvesting the crop in January 1964, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">violation of the
aforementioned agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David did not
care to contest the complaint and was declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mercado, however, filed an answer, dated May </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1964, admit</span><span style="">ting some
allegations of the complaint, denying other </span><span style="">allegations thereof and alleging, by way of special and affirmative
defenses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) that, before beginning to
work on the land in question, he informed one Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Guilas</span>
about it; 2) that Annex A does not reflect the true intent of the parties
thereto; and </span>3) <span style="">that "an
agreement on future surrender is not enforceable in law."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Called for </span>pre-trial,
on September 29, 1964, counsel <span style="">for
petitioner and that of Mercado agreed on a partial stipulation of facts,
without prejudice to introducing evidence at the hearing of the case on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 27 1964, -
seemingly, after the presentation of petitioners' evidence - Mercado filed a
motion to dismiss - with reservation of the "right to x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> adduce evidence in support of
his defense," should the motion be denied - for the reason that "the
alleged agreement to surrender the landholding in the future (January, 1964) is
not one of the grounds for ejecting </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">tenant." Despite
petitioners' objection to the motion, the Court of Agrarian Relations granted
it and dismissed the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
petitions for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The order <span style="">sought to be
reviewed is based upon Section 50 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended </span>(on
<span style="">which Section </span><span style="">36 </span><span style="">of Republic Act No. </span>3844 <span style="">is
based), pursuant to which </span>a <span style="">tenant
may not be dispossessed of his landholdings, except upon one of the following
grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(a) <span class="GramE">The</span> <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
intention of the land?holder-owner or his relative within the first
degree by consanguinity to cultivate the land himself personally or through the
employment of farm machinery and implements:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) When the tenant violates or fails to comply with any of
the terms and conditions of the contract or any of the provisions of this
Act:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) <span class="GramE">The</span> tenant's failure to pay the
agreed rental or to deliver the landholders share:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(d) When the tenant uses the land for a
purpose ot<span style="">h</span>er than that
specified by agreement of the parties.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e) When a share-tenant fails to follow <span style="">those </span>proven farm practices which, as
determined by the Court of Agrarian Relations will contribute towards the
proper care of the land and increased agricultural production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(f) When the tenant through negligence
permits serious injury to the land which will impair its productive capacity.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(g) Conviction by competent court of a
tenant or <span style="">any </span>member of his
immediate family <span style="">or farm household of a
crime against the landholder or a member of his immediate family."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Obviously, this provision
would not be applicable to the case at bar if Mercado were not petitioners' <u>tenant</u>
at the time relevant to the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, the lower court found:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) that the sale made by David, of his right
to work on the land in question, as tenant of the petitioners, in favor of </span><span style="">Mercado, did <u>not</u> bind </span><span style="">the petitioners, said conveyance having been </span><span style="">made </span><span style="">without their knowledge and consent, and b) that, accordingly, the
relationship of landowner and tenant was <u>not</u> thereby established between
the petitioners and Mercado.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Court
held, however, that the </span><span style="">relationship
came into being in consequence </span><span style="">of
the agreement, Annex A, because petitioners had thereby consented to the
continuation of Mercado's possession up to January 1964</span><span style="">. </span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>This conclusion, drawn from
Annex </span><span style="">A, is untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Said agreement was
executed precisely because the </span><span style="">petitioners
were <u>unwilling</u> to take Mercado as <span class="GramE">tenant,</span> and
because the former </span><span style="">were legally
entitled </span><span style="">to sue the latter for
usurpation of possession and to have him, accordingly, ejected, since his
contract with David was not binding upon them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In consideration of petitioners' desistance from "bringing the
matter to the court," Mercado agreed to "harvest only the present
crop and after harvesting it in January 1964, </span><span style="">I will </span><span style="">deliver and
return to the landowner </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">the aforesaid landholdings." Mercado
entered into this agreement, not because petitioners had acquiesced to his
possession, but, precisely, because they <u>insisted</u> and <u>persisted</u>
in their <u>opposition</u> thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Annex </span><span style="">A was simply a <u>compromise
</u></span><u><span style="">agreement,</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">whereby,
<u>without giving up their aforementioned opposit</u></span><u><span style="">ion</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">petitioners refrained
from suing Mercado, owing to his promise to vacate </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">land in </span><span style="">January, 1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to </span><span style="">Article 2037 </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">our Civil Code, said
"compromise has upon </span><span style="">the
parties the effect and authority of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">adjudicata</span></u></span><span style="">," even if not judicially approved.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Upon its non-compliance by Mercado,
petitioners are </span><span style="">explicitly </span><span style="">authorized by </span><span style="">Article </span><span style="">2041 of </span><span style="">the same Code</span><span style=""> to "either enforce the compromise </span><span style="">or regard it </span><span style="">as re</span><span style="">scinded."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
order appealed from should be, as it is hereby, reversed, and the case remanded
to the lower court for further proceedings, with the costs of this </span><span style="">instance </span><span style="">against respondent <span class="SpellE">Rosallo</span></span><span style=""> Mercado</span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
