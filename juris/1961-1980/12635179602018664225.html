				G.R. No. L-28860, July 24, 1970</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ALFREDO T. LUY TO BE
ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, ALFREDO T. LUY, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Solicitor General seeks the reversal of a decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental,
granting the application for naturalization, as citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Alfredo Tan <span class="SpellE">Luy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main question for determination in this appeal is whether or
not the lower court has erred in rendering the decision ap­pealed from,
considering the fact that, admittedly, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had
not filed the declaration of intention required in Section 5 of Commonwealth
Act No. 473, commonly known as the Revised Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> maintains,
and the lower court held, that he is exempt from said requirement, he having,
allegedly, been born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and completed his primary, elementary and secondary education at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that to impart the benefits of said
exemption, petitioner's primary and secondary education - in addition to birth
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
- must have been received "in public schools or those <u>recognized</u> by
the Government and <u>not limited to any race or nationality</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The record shows that the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City Chinese High
School was <u>not</u> granted Government recognition until <u>1958</u>, whereas
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> finished high school therein in 1959, so that
the institution had <u>not</u>, as yet been re­cognized by the Government when
he completed his primary and elementary education, as well as when he finished
second year high school in 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, it has not been properly established that said
institution is "not limited to any race or nationality." We must bear
in mind that this characteristic "cannot be presumed from the fact that
the school is recognized by the Government,"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
but must be adequately made out by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, who
has the burden of proof in relation thereto, as one of the basic premises of
the exemption invoked by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
necessity of "clear and convincing" evidence thereon<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is underscored by the adverse implica­tions arising from the term "<u>Chinese</u>"
appearing in the name of said school, and from the fact that it is maintained
by the <u>Chinese</u> Educational Society of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>,
and that its principal teacher is a <u>Chinese</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter's certification to the effect that
the "school is not limited to any nationality, race or creed,"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
is not a statement of fact, but a mere conclusion, which is incumbent upon the
Court to draw.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, We are not satisfied that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
alleged birth in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has been duly proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, his
testimony to such effect is insufficient <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
So are his certificate of residence, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. V - dated
October 30, 1954, or over 17 years after his alleged birth on August 8, 1937 -
issued by the Bureau of Immigration, and his baptismal certificate - issued on
March 19, 1961 - since the former merely establishes his right to reside in the
Philippines, whereas the latter attests to his baptism at the place and on the
date stated therein - May 15, 1940 - several years after his birth, and neither
is the proper evidence of the date and place of such birth.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span></span></a> Again, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has not given a reasonable explanation for the non-production of his birth
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony to the effect
that the latter had been "misplaced or lost" by the Local Civil
Registrar is, to be sure, far from satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, it bears the earmarks of being
fanciful, inasmuch as the record of births is contained, not in individual
loose leaves, but in well bound, thick and ponderous record books, which cannot
just be "misplaced or lost."</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, it is conceded that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has not obtained, from the Minister of the Interior of Nationalist China, of
which he is a citizen, or even applied <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> for
the permission, required by laws of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in order that he could validly renounce his allegiance thereto and acquire
another citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as no
alien may, in general, be naturalized as citizen of the Philippines without
divesting himself of the nationality he has at the time of his naturalization,
by renouncing such nationality, it is clear that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
petition cannot be granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[2]</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed,
and another one shall be entered denying the petition for naturalization of
Alfredo T. <span class="SpellE">Luy</span> and dismissing this case, with costs
against him.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
