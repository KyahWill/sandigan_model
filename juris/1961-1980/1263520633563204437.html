				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc.
and the People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation
from the order dated <span style="">September 9, 1965
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ri­zal</span>, Branch </span>X,
issued in LRC Rec. No. 7581, <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bo­laños</span>, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., petitioners,
versus J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., et al.,
respondents, reading in full as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In their urgent petition dated March 17, 1965, the petitioner
prayed <span style="">that an order be published at
the </span>expense of the petitioners and ad­dressed to all to whom it may con­cern
enjoining all and sundry 'pending the promulgation of the decision of the
Supreme Court on any appeal which may be taken from the decision of this
Honorable Court dated January 12, 1965' to desist from disturbing the physical
possession of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>
of the parcel of land ob­ject of this case comprising 13,2619 hectares and
included in the area covered by said TCT Nos. 37677 and 37686 of the Registry
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that in a case filed before the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
Branch, enti­tled 'J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> <span style="">Co., </span>Inc., re­presented by its
managing partner, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc. versus <span class="SpellE">Qui­rino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>', the plaintiffs
sought to recover possession of the parcel of land object of the present action
from the defendant therein, and who is now one of the petitioners; that
decision having been rendered in favor of the plaintiff in said case and
against the defendant <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>
appealed the case to the Supreme Court (Exhibits 'B', 'B-1', to 'B-7') which
rendered a decision (No. L-4935, <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="5">May
 28, 1954</st1:date>), affirming the decision of the lower court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Civil Cases Nos. 3621, 3622, and 3623 of this Court,
Branch II, a decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1965</st1:date>, declaring Original Certificate of Title No. 735 of the
Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> as null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners made this decision as the
basis of their action, alleging that the certificate of title covering the
parcel of land now <span style="">in </span>litigation
having been derived from Original Certificate of Title No. 735, it follows that
these titles which were issued later should also be declared null and void in
the event the aforementioned deci­sion becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
or the same is affirmed by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The petition merely prays for an Order to be published at the
expense of the herein petitioners to enjoin all and sundry from disturbing the
physical possession of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span> of the parcel of land object of the petition and
which is included in the property covered by TCT Nos. 37677 and 37686.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that the petitioners were
in possession of the parcel of land object of this petition at the time that
the civil action before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ri­zal</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>,
was instituted and up to the present time (Exhi­bits 'B-2' to 'B-5').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that the petition was pub­lished
at the expense of the peti­tioners in the Daily Mirror <span style="">in its </span>issues of May 22, 29, and <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1965</st1:date> (Exhibit 'A').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Supreme Court in the
aforementioned case was promulgated on <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="5">May
 28, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
the lapse of more than ten years, it appears that said decision has not been
executed and the defendant in said case, <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>, who is one of the petitioners in the pre­sent
case, is still in possession of the parcel of land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the decisions in Civil Cases Nos.
3621, 3622, and 3623 of this Court, Branch II, as already stated above, it
would appear that the position of the petitioner that their possession should
not be dis<span style="">turbed until said decision is
reversed by the appellate court, is tenable.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREFORE, </span>finding
the petition to be well-taken, the same is grant­ed, and it is hereby ordered
that the respondents, their agents, and all persons acting for <span style="">and </span>in their be­half as well as all
others are here­by enjoined from disturbing the physical possession of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Qui­rino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>
of the parcel of land comprising 13.2619 hectares and in­cluded in the area
covered by said TCT Nos. 37677 and 37686, said no­tice <span class="GramE">having</span>
been published in a news­paper of general circulation as al­ready stated above.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their brief, appellants have assigned the fol­lowing alleged
errors of the lower court:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote>"THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ISSUING THE ORDER DATED 5 AUGUST
1965."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be gleaned from the above-quoted order, the relief sought
by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in their petition filed with the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> was virtually a general preliminary in­junction against the whole
world not to disturb their alleged possession of the two parcels of land
covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 37677 and 37686 of the office of
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span style="">issued </span>to appellant J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. upon the ground that in the three
other civil cases Nos. 3621, 3622 and 3623 of the same Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the said court has rendered a decision,
still pending appeal, declaring Original Certificate of Title No. 735 from
which the two above-mentioned titles have been derived null and void,
principally for want of jurisdiction of the court that issued said original
title on account of defects in the publication of the notices of the
proceedings for their registration, the injunction to last, per their prayer,
until the decision of this Court <span style="">in </span>the
said three civil cases, albeit the impugned order itself does not specify the
period of its duration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
sought such relief notwithstanding the admitted fact that in a previous case
filed by appellant <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> against <span class="SpellE">ap­pellees</span>
for the recovery of the possession of said land, that of <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>, 93 Phil. 106, wherein <span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span> had alleged among their defenses that appellant <span class="SpellE">Tuason's</span> titles were obtained "thru fraud or error and
without knowledge (of) or notice, either personal or thru publication to"
said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, this Court upheld the validity of the
questioned titles and affirmed the decision of the trial court "declaring
defendant (now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>)
to be without any right to the land in question and ordering him to restore
possession thereof to plaintiff (now appellant <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>)."
In the said deci­sion of this Court, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"As the land in dispute is covered by plaintiff's Torrens
certificate of title and was registered <span style="">in
</span>1914, the decree of registration can no longer be impugned on the ground
of fraud, error or lack of notice to defendant, as more than one year has
already elapsed from the issuance and entry of the decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither <span style="">could
the decree be collaterally attacked by any person claiming title <span class="GramE">to,</span> or interest in, the land prior to the registration
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Soroñgon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Maka­lintal</span>, [90<span style=""> </span>Phil. 259] 45 Off.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">. 3819.)</span>
Nor could title to that land in derogation of that </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">plaintiff, the registered own­er, be acquired by prescription or
adverse possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 46, Act No.
496.) Adverse, noto­rious and continuous possession under claim of ownership
for the period fixed by law is ineffective against a Torrens title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Valiente</span>
vs. Judge <span style="">of </span>CFI of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, [80 Phil. 415.] etc., 45 Off.</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., Supp. 9, p. 43.) And it is like­wise settled that the
right to secure possession under a decree of registration does not pres­cribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Francisco vs. Cruz, 43 <span class="GramE">Off</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 5105, 5109-5110).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A recent decision of this Court on this point
is that rendered in the case of Jose <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> et al.,
vs. Mariano et al., 92 Phil., 796.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
disposes of the al­leged errors </span><span style="">V
</span><span style="">and VI."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In these circumstances, the appealed order is en­tirely <span class="SpellE">propless</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leaving
aside all the other issues raised in appellants' brief about <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">adjudicata</span></u></span><span style="">,</span>
con­clusiveness of judgment and conclusiveness of the re­spondents-appellants'
Torrens Titles, it is obvious that the subject matter of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
petition was clear­ly beyond the competence and jurisdiction of the trial court
sitting as it did in this case as a land registration court, this, even on the
assumption, which is most doubtful, that such a general against-the-whole world
preliminary injunction could be sought in any court, it being axiomatic that an
auxiliary remedy cannot be secured unless there is <span style="">a </span>principal remedy to which it pertains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a land registration proceeding is ter­minated
and a corresponding decree has been issued, the only matter of possession of
the land involved that re­mains within the jurisdiction of the Land
Registration Court is in regard to the issuance of the writ of pos­session, if
one should be needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No provision of
the Land Registration Act (Act 496) or any other law has been cited by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and <span class="GramE">We</span> know of none
which authorizes the land registration court to resolve <span style="">issues </span>of posses­sion, in any of its aspects, after the original
regis­tration proceedings have come to an end and a writ of possession has
already been issued and implemented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 112 of Act 496 which is the only provision in the said law empowering
the land registration court to issue post or after-registration orders refers
exclu­sively to amendments and <span class="GramE">alterations of the title <span style="">is­sued </span>and has</span> nothing to do
with possession of the land at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> is not clear in
their brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seemingly, they are of the
belief that since the above-mentioned Original Certificate of Title No. 735
which was annulled was issued in the same LRC No. 7581 in which the present
petition was filed, it should follow that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>may act on their petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>' position
is not correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that
Original Certificate of Title No. 735 has been voided in so far as the titles
involved in Civil Cases Nos. 3621, 3622 and 3623, derived from said original
certificate of title, are concerned, does not mean that such declaration of
nullity affects also the other ti­tles, also derived from it but issued in the
names of other persons who have neither been heard nor notified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is elementary under the due process
principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although incidents regarding
any title derived from an original one are supposed to be filed in the same <span class="SpellE">expediente</span> or record of the original proceeding, the
incidents regarding each title so derived constitute separate and distinct
proceedings from those affecting the other titles derived from the same
original title, and are, accordingly, always treated <span style="">as </span>such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the very
fact that ordinary civil actions had to be filed by the plaintiffs in those
three civil cases relied upon <span style="">by </span><span class="SpellE">appellees</span> proves that the relief sought by them in their
petition in the court below may not be obtained in the form of a mere incident
in the original registration proceedings or <span class="SpellE">expediente</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­sides, as already noted earlier, there is
no showing that there is now pending <span style="">in
</span>the lower court either an action or any kind of proceeding <span style="">in </span>which <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are asking that Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 37677 and 37686 of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> should be annulled, assuming without
deciding that such a relief could still be available to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
<span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such being the case, the trial court placed the cart before the horse in
issuing its questioned or­der, for how could anyone be enjoined from disturbing
the possession of somebody whose right to such possession has not even been
alleged, much less established in an appropriate proceeding?</p>

<p class="BODY">Having come to this conclusion, <span class="GramE">We</span>
consider it unnecessary to resolve the <span style="">other
issues raised </span>by appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order <span style="">is </span>declared to have been issued beyond the jurisdiction of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> and it is hereby declared null and void and set
aside, with costs against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
