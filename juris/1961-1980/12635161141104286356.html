<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following day, June </span>18,
1966, <span style="">the lower court issued an order
requiring co-petitioner union to answer and appear before it on June </span>20,
1966 <span style="">to show <span class="GramE">cause</span>
why preliminary injunction should not issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, 1966, co-petitioner union filed a motion to dismiss
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, alleg­ing that the present labor dispute
was connected with an unfair labor practice charge previously filed by
petitioner on May 22, 1966 against respondent in the Court of Industrial
Relations for alleged violation of Sec. 4(a<span class="GramE">)(</span>1) and
(2) of Republic Act 875.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By an order of even date,
the lower court resolved the motion as follows:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Finding the Motion to Dismiss to be with­out merit, the Court
hereby denies it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Both parties agree, after counsel for de­fendants had
announced his intention to appeal this order to the Supreme Court, and the
Court hereby orders, that defendants or any of the members of the PAFLU shall
not molest nor pro­hibit the officials of plaintiff or any of its non-striking
employees when entering or getting out of the premises of plaintiff; that defen­dants
shall not destroy or cause any damage to the properties of plaintiff in the
premises in question; that defendants shall not coerce or threaten any person
in the premises; and that the alleged two stabs shall not perform any an­nouncing
work in the radio station nor do the duties of technicians except to guard and
keep maintenance work on the equipment of plaintiff, in the meantime that this
case is pending de­termination."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Without asking for a
reconsideration of the above-quoted order, petitioners instituted the present
special civil action of certiorari with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was given due course and this
Court issued preliminary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners admit that the order of June 20, 1966 did not even
amount to a restraining order issued by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They raise no question regarding the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only issue tendered is whether
the Court of First Ins­tance had jurisdiction over Civil Case 1697.</p>

<p class="BODY">A labor dispute involving an unfair labor practice is exclusively
cognizable by the Court of Industrial Relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court of First Instance has no jurisdic­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To establish this, however, there must be a
show­ing - not mere allegation - that the labor dispute either arose out of, or
is connected or interwoven with the un­fair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere filing of an unfair labor practice
charge in the Court of Industrial Relations does not, <span style="">per </span>se, establish the connection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So <span class="GramE">We</span> ruled in
United Pepsi-Cola Sales Organization v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Cañizares</span>,
102 Phil. 887, <span style="">89</span><span style="">1,</span><span style=""> </span>thru the pen of Justice J.B.L. Reyes –</p>

<blockquote>"We see nothing in the Company's com­plaint and petition for
preliminary injunc­tion that could apprise or warn the court below that an
unfair labor practice case was involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u><span style="">Nor can the lack of
jurisdiction of the lower court be simply assumed from the bare fact that an </span></u><u><span style="">unfair </span></u><u><span style="">labor practice case had been filed with the Court of Indus­trial
Relations.</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The criterion</u>, <u>to bring the case
under the jurisdiction of the </u></span><st1:street><st1:address><u><span style="">Industrial </span>Court</u></st1:address></st1:street>,
<u><span style="">is whether the acts complained of in</span>
the </u><u><span style="">petition </span></u><u><span style="">for injunction arose out </span></u><u><span style="">of</span></u><span style="">, </span>or <u><span style="">are connected or interwoven with, the unfair
labor practice </span>case</u>. (PAFLU <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>,
G.R. L-9104 Sept. 10, 1956), <span style="">a </span>question of fact that should be brought to the attention of
the court a quo to enable it to pass upon the issue whether it has jurisdiction
or not over the case. <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" </span>(Stressed for
emphasis)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule above-stated, based on the foregoing pro­nouncement, was
followed and reaffirmed in four subsequent cases wherein the lack of
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance was upheld because of the showing
that the labor dispute subject of the civil case was connected with the unfair
labor practices charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In ERLANGER
&amp; GALIN­GER v. ERLANGER &amp; GALINGER EMPLOYEES ASS'N., 104 Phil. 17, the
petitioner company admitted to the lower court that the labor dispute involved
an unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records
also disclosed that the strike and picketing arose from the unfair labor
practice charges <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> against <span class="GramE">petitioner
company</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In NATIONAL MINES &amp;
ALLIED WORKERS' <st1:place>UNION</st1:place> v. HON. ILAO, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-16884, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1"><span class="GramE">Jan. 31, 1963</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, the unfair la­bor
practice charge for discrimination was based particu­larly on the alleged
unjust <span style="">dismissal </span>of one Jorge <span class="SpellE">Patinio</span>, which dismissal caused the petitioning union to
stage a picket, thereby creating a labor dispute which respondent company
sought to enjoin in a civil case.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">In B.C.I. EM­PLOYEES &amp; WORKERS </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">UNION</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"> v. HON. MARCOS, G.R. No.</span>
L-21016, <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1965</st1:date>, the
unfair labor practice charges were based on the alleged unlawful dismissal of
union members because of union activities and the records showed that one of
the reasons for the strike which was sought to be enjoined was
"discrimination against union members in enforcement of disciplinary
actions." Finally, in CITIZENS' LEAGUE OF FREE WORKERS v. HON. ABBAS, G.R.
No. L-21212, Sept. 23, 1966, the complaint itself in the civil case contained
the allega­tion that plaintiff's refusal to recognize their auto­-<span class="SpellE">calesa</span> drivers as employees and bargain with them as such
was the cause of the strike staged by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, except for the bare allegation in
co-petitioner's motion to dismiss filed before the lower court and the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> allegations in par. IV of the petition, there
is no competent and satisfactory showing that the labor dispute object of Civil
Case <span style="">1697 </span>was connected or
interwoven with the acts constituting unfair labor practice covered in Case
1159-ULP filed in the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The connection could not even be inferred
from the charge which was couched in general language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners could very well have established
this connection in a motion for reconsidera­tion which they should have filed
first before resorting to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Withal, there is nothing to prevent peti­tioners from showing said
connection before the lower court in the proceedings to follow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the petition here must be dismissed for
now.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby dismissed and the
preliminary injunction heretofore issued is revoked and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against petitioners.</span></p>
