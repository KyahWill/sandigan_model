				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">On
May 19, 1964, the Insurance Company of North America, as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
to the consignee <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Tit &amp; Co. Inc., for having
paid the latter P21<span class="GramE">,040.69</span>, filed before the Court of
First Instance of Manila a complaint for recovery of the said amount plus
attorney's fees and costs against the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service and/or Bureau of Customs and/or A.R. Reyes &amp; Co., operator of the
Customs Bonded Warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount
sought to be recovered was the alleged loss to a shipment of sixteen (16)
cartons of Industrial Wheel </span><span style="">Brushes,
Measuring </span><span style="">Instruments and Hand Tools </span><span style="">discharged by </span><span style="">SS "<span class="SpellE">Lica</span> <span class="SpellE">Maersk</span>"
in good order condition into the custody of either of the defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
answer the Bureau of Customs and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service claimed, aside from their incapacity to sue or be sued, that the
plaintiff had no valid cause of action against them, there being no </span><span style="">showing that Act 3083, </span><span style="">as amended
by Commonwealth Act 327 has been complied with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A.R. Reyes &amp; Co., on the other hand, claimed that the complaint was
pre­mature because while six </span><span style="">(6)
</span><span style="">cartons
of cargoes with marks</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">"UTC-M-5871-062033
Manila” were received by its warehouse,</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the same had not yet been claimed by consignee nor has the
latter presented the necessary delivery permit in order that the cargo may be
discharged to the consignee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
plaintiff's motion, the court set the case for pre-­</span><span style="">trial on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="2"><span style="">February 20, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> at </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="9"><span style="">9:30 </span><span style="">A.M.</span></st1:time><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as the </span><span style="">parties </span><span style="">could not </span>reach any <span style="">settlement,
the case was set </span><span style="">for trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently,
on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="3"><span style="">March 11, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the complaint
was amended </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">include
the Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> as
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing was set for </span><st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4"><span style="">April </span><span style="">7, </span><span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
that </span><span style="">date,
the Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> had not
answered, so the </span><span style="">court could not
hear the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">10, </span><span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> the
Republic filed its answer adopting and <span class="SpellE">repleading</span> the
answer filed by defendants Bureau of Customs and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case, however, was not set for hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
</span><st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8"><span style="">August 31, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Court of First Instance dis­missed the case for plaintiff's lack of interest to
prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its motion for
reconsideration having been denied, the Insurance Company of </span><st1:place><span style="">North
 America</span></st1:place><span style=""> appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span> claiming </span><span style="">that the dismissal on such ground was an
error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff-appellant
relies on Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court which requires the court </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">hold a pre-trial before the case is
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a pre-trial has already been
had on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="2"><span style="">February 20, </span><span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">after which the case was set </span><span style="">for </span>trial
when the case could not be settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that an amended complaint was later, with leave of court, filed, did not
necessitate, under the circumstances, another pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been impractical, useless and
time consuming to call another pre-trial, considering that the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
merely adopted and <span class="SpellE">repleaded</span> all the pleadings of the
Bureau of Customs and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service.</p>

answer of the </span><span style="">Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, was
filed on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="5"><span style="">May 10,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After one year, three
months, and 21 days, or on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8"><span style="">August
 31, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court dismissed the case for failure to
prosecute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal was
proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A span of more than a year of
inactivity </span><span style="">on the part of the
plaintiff shows its lack of interest </span>in prosecuting the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While under the Rul<span style="">es, the clerk </span>of court has the duty to include a case in the
trial calendar after the issues are joined, and to fix the date for trial as
well as to notify the parties of the same, the plaintiff may not rely upon said
duty of the clerk nor is it relieved of its own duty to prosecute the case <span style="">diligently, calling
if necessary </span>the attention of the court to the need of put­ting the case
back to its calendar if the court, because of its numerous cases, has neglected
to attend thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>
