taken </span>by the heirs of the original claimant, the late <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bienvenido</span></span><span style=""> </span>Jordan, from a resolution en banc of
the Workmen's Compensation Commission dated February 29, 1968 setting aside the
decision rendered by its then Chairman, the Honorable N. <span class="SpellE">Baens</span>
del Rosario on July 10, 1967 ordering the respondent J. de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
Enterprises, Inc. - hereinafter <span style="">re­</span>ferred
to as the Company - to pay to the <span style="">aforesaid
</span>claimant compensation under the <span style="">provisions
</span>of the Work­men's Compensation Commission and other benefits under Act
3428, as amended, and remanding the case to the Regional Office, <span style="">Department </span>of Labor, for another
hearing on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 27, 1964 the now deceased <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Jordan filed with Regional Office No. 4, Department of Labor, Manila -
hereinafter referred to simply as Regional Office - a notice of injury or
sickness and claim for compensation against the Company - his employer -
arising from serious physical injuries sustained by him on December 31, 1963 as
a result of an accident that took place in the course of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Company failed to controvert the
claim, an award was made in favor of the claimant on June 3, 1964 by Regional
Administrator F. A. Fuentes, granting disability compensation in the amount of
P4,000.00 and reimbursement of medical, hospital and surgical expenses in the
total amount of P7,388.08.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1964</st1:date>,
the Company filed a petition to set aside the award and to set the claim for
hearing, but the petition was denied in an order of July 13 of the <span style="">same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter, the records of the case
were elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result thereof the Commission, through
Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span> Perez, issued an order
on <u>September 3, 1964</u> remanding the case <span style="">to </span><span class="GramE">the</span> Acting Chief of the Regional
Office for the reception of evidence on the nature and extent of the claimant's
injuries, his wages, and medical, surgical and hospital expenses, and declaring
further that the compensability of the <span style="">claim
would no longer be disputed in view of the Company's failure to controvert it
timely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Company filed a motion for the <span style="">reconsideration </span>of the order just
mentioned as well as <span style="">a </span>petition for the reinstatement of its right to
controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then mem­bers of the
Commission - Chairman N. <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario and Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span> Perez -
considered the motion and petition aforesaid but did not reach a decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Associate Commissioner
Perez issued </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">so called order dated </span><st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="12"><span style="">December
 3, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, let our Order of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9">September
 3, 1964</st1:date>, be modified, in the sense that the entire records of this
case should be, as it is hereby ordered, remanded to the Work­men's
Compensation Unit, Regional Office No. IV, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
for hearing and decision on its merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For her part, Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario rendered her own opinion, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For all the foregoing considerations, I vote for the denial
of the respondent's petition to reinstate its right to contro­vert and for the
affirmation of the Order dated September 3, 1964 remanding this case <span style="">to </span>the Regional office of origin
merely to enable the respondent to be heard in regard to medical, surgical and
hospital expenses allegedly incurred by the claimant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>second voting
gave the <span style="">same </span>result.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the case was remanded to the Regional Office where
herein petitioners filed a motion for partial execution of the award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this motion was denied, the case was again
elevated to the Commission pursuant to an order issued on <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1966</st1:date> by <span class="SpellE">Ata­nacio</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Mardo</span>, Acting Chief Referee and Chief of
Section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This second review of the case
ended with the original conflicting positions taken by Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario and Associate
Commissioner Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1966</st1:date> the former ordered that
the case be remanded to the Regional Office for compliance with the order dated
<st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9"><u><span style="">September 3, </span>1964</u></st1:date> penned by Associate
Commissioner Perez himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter,
for his part, penned a separate opinion expressing the view that his order of <u><span style="">September 3, 1964</span></u><span style=""> </span>had been modified by his other order
of <u><span style="">December 3 of the same year</span></u><span style=""> </span>which provided for the remanding of
the case to the Regional Office for the latter to hear and decide it on the
merits, without limitation as to the issues that the parties may deem fit to
raise.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1966</st1:date>, that <span style="">is, </span>after the issuance of the conflicting
orders just men­tioned, the Chairman of the Commission issued another order,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in accordance with the deliberations had by the
Commission en banc under the provisions of Sec. 4 of Rule 17 of the Rules of
the Commission, the Order dated Sept. 3, <span style="">1964,
deemed as original decision of Asso­ciate Commissioner Perez is declared
affirmed and the records of this case remanded to the Acting Chief of Referee
of Regional Office No. 4, Manila, for compliance therewith."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the record of the case had once more been remanded to the
Regional Office, the latter, through Acting Referee Pedro P. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, heard the case pursuant to the order of the
Commission of <u>September 3, 1964</u>, and afterwards rendered judgment on
April 4, 1967 awarding to the claimant disability compensation in the amount of
P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, medical expenses in the amount of
P10,120.63, and attorney's fees in the amount of P200.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">A month thereafter the claimant passed away and was subsequently
substituted by herein petitioners - his surviving widow and parents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1967</st1:date>
the Company filed a motion for a reconsideration of Referee <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>'
decision, claiming that it was rendered contrary to the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="12"><u>December 3, 1964</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied, and the case was
again elevated to the Commission for review pursuant to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a review of the case on appeal Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span>
del Rosario rendered a decision on July 10, 1967 (a) declaring void <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>' decision for lack of authority, his authority in the
premises being limited by the order of the Commission dated <u>September 3,
1964</u> to receiving evidence on the nature and extent of the claimant's in­juries,
his wages, medical, surgical and hospital expenses, but (b) awarding to the
claimant or his estate disability compensation in the amount of P4,000.00,
reimbursement of medical expenses in the amount of P8,914.90 and attorney's
fees in the amount of P400.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1967</st1:date>,
the Company filed a motion for the reconsideration of the Chairman's decision
and for the remanding of the case to the Regional Office for full proceedings
pursuant to the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="12"><u>December
 3, 1964</u></st1:date> issued by Associate Commissioner Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for reconsideration was resolved
by the Commission en banc after the retirement of Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario and after the appointment of additional
Associate Commissioners in the persons of <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>-Sotto and <span class="SpellE">Paciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Villavieja</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
resolution of the Commission en banc dated February 29, 1968 set aside the
abovementioned decision of Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del Rosario
of July <span style="">10, 1967 </span>and ordered the
remanding of the case to the Regional Office for full hearing on the merits
pursuant to the Perez' order of <u>December 3, 1964</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Villavieja</span>,
however, <span style="">dissented
</span><span style="">saying </span>the following:</p>

<blockquote>"The subsequent proceedings having been conducted pursuant to
the Order of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1964</st1:date>,
except as otherwise indicated in the decision in question, and finding the <span style="">same </span>to be
in accordance <span style="">with </span>law and
substantial evidence, <span style="">with­</span>out regard
to technicalities, legal forms, and technical rules of evidence, the decision
sought to be reviewed should be affirmed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the compensability of the claim under consideration is not
questioned, <span style="">We
are </span>now called upon to determine firstly, whether the controlling order
in the premises is that of <u><span style="">September
3, 1964</span></u><span style=""> </span>or that of
December 3 of <span style="">the same year; </span>secondly,
whether or not Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del Rosario's decision
of July 10, 1967 was rendered in accordance with law and the proceedings had as
mentioned heretofore; and lastly, whether or <span style="">not the last decision of the Commission en banc remand­ing the case
again to the Regional Office for a full hearing on the merits pursuant to the
Perez' order of </span><u><span style="">December </span>3,
1964</u> <span style="">should be affirmed or set
aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration of all the foregoing <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> are </span>of the
opinion, and so hold, that the order penned by <span style="">Asso­</span>ciate Commissioner Perez of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9"><u><span style="">September </span>3, 1964</u></st1:date>
is controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He issued said order in <span style="">his </span>capacity as reviewing Commissioner
pursuant to Section 2, Rule <span style="">16 of </span>the
Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As such, it was subject to appeal to the Commission en banc within 10
days from notice, by means of a motion for its reconsideration in accordance
with Section 1, Rule 17 <span style="">of the rules of
the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, in fact,
appealed to the Commission en banc when the Company filed on September 25, 1964
a motion for its reconsideration which was to be resolved in accordance with
Section 4, Rule 17 of the Rules of said Commission which provides that, for the
resolution of the appeal (in the form of a motion for reconsideration), two
affirmative or negative votes shall decide the appealed case; that in case of </span><span style="">a tie </span><span style="">vote due, either to the abstention of a
member of the Commission or to his continued absence for more than one week,
the case shall be calendared for another voting by the Commis­sion en banc, and
if this second vote again results in a tie, </span><u><span style="">the original or appealed decision or order shall<span style="">&nbsp; </span>be deemed affirmed</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>the instant
case, the Perez' order of <u>September 3, 1964</u> appealed to the Commission
en banc gave <span style="">rise to </span>a tie vote,
as already mentioned heretofore:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
Chairman voting for its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> and Commissioner
Perez – who was the one who penned the appealed order - voting for its
modification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the tie was not broken
with the second vote taken, then, pursuant to the provisions of Section 4, Rule
17 of the Rules of the Commission, the appealed order of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9"><u>September 3, 1964</u></st1:date> must be deemed to have
been affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, on
July 14, 1966 the Chairman of the Commission issued another order declaring
Commissioner Perez' order of <u>September 3, 1964</u> as <u>affirmed</u> and
ordered the remanding of the records of the case to the Acting Chief Referee of
the Regional Office for compliance there­with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record discloses that no appeal from this order was taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, conformably therewith,
the records of the <span style="">case </span>were again remanded to the Regional Office where a hearing
was held by Acting Referee <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, after which he
rendered his decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1967</st1:date>
in favor of the claimant.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated heretofore, the <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>'
decision of April 4, 1967 was set aside on appeal by Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del Rosario for the reason stated in her decision of
July 14, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">While in so far as it set aside referee <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>'
decision the correctness of the one rendered on July 10, 1967 by Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del Rosario is not entirely free from doubt, <span style="">We </span>believe
that whatever error in the premises was committed is not fatal nor did it cause
any substantial prejudice to the Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the assumption that pursuant to the order of the Commission of
September 3, 1964 the referee was authorized not only to receive evidence on
the matters therein mentioned but also to render judgment on the basis thereof,
the <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>' decision must be necessarily held
legal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even in such case, Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span>, de­cision of <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1967</st1:date> may legitimately be considered as one rendered on appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, slightly modifying the relief granted by the
decision of the referee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, assuming that the decision rendered by referee <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
was not within the scope of his authority as limited <span style="">by </span>the terms of the order of the Commission of September 3,
1964, it can then be said that Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del
Rosario acted correctly in setting it aside and thereafter rendering judgment
on behalf of the Commission strictly in accordance with the evidence of record.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered (a) declaring the
order of December 3, 1964 issued by Associate Commis­sioner <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>
Perez of no legal effect, and declaring that his own order of September 3, 1964
is valid and controlling as far as subsequent proceedings in the case were
concerned; and (b) reversing and setting aside the resolution of the Commission
en banc issued on February 29, 1968 and affirming the decision rendered by
Chairman <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del Rosario on July 10, 1967, the same
being in accordance with law and the conditions contained in the order of the
Commission of September 3, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
