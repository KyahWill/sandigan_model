				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before Us is a motion filed by <span style="">plaintiff-appellant praying </span>that <span style="">We </span>reconsider our decision promulgated
on September 29, 1967, upon the ground that the reservation to file a separate
civil action made at the trial of Criminal Case No. 4736 was <span style="">timely </span>made and that, therefore, the
doctrine of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>
does not bar the action <span style="">(Civil </span>Case
No. Q-6601) filed by her in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in our original decision, appellant <span style="">filed </span>the action aforesaid to <span style="">recover </span>from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the total <span style="">sum </span>of P37<span class="GramE">,636.35</span> as damages for the death of her daughter, Norma <span class="SpellE">Tactaquin</span>, and serious physical injuries inflicted upon her
on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1961</st1:date> when a car
recklessly driven by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> hit them at <span class="SpellE">Marulas</span>, Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with this accident, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was charged criminally (Criminal Case No. 4736, Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>) and was found guilty of
homicide, with serious physical injuries, through reckless imprudence, and was
sentenced not only to suffer imprisonment but also to pay the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,000</span> to appellant as damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
moved to dismiss the civil case for damages, upon the ground that the action
was already barred by the final judgment rendered in the criminal case just
mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sustaining this motion the
lower court dismissed the case, and appellant appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our original <span style="">decision affirmed </span>the order of
dismissal, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration now before
Us, We find that, according to the record, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
when arraigned in connection with Criminal Case No. 4736 mentioned heretofore,
pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when the
case was called for trial on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="8">August
 14, 1962</st1:date>, he was allowed to withdraw said plea and he immediately
entered a plea of guilty, the provincial fiscal forthwith recommending the
imposition of the corresponding penalty and <span style="">civil </span>liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the private prosecutor, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sundiam</span>, made this statement for the record:</p>

<blockquote>"May this representation be heard because we reserve the right
to civil <span class="GramE">liability.</span>”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">to</span> which the
Court replied -</p>

<blockquote>"That manifestation of the private prosecutor <span class="GramE">be</span> recorded." (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>. pp.
1-3, session of August 14, 1962)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record further discloses that notwithstanding the above
reservation and the Court's corresponding statement, the latter subsequently
proceeded to render judgment as stated heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the foregoing facts
it </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">clear, firstly, that the private
prosecutor timely made </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">reservation
on behalf of the offended party in connection with the filing of a separate
civil action; secondly, that such reservation was duly recorded by order of the
Court; thirdly, that, as a result thereof, the question of civil liability was
automatically taken out of the case and was not before the court any
longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these premises, the
conclusion becomes inescapable that the portion of the decision of the Court in
Criminal Case No. 4736 concerning civil indemnity was a nullity, and being so,
it can not be accorded the authority of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule in this connection <span style="">is </span>that when a criminal action is instituted, the civil action
for recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged is impliedly
instituted with it "unless the offended party expressly waives the civil
action or reserves his right to institute it separately".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the rule does not say when or at what
stage of the criminal proceeding the reservation should be made, it seems
logical to presume <span style="">that for the
reservation to be timely and legally effective, it must be made - as in the
present case - <u>before</u> the ren­dition of judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it has been held that once the offended
party has reserved his right to institute a se­parate civil action to recover
indemnity, he thereby loses his right to intervene in the prosecution of the
criminal case (<span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> vs. Honorable <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>, 52 0. G. p. 2526).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, herein appellant no longer
had any right - nor should she had been expected - to move for the
reconsideration of, much less to appeal from the decision in the criminal case
in so far as it decided the question of civil indemnity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She no longer had any standing in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, ruling upon appellant's motion for re­consideration,
the Court hereby </span><span style="">sets </span><span style="">aside its original decision and directs that
the present case be remanded below for further proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
