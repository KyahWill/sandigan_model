injunction filed with this Court by Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>,
as Acting Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
to forestall the alleged impending usurpation by suspended mayor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> of the position
he is presently occupying; and to question the validity of the orders of the
Court of Appeals granting new trial to the respondents who were convicted in
Criminal Case No. 18821 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
and ordering the remand of the records of said criminal case to the latter

<p class="BODY">After due trial, during which the parties presented their respective
documentary and testimonial evidence, the court rendered Judgment on 17 May
1969, finding that the contract for the purchase of 59 units of traffic
deflectors at P1,436.50 per unit, was mani­festly and grossly disadvantageous
to the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
and that it was made possible through a sham bidding and a series of
falsifications participated in by most of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, accused Mayor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, Councilors <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span>

guilty as charged, and each was sentenced to a prison term of 6 years, with
perpetual disqualification to hold public office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the Provincial Sheriff was ordered

were acquitted for insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="5">17 May 1961</st1:date>,
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> and Councilors <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Babasa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nonato</span> perfected
their appeal to the Court of Appeals, where the case was docketed as CA-G. R.
No. 10250-CR.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="11"><span style="">28
 November 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">,
appellants <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, et al., filed in the Court of
Appeals a motion for new trial, based allegedly on newly discovered and
material evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence referred
to consisted of the testimony of Acting Provincial Auditor <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
S. </span><span class="SpellE">Declaro</span>, who allegedly discovered in the
latter part of May, 1969, or after the appealed decision had been promulgated,
that when the contract for the purchase of the deflectors was entered into, the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
had an overdraft and, therefore, had no funds available to cover such purchase;
and that the contract (Exhibit "E") does not have the necessary
certification by the municipal treasurer as to the availability of funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion
for new trial was accompanied by an affidavit of Auditor <span class="SpellE">Declaro</span>
to that effect, and a joint affidavit by appellants stating that they learned
of the state of the municipality's finances only on <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="7">24 July 1969</st1:date> when so informed by <span class="SpellE">Declaro</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required by the Court of Appeals to comment on the motion, the
Solicitor General, representing <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> People of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in effect offered no objection to the granting of the motion for new trial,
opining that favorable action thereon would do no violence to judicial
processes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, on 31 January
1970, the Court of Appeals, taking note that the circumstances pointed out by
Auditor <span class="SpellE">Declaro</span> were not, and could not have been,
known to the appellants; that the trial judge who rendered the appealed
judgment had already previously granted a new trial to two other accused who
did not appeal (<span class="SpellE">Lutgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
and Jose San Mateo), and that the subject matter of the prosecution is one of
first im­pression and of serious consequences, granted the motion for new trial
and ordered the remand of the case to the court <u><span style="">a quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>for new
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, at the instance of the
appellants, another resolution was promulgated by the appellate court on <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="2">9 February 1970</st1:date> declaring the order
(granting new trial) final and directing the immediate remanding of the records
of the case to the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 13
February 1970, herein petitioner filed the present petition for the purposes
earlier stated; and, as prayed for, this Court issued writs of preliminary
injunction against the Court of Appeals, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to restrain enforcement of the disputed orders of
the appellate court, and the holding of new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition questions the legality of the grant of a new trial
by the Court of Appeals, as being contrary to law and established
jurisprudence, averring that the alleged newly discovered evidence could have
been discovered even before the decision of the Court of First Instance by
exercise of due diligence; that said evidence is not of such character as would
change the result when taken in connection with the evidence already on
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further avers that
the motion and grant of new trial and the remand of the records to the court
below before the expiration of the standard 15 days set by the Rules, were part
of a plan to secure a reinstatement of the accused to the positions they
formerly held, and the ouster of petitioner from his post as Acting Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the petition, the Solicitor General, on 23 February
1970, sided with the petitioner and pleaded that there was no showing that the
alleged newly discovered evidence sought to be presented will be likely change
the result of the case; that the facts and circumstances surround­ing the
contract entered into by appellants-<span class="SpellE">movants</span> for the
supply of traffic deflector mirrors, such as the fact that they were shown to
be grossly overpriced and totally useless for the purpose for which they were
acquired, that the law on public bidding was not followed, the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> undue haste in pushing the transaction through,
the paying of the voucher before it was signed by the treasurer, the failure of
the accused to see the deflectors themselves, and the appropriation of money
for the purchase before the award was made, show the guilt of the accused
despite the averred nullity of the contract of <span style="">purchase without the treasurer's previous certificate of availability of
funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor </span>General
further pleaded that for a violation of Section 3 (g) of the Anti-Graft Law
(Republic Act No. 3019) <span style="">it is not
necessary that </span>the contract therein mentioned be perfectly valid <span style="">and binding, so long as </span>the
transaction entered into in behalf of the Government be manifestly and grossly
disadvantageous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that the
Court of Appeals' order for new trial be vacated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>, et al., denied any intent to reassume their
offices unless authorized by the courts; pleaded that they filed a motion for
their reinstatement in the Court of First Instance, on 14 February 1970, only
to stop speculations that they would take over their respective offices without
judicial authorization; and that the petition had no cause of action for q<u>uo
<span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u> and petitioner had no personality
whatsoever to object to the motion for new trial, not being a party to the
criminal case wherein it was granted; that petitioner is not the offended party
in said criminal case, nor could he question or appeal from the grant of new
trial, since the fiscal and the Solicitor General are the ones authorized to
represent the People, and these had not opposed the new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They further alleged that the court of
Appeals' order for new trial and for the immediate entry thereof were proper
and legal, the People having favorably endorsed the new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As special defenses, they claimed that the
petitioner had neither personality to institute the proceedings nor has any
cause of action; that only the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could do so; that the grant of new trial has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; and that <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition are not a substitute for timely appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We consider it unnecessary, at present, for brevity's sake, to
render an opinion on the question of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano's</span>
personality to institute these proceedings in view of the Solicitor General's
answer to the petition, practically adopting the latter and praying for the
vacating of the <span style="">questioned resolutions
of the Court of </span>Appeals, granting the motion for new trial of private
respondents <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, et al., and remanding the
records to the court of origin without awaiting the expiration of the normal
period of 15 days prescribed by the Rules for the finality of said orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said answer on behalf of the Republic is and should
be treated as its own petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General, in representation of
the Re­public, <span style="">the </span>prosecutor
and complainant in Criminal Case No. 18821 <span style="">of Branch VI of the Court of First </span>Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
has unquestionable per­sonality to assail the grant of new trial therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This the other respondents concede.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
</span>no objection to the application for a prerogative writ that the <span style="">Solicitor </span>General had previously
expressed no objection to the res­<span style="">pondents'
motion for </span>new trial, as filed in the Court of Appeals, for nothing bars
the Solicitor General from changing opinion upon a more detailed and thorough
consideration of the facts and the law; and, anyway, <span style="">it is a well known and settled rule in our jurisdiction that the
Republic or its government, <span style="">is usually </span>not
<span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by mistake </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">error on the part of
its officials or agents.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, the correctness, validity and
legality of a grant of new trial in a criminal case do not depend upon </span>the
consent <span style="">of the parties thereto, but
upon the grant being made conformably to the prescriptions of the Rules of
Court and the applicable jurisprudence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the action taken by the Solicitor General in this case
barred by the lack of a seasonable appeal or of an apposite motion to
reconsider the questioned resolutions of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so far as they vacated the judgment of
conviction rendered by the court of origin and decreed a new trial, said orders
resolved no questions with finality; they were in fact interlocutory, and,
therefore were not independently <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> (Rule 41,
section 2; Rule 122, section 1, Revised Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has ruled that a grant of new
trial is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> since it is not a final
judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the non-filing of a motion for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals
itself foreclosed this remedy by ordering the remand of the records to the
court of origin even before the 15-day period for finality had expired.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, in </span><u><span style="">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span></span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">(97
Phil. 398), this Court upheld as proper the filing of </span><span style="">a </span><i style=""><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> and prohibition case to question a trial court's order granting a
motion for new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Explaining the
action taken by this Court, we said in that case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"To avoid any misapprehension and to explain why we
entertained the present petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition with preliminary injunction over an order granting a motion for
new trial, it should be stated that in civil cases the granting of a new trial
is considered a mere interlocutory order not subject to appeal or special civil
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that the party
dissatisfied with the order granting new trial may, after judgment, appeal from
the same and include in his appeal the supposed error committed in the issuance
of the interlocutory order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in
a criminal case like the present, that theory or procedure of appeal in due
time may not be practical or satisfac­tory for the reason that at the
conclusion of the new trial, the trial court deciding the case anew, may acquit
the defendant and thereafter the prosecution would have no more opportunity of
bringing before the appellate court the question of the legality or illegality
of the order granting a new trial because the defendant acquitted may plead
double jeopardy." (<span class="SpellE">Cas</span>. cit. at page 414).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We now proceed to the
main issue in these proceedings:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was the
grant of a new trial for allegedly <span style="">newly
discovered evidence granted </span>improvidently and in grave abuse of
discretion?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We answer the question in
the affirmative, because the action of the Court of Appeals was not in
conformity with the applicable provisions of Rule 124, in connection with Rule
121 and Rule 53.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By Section 13 of Rule
124,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Motion for
new trial</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- At any time after the
appeal from the lower court has been perfected and before the judgment of the
appellate court convicting the accused becomes final, the latter may move for a
new trial on the ground of newly dis­covered evidence material to his defense,
the motion to conform to the provisions of section 3, Rule 121."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion for new trial
of respondents <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, et al., accused in the court
below is anchored on Section 2 (b) of Rule 121, i.e., that new and material
evidence has been discovered which (1) the defendant <u>could not with
reasonable diligence have discovered</u> and produced <u>at the trial</u>; and
(2) which if introduced and <u>admitted would probably change</u> the judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Now, it will be recalled
that the proffered new evidence consisted of the testimony of auditor <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Declaro</span>, substantially to
the effect that after testifying at the trial in the court of origin he
discovered for the first time that the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
had an overdraft and, therefore, did not have the necessary funds to cover such
purchase; that upon examination of the contract itself, it was found to be
without the necessary certification of the municipal treasurer regarding availability
of funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; that the execution of the contract
without such certificate of the municipal treasurer renders the contract null
and void, pursuant to Sections 607 and 608 of the Revised Administrative Code;
that the foregoing information was relayed by <span class="SpellE">Declaro</span>
to respondents only in July, 1969, or after the promulgation of the decision in
the criminal case and the said respondents had perfected their appeal to the
Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Measured against the
recognized standards on newly-discovered evidenc</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">, the above testimony
of the auditor clearly falls short of the requirement for the holding of a new
trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">First, because for the
purposes of the Rules, <span class="SpellE">Declaro's</span> detection of the sad
condition of the municipality's finances can hardly be called a newly-discovered
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The financial position of the
municipality in 1967 is a matter that the then incumbent Provincial Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
who were accused together with the herein respondents in Criminal Case No.
18821, should have known all along and could have presented during the hearing
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it was stated in <span class="SpellE">Declaro's</span> affidavit, attached to the motion for new trial,
"that actually the Municipal Treasurer used <u>trust funds</u> of the
municipality to partially pay" (Affidavit, paragraph 5) for the articles
initially delivered (P4</span><span style="">3</span><span style="">,956.90, for the 34 units delivered, at
P1,436.50 each less 10% retention),</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> thereby indicating that said municipal
official was <u>actually aware</u> of the lack of available and uncommitted
funds to cover the purchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That must
even be the reason why he did not certify that there were available funds for
the purpose:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>because he knew that there
were none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is unconceivable that
the other accused did not discover this fact at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it may be pointed out that for the
duration of the criminal case, i.e., from </span><st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="1"><span style="">18 January 1969</span></st1:date><span style=""> when the information was filed in court up
to </span><st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="5"><span style="">17 May 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">
when the decision was rendered, respondents were occupying their respective
positions as mayor and councilors of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makati</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
could have obtained with facility the information about the financial condition
of the municipal government when the questioned contract was entered into had
they wanted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, how­ever, they
failed to do, and nothing appears in the records to explain such failure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> not even the detention of the accused </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">considered sufficient justification for his failure to present the
alleged new testimonies, this Court reasoning that he could have secured and
presented the "new" witnesses during the original trial, through his
relatives and friends, or through compulsory process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is, the evidence now relied upon by the
respondents <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, et al., amounts to no more than
forgotten proof, the belated uncovering of which would not justify </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">order to conduct a new trial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second, herein respondent
municipal officials were charged with violation of Republic Act 3019 under its
Section 3(g), or specifically, for having <u>entered</u>, on behalf of the
government, into a <u>contract or </u></span><u><span style="">transaction manifestly</span></u><span style="">
and <u>grossly</u></span><u> </u><u><span style="">disadvantageous</span></u><span style=""> to the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not at all difficult to see that to
determine the culpability of the </span>accused under such provision, it need
only be established that the <span style="">accused is
a public officer; that he entered into a contract or transaction on behalf of
the government; and that such contract or transaction is grossly and manifestly
disadvantageous to that government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the act treated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> partakes of
the nature of a <span class="SpellE"><u>malum</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">prohibitum</span></u>;
<span style="">it is </span>the commission of that act
as defined by the law, not the character or effect thereof, that determines
whether or not the provision has been violated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And </span>this construction would be in consonance with the announced
purpose for which Republic Act 3019 was enacted, which is the repression of
certain <u>acts</u> of public officers and private persons constituting graft
or corrupt practices or which may lead thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Note that the law does not merely contemplate repression of acts that are unlawful
or corrupt <u>per se</u>, but even of those that may <u>lead to or result</u>
in graft and corruption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, to
require for conviction under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act that the
validity of the contract or transaction be first proved would be to enervate,
if not defeat, the intention of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For what would prevent the officials from entering into those kinds of
transactions against which Republic Act 3019 <span style="">is </span>directed, and then deliberately omit the observance of
certain formalities just to provide <span style="">a </span>convenient
leeway to avoid the clutches of the law in the event of discovery and
consequent prosecution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present
case, <span style="">assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
</span>that the absence of certification by the municipal treasurer as to
availability of covering funds would materially affect the validity of the
contract, that matter would be immaterial to the determination of respondents'
liability under Republic Act 3019; so that the discovery of such fact would not
constitute a proper ground to support a motion for the reopening and retrial of
the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the improvidence of the action taken by the Court of Appeals
goes further than the disregard of the specific requirements that newly
discovered evidence should meet to justify granting a new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It goes deeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 17 of Rule 124, provides that -</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Application
of certain rules in civil to criminal cases</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- ­The provisions of Rules 46 to 56 relating
to pro­cedure in the Court of Appeals and in the Supreme Court in original as
well as appealed civil cases shall, in so far as they are applicable and not in­consistent
with the provisions of this rule, be applied to criminal cases."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">One of the rules thus made applicable to criminal cases is Rule
53, Section 2 of which requires that in granting or refusing a new trial
"the Court of Appeals <u>shall</u> consider the new evidence <u>together</u>
with that adduced in the Court below" (emphasis supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose is clearly to have the new
evidence weighed in conjunction with the old, in order to <span style="">ascertain whether the new proofs tendered
would probably change the result, as required by Section 2(b) of Rule 121.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the questioned resolution does it
appear that both the "new" and the "old" evidence were considered
jointly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the Court of Appeals
could not then have done so, for the petitioner avers, and it is not denied,
that when the motion for new trial was filed, the testimony of the witnesses at
the original trial was not yet transcribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With these violations of the Rules of Court thus made patent, we
have no alternative but to conclude that the grant of the motion for new trial
by the Court of Appeals <span style="">was </span>made,
not only in error, but with grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are left with no
alternative but to disavow and set aside the actuations of the <st1:street><st1:address>Appeals
  Court</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for is granted and the order of
the Court of Appeals granting a new trial for newly discovered evidence in its
Case CA-G. R. No. 10250-CR, as well as its order remanding the records of the
case to the court of origin, are hereby revoked and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals is consequently
instructed to recall and proceed with said criminal case until its termination
in con­formity with the applicable law and rules of court.</p>

injunction heretofore issued are made permanent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ZALDIVAR, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the re­solution penned by my worthy colleague, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
in so far, as it orders the annulment and the setting aside of all proceedings
and the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
in its Election Cases Nos. 3653, 3654, 3655, 3656, 3657 and 3659 in connection
with the correction of the election returns in six precincts of San Luis, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, as it orders the said court to hear anew the
correction pro­ceedings with due notice to the candidates affected and to have
before it all copies of the election re­turns sought to be corrected, and in
that connection as it orders the opening of the ballot boxes in the precincts
concerned and conduct a summary and arithme­tical recounting or the ballots
pertaining to the candidates, and thereafter to issue the appropriate reso­lution
on the basis of the evidence before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">My concurrence, however, should be understood as simply agreeing
in the resulting effect <span style="">of </span>the
reso­lution, to remedy a situation brought about by the <span style="">un­usual, </span>circumstances that attended the attempted cor­rection
of the election returns in six precincts of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>San Luis</st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
in connection with the national elections of <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">These </span>unusual
circumstances are as follows:</p>

11, 1969, in precincts Nos. 9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of San Luis, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> became known to the public right on the day after
the elections, as stated in the election returns, the copies of which, in every
polling place of the above-mentioned precincts, were duly distributed, as
required by law, -- that is, one copy was deposited in the ballot box, one copy
furnished the municipal treasurer of San Luis, one copy was sent to the
provincial treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and one was sent to
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->When the provincial board or canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> met on December 11, 1969 to canvass the elec­tion
returns from all the precincts in the second representative district or <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, candidate Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
questioned the validity, and sought the ex­clusion from the canvass, of the
election returns (copies for the Provincial Treasurer) from seven pre­cincts of
San Luis, upon the alleged ground that they were prepared at gun point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This matter <span style="">was </span>brought to the attention of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not entertain the claim of <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> that those election returns were prepared at gun point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A tentative tabu­lation of the result of the
election for Representative in the second representative district of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> indicated that candidate Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> had a lead some 247 votes over candidate <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of
cer­tain controversies regarding election returns, aside from those seven
returns from San Luis, it was not until<span style="">
</span><st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1970</st1:date>
when the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> issued a resolution resolving the

proclamation of the winning candidate be made on <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->On January 27, 1970, or the day after the <span class="SpellE">Come­lec</span> had issued its resolution, there were filed with
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> seven
petitions for the correction of the election returns in Precincts Nos. 9, 15,
16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of San Luis, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for the petition for correction of the
election return for precinct 9 which was signed only by the Chairman and the
poll clerk, all the other petitions were signed by all the members of the boards
of inspectors for those precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
noteworthy that in spite the fact that the six precincts in question were
located in different places in San Luis, the allegations in the petitions were
more or less uniform to the effect that after the canvassing and counting of
the ballots armed men entered the polling place, fired shots in the air and the
people watching the proceedings scampered for safety, that despite the commotion
and confusion the members of the boards of inspectors did their best <span style="">to comply with their duty of preparing the
election returns, but in the course of the confusion and com­motion they made
the mistake of crediting candidate <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> with much <span style="">less </span>votes than what he had really
obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitions made no mention
of any mis­take in entering in the election returns the votes obtained by the
other candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be noted that
the petitions for correction were made on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="1"><span style="">Janua­ry 27, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, or more than two months and a half after
the elections, and the petitions contained allegations which contradicted the
previous claim of candidate <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> that the election
returns in those precincts were prepared at gun point.</span></p>

</span>Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, right on

snow that only </span>the votes of candidate <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
were corrected, such that his votes which originally appeared in the election

candidate <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> and the other candidates <span style="">listed on the </span>election returns
remained <span style="">the </span>same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a

candidate <span class="SpellE">Tig­lao</span> was credited with 292 additional
votes in those six precincts, or so many votes as to exceed by 45 votes the
lead of candidate <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> who, in the tentative canvass
before the filing of the petitions for cor­rection, had a lead of 247 votes.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">8.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->As finally ordered corrected, it appeared on the
six election returns, in summing up in every pre­cinct the number of voters who
voted and the votes ob<span style="">tained </span>by
all the candidates for Representative, that there were 273 more votes that were
cast for candidates for Representative than the number of voters who actually
voted in those precincts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the circumstances I
have above related, I can not help but arrive at a conclusion, nay a
conviction, that the petitions for the correction of those six election returns
were merely a device resorted </span>to <span style="">by
the supporters of candidate <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> in order that </span>the
lead of 247 votes of candidate <span class="SpellE">Sanga</span> could be over­come
and that the correction proceedings <span style="">are
</span>anomalous, irregular, and illegal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is why I concur with the majority that the proceedings and the
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
in connection <span style="">with </span>the
correction or those six election returns should be set aside and annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The returns as ordered cor­rected in the
proceedings, to me, are worthless and must not be included in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, because it is necessary that the
winning candidate for Representative in the second district of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> has to be proclaimed on the basis of election
returns that ref­lect more or less the true result of the elections in those
six precincts of San Luis, it becomes necessary <span style="">that a recourse be had to the arithmetical count of the ballots inside
the ballot boxes in those pre­cincts, if it is shown that those ballot boxes
and the contents therein have not been tampered with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is my view, however,
that the expedient re­sorted to by this Court of opening the ballot boxes in
order to ascertain the </span><span style="">correct
count of </span><span style="">the votes cast in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">six precincts in question is not contem­plated </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Section 154 of the Revised Election Code in the matter regarding </span><span style="">correction of election returns. <span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">The
procedure now adopted by this Court should </span><span style="">only be considered as a special </span><span style="">or extraordinary remedy in order </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">prevent an injustice,
or to prevent a mockery of the elections held in the six precincts of San Luis,
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pampanga</span></span><span style="">, now </span><span style="">in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe that the
procedure of ordering the opening the </span><span style="">ballot box </span><span style="">and count the
votes in correction proceedings under Section </span>154 of <span style="">the </span><span style="">Revised Election Code should not be taken as </span>a <span style="">precedent in the construction or
interpretation or </span>said <span style="">Section
154.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 154 of the
Revised Election Code provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"<u>Alterations in the
statement</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>After <span style="">the announcement </span>of the result of the
elec­tion in the polling place, the <span style="">board
of </span>inspectors shall not make any alteration or amendment in any of the statements,
unless it be so ordered by a competent court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is my considered view </span>that
<span style="">what is contem­plated in the
above-quoted section of the Revised Election Code are honest mistakes committed
by the members of the board of inspectors in the course of </span><span style="">making the entries </span><span style="">required by law in the election return,
because as this </span><span style="">Court has said
"Mistakes of </span><span style="">all sorts are
too common in human </span><span style="">experience
to </span><span style="">justify </span><span style="">any one in denying the possibility of honest
error...; and it was in contemplation of the possibility of </span>such errors
that <span style="">the </span>lawmakers provided for
their correc­tion with judicial approval".<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It can be gathered from a reading of the provision of Section 154 that before
the announcement by the board of inspectors of the result of the election in
the polling place the members of the board can make all the corrections in the
election returns prepared by them that may be ne­cessary in order to make the
entries in the election returns reflect the true and correct result <span style="">of </span>the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is also the duty of the members of the
board of inspectors that upon the completion of the statements of the election
returns, the chairman of the board shall orally and publicly announce the total
number of votes polled in said election, in the said precinct by each and
everyone of <span style="">the </span>candidates,
naming them for each one of the offices,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and that after the announcement of the result of the election in the polling
place the board shall place one of the copies of the election return in the box
for valid ballots, deliver one to the municipal treasurer, send another copy by
registered mail to the provincial treasurer, and another, likewise by
registered mail, to <span style="">the Commission on </span>Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and after the publication of <span style="">the result
</span>of the election and before leaving the polling place it shall be the <span style="">duty of the </span>board of inspectors to
issue a certificate of the number or votes received by a candidate, or by the
opposing candidates, for a national or provincial of­fice, for city councilor
or for mayor or vice-mayor, to the watchers who may request them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the members <span style="">of the </span>board shall sign the certificate.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
But after the announcement of the result of the election in the <span style="">polling </span>place it can happen that the
members of <span style="">the </span>board of
inspectors would discover that they committed a mistake -- an honest one --
such as an error in crediting the number of votes for a particular candidate or
a difference in the number of votes written in figures <span style="">and </span>the number written in words, and the like, and they consider
it necessary to correct the honest mistakes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But because they have already announced the result of the election in
the polling place they cannot make this correction by themselves, even <span style="">it </span>they all agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They can do <span style="">this </span>only <span style="">by </span>authority
of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that
"Where the board of inspectors has announced the result of<span style=""> </span>the election in a polling place its
powers and duties end, and it may not with­draw the returns, add to, change or
alter them and make new returns, unless it be so ordered by a competent
court."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that the mistake or error contemplated <span style="">in Section 154 </span>must be an honest one,
and it is a mis­take that is common and known to all the members of the board
of inspectors -- that is why the petition to the court for that authority to
make tree correction must be by unanimous consent of all the members of the
board of inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also my view,
that the cor­rection that all the members of <span style="">the </span>board of inspector would ask the court to authorize must
relate to errors, mistakes, commissions or oversight that all the members of
the board of inspectors came to discover or to find out, <span style="">and </span>agreed upon by ail or them, <u><span style="">soon after the pub</span>lication or the
result of the election in the polling </u><u><span style="">place</span></u><span style=""> </span>or
within a reasonable time thereafter and before the canvass of the votes by the <span style="">board of canvas­</span>sers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would also add that once such petition for
co reaction <span style="">is </span><span style="">filed </span>with the competent court, the
court should immediately conduct a hearing <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>and satis­fy himself from the
evidence presented, which should consist or at least the testimonies of all the
member of the board of inspectors, whether the correction prayed for should be
authorized or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Judge
should have before him the <span style="">election
return </span><span style="">that </span>is sought to
be corrected, as it would be irregular, not to say absurd, for a Judge to order
the correction or so important a document as an election <span style="">return, </span><span style="">where </span>the public has an interest, without even looking at the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeding for the
correction election return forms <span style="">part </span>of
the <span style="">pre-proclamation </span><span style="">pro­</span>ceedings which should be done with
dispatch in order that the winning candidate in an election is proclaimed with
the least delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The court should act </span><span style="">with,
</span><span style="">dis­</span>patch, in the
exercise of its sound discretion, whether to authorize the correction or
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the Judge has acted one way or
the other, - either to authorize or not to authorize, the correction, the
proceeding must end there, except perhaps if it can be shown <span style="">that </span><span style="">the </span>judge had acted in such a capricious or whimsical manner as
to warrant <span style="">an action </span>by way of <i style="">certiorari</i> to correct his actuation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I do not agree with </span>the
majority of this Court that <span style="">a </span>Judge in correction proceedings under Section 154 may go to
the extent of having the ballot box opened and make an arithmetical count of
the votes cast in favor of the candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wish to repeat that the correction contemplated in Section 154 <span style="">of </span>the Revised Election Code refers to
the correction of honest errors, mistakes or oversight on the part of all the
members of the board of inspectors and agreed to by all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly this section does not contemplate a
correction of an election return under circumstances that indicate bad faith on
the part of the parties in­terested in the correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This bad faith becomes specially obvious if
the correction is sought long after the elections are over and a tentative
canvass of <span style="">the </span>votes had already
been made by the board of canvassers, as had happened in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court must consider the circumstances
attending the filing <span style="">of the </span>petition
for correction, and should exercise its discretion, whether to authorize the
correction or not, promptly and firmly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As this Court has said in <span style="">the case </span>of Estrada vs. Navarro<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
"the proceeding for correction is a summary one, is not supposed to raise
controversial issues, and does not call for <span style="">a </span>recount or revision of the ballots themselves, <span style="">either </span>of which contemplates a
different remedy."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I
</span>am afraid that the majority opinion in the <span style="">Res</span>olution has so construed Section 154 <span style="">of the Revised </span>Election Code in a manner that amounts to
judicial legislation, which, I believe, this Court should <span style="">not </span>do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have misgivings that the application of <span style="">Section 154 </span>of the Revised Election
Code as stated in <span style="">the </span>rationale
of the resolution will open the door, in future elections, to practices that
will delay <span style="">rather than expedite the </span>proclamation
of the winning candi­dates in an election, if not altogether frustrate the
election of candidates who really are the choice <span style="">of the </span>electorate.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
