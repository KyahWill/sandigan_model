CA-G.R. No. 28297-R, affirm­ing, with modifications, the decision of the Court
of First Instance of Zamboanga City in its Civil Case No. 574 - for breach of
contract of carriage - wherein herein petitioners-appellants, along with their
driver named Valeriano Marcos,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
were condemned to pay damages to herein private respondent minor Jose Mario
Dagamanuel, for the deaths of his father and mother while on board a passenger
bus owned (by purchase) and operated by petitioner-appellant Zamboanga Transpor­tation
Co., Inc. but which, at the time of the mishap causing the deaths referred to,
was still registered with the Public Service Commission in the name of peti­tioner-appellant
Zamboanga Rapids Co., Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal being purely on question of law, We quote the
antecedent facts, as set forth in the pertinent portions of the decision of the
Court of Appeals appealed from, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the evening of August 13, 1955, the spouses Ramon and
Josefina Daga­manuel boarded a bus at Manicahan, Zam­boanga City, to attend a
benefit dance at the Bunguiao elementary school, also in Zamboanga City, where
Josefina was a public school teacher.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the dance, the couple boarded the same bus to re­turn to
Manicahan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At around 1 o'clock in the
early morning of August 14, 1955, the bus, with plate 1955 TPU-11327, and
driven by Valeriano Marcos, fell off the road and pinned to death the said
spouses and several other passengers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff, the only child of the deceased spouses,
through his ma­ternal grandmother, as guardian <u>ad</u>-<u>litem</u>, instituted
this action against the de­fendants Zamboanga Transportation Co., Inc. and the
Zamboanga Rapids Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Zamtranco and Zambraco,
respectively) for breach of contract of carriage, alleging that the accident
was due to the fault and negligence of the driver in operating the bus and due
to the negligence of the defendant companies in their supervision of their
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff asks for actual or
compensatory damages in the sum of P40,000, moral damages in the sum of P40,000,
exemplary damages in the sum of P20,000, attorney's fees in the sum of P5,000
and costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Zamtranco filed a third-party complaint against the
driver Marcos, admitting that 'it is the owner by purchase of Motor Vehicle
with plate number 1955 TPU-11327 and employer' of said driver, but contending,
among others, that the said driver had no authority to drive the bus, hence,
the driver alone should be adjudged liable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, the said defendant company alleged that with intent to
place his property beyond the reach of the creditors, the driver sold his
property to his brother, hence its additional prayer that the sale executed by
the driver be declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Zambraco also filed a third-party complaint a­gainst the driver,
admitting that 'it is the registered owner of Motor Vehicle with plate number
1955 TPU-­11327 and employer of herein third-party defendant' (the driver), but
also contending, among others, that the accident occurred due solely to the
negligence of the driver for taking out the bus without authority from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also asked for the an­nulment of the deed
of sale made by the driver of his property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Answering the complaint, the Zambraco alleges that it is
engaged in land transportation business and that at the time of the accident it
was the registered owner of the ill-fated vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In exculpation, it denies that Marcos was
authorized to operate the vehicle when it met with the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its own answer, the Zamtranco admits that
it is also en­gaged in land transportation business at the time of the
accident, and like­wise claims that Marcos had no autho­rity to operate the
vehicle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finding that (1) the Zamtranco and the Zambraco were under
one ma­nagement at the time of the accident, (2) the accident was due to the neg­ligence
of the driver who was under their employ; and (3) the sale made by Marcos of
his property was done with intent to defraud his credit­ors, the trial court
rendered judg­ment (1) sentencing the three, jointly and severally, to pay the
plaintiff P16,000 for the death of the spouses, P4,000 as exemplary da­mages,
P2,000 as attorney's fees, and costs; and (2) annulling the deed of sale
executed by Marcos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All the three defendants appeal­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcos' appeal was later dis­missed; hence as
to him the judgment is already final and executory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In their joint brief, the two appellant companies allege that
the trial court erred in (1) ‘deciding the case against the defendant Zamboanga
Transportation Company, Inc., it being the wrong party’; (2) ‘awarding damages
based on an alleged con­tract of carriage’; (3) ‘misquoting the very provision
on which it based its decision, and consequently gave a substantively wrong
interpretation of the same to the detriment of the appellants’; (4) ‘awarding
excessive compensatory damages to the plain­tiffs’; and (5) ‘awarding exemplary
damages.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the contract of carriage, the testimony of
the prin­cipal teacher Filoteo de los Reyes sufficiently establishes the exist­ence
of such contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appel­lants have
not introduced evidence to dispute the fact that de los Reyes entered into a
contract for the bus to make the trip to Bunguiao, and that he paid for it,
Neither have they contradicted Marcos' affidavit (exh. C-28) to the effect that
he was authorized by the manager of the Zamtranco to make the trip in quest­ion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This being a case of violation of a contract of carriage
resulting in death to passengers, the presumption is that the appellants as
carriers have been at fault or have acted neg­ligently (art. 1756, new Civil
Code; Sy vs. Malate Taxicab, L-8937, Nov. 29, 1957).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This presumption can, how­ever, be rebutted
by (1) proof of ex­traordinary diligence or (2) proof that the accident was due
to a fortui­tous event.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the first possible defense, the appellants
have not even as much as hinted either at the trial or in this appeal that they
had exer­cised the diligence required of them as carriers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All they did was to deny that the driver was
authorized to ope­rate the vehicle in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to the second, we note that only the dri­ver has interposed
fortuitous event below, but as we have already noted, his appeal has been
dismissed, and as to him, the decision <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> had already become
final and executory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent his second
defense, the appellants have raised this belatedly, as they did it only on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At all events, the occurrence of
fortuitous event is belied by the report of investigation (exh. c) to the
effect that the driver was under the influence of liquor, and that the bus was
running at a fast clip in-spite of the fact that the road was slippery.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is undisputed that Josefina was 32 years old at the time
she died and a public school teacher receiving P120 a month or P1,440 a year,
with the pros­pect of increase in salary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proba­bilities that she would live until she reached the compulsory
retirement age of 65 cannot be discounted for there is no evidence that she was
suffering from any sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
likewise no dis­pute that her husband Ramon was 27 years old at the time of his
death, a far­mer by calling and in good health.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these have been established, and the appellants have not presented
re­buttal evidence (t.s.n. 60, <u>id</u>.) Al­lowing him a minimum income of
P120 a month, he was earning at least P1,440 a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probabilities of advancement are also not
remote as he was still young.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x The manner with which the driver operated the vehicle as des­cribed
in exh. C, and appellants' ab­solute lack of precaution in assigning the driver
to this particularly dangerous night trip notwithstanding the driver's record
of previous traf­fic violations (exh. C-47), are so reprehensible as to call
for the imposition of large exemplary damages to serve as a deterrent to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To us, the amount of P5,000 could serve the
purpose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, with the modification that the following damages
are hereby awarded, to wit, (1) P12,000 for the death of the spouses Ramon and
Josefina Dagamanuel, (2) P11,520 for the loss of earnings of both spouses, (3)
P5,000 as moral damages, and (4) P5,000 as exemplary damages, the judg­ment <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> is affirmed in all other respects, at defendants-appellants'
cost."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due time petitioners-appellants moved for the reconsideration
of the above-quoted judgment of the Court of Appeals, but the same was denied;
hence, this appeal via the present petition for certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now contend that the Court of Appeals committed the
following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE COURT OF
APPEALS ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW AND APPLICABLE DECI­SIONS OF THE SUPREME
COURT, IN HOLD ING PETITIONER ZAMTRANCO, THE UNREGISTERED OWNER OF THE
ILL-FATED VEHICLE, JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE WITH THE ZAMBRACO, THE RE­GISTERED
OWNER, AND WITH THE DRI­VER THEREOF.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE COURT OF
APPEALS ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT
IN (A) AWARDING EXCESSIVE DAMAGES FOR THE DEATH OF THE PARENTS OF RESPOND­ENT
DAGAMANUEL; EXCESSIVE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES; AND EXCESSIVE MORAL DAMAGES TO
RESPONDENT, WITHOUT THE LATTER APPEALING THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT, AND
(B) IN HOLDING PETITIONERS JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE WITH THE DRIVER BY WAY
OF EXEMPLARY DAMAGES FOR THE LATTER'S WRONGFUL ACT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That the Court of Appeals did not commit the first error assigned
by appellants is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is
true that according to previous decisions of this Court, a transfer f a
certificate of public convenience to ope­rate a transportation service is not
effective and binding insofar as the responsibility of the grantee under, the franchise
in its relation to the public is concerned, without the approval of the
transfer by the Public Service Commission required by the Public Service Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and that in contemplation of law, the transferor of such certificate continues
to be the operator of the service as long as the transfer is not yet approved,
and as such operator, he is the one responsible jointly and severally with his
driver for damages incurred by passengers for third persons in consequence of
injuries or deaths resulting from the operation of such service,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
We do not find any need for applying these rulings to the present petitioners
for the simple reason that in their respective third-party complaints, as noted
by the Court of Appeals they both admitted separately that they are the owners
of the bus involved in the incident in question and that Valeriano Marcos, the
driver of said bus at the time of said incident, was in their employ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is nothing strange in this because,
as found by said appellate court;</p>

<blockquote>"There is abundant evidence that although the Zambraco appears
to be the registered owner, Zamtranco was in fact the operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, there is the testimony of
Filoteo de los Reyes, principal teacher of Jose­fina, to the effect that for
the trip to and from Bunguiao where the benefit dance was held, he contracted
with Zamtranco at Tetuan (t.s.n. 13-14, Aug. 7, 1956, Cabato); that he saw in
Bunguiao the bus sent by Zamtranco (t.s.n. 33, <u>id</u>.); and that he paid
the fare to the driver of Zamtranco (t.s.n. 21 <u>id</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony was never contradicted by the
appellants, either by documentary or testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their own brief in this instance, appellants make these
significant admissions:</p>

<blockquote>"The facts that TPU Bus No. 11327 which figured in the accident
that caused the death of the spouses Ra­mon Dagamanuel and Josefina Punzalan
was registered in the name of Zam­braco in the year 1955, is not dis­puted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the sale and merger of this
Zambraco with the Zam­tranco was to be the subject of appli­cation with the
Public Service Com­mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending such
approval, the ill-fated bus was again registered in the name of the Zambraco in
the year 1956, according to the testimony given at the trial by Leonardo Gal­vez,
then Acting Registrar of the Motor Vehicle Office in Zamboanga."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, under these circumstances, We cannot find any reason to
disagree with Mr. Justice Fred Ruiz Castro who penned the appealed decision in
his ruling to the effect that:</p>

<blockquote>"We do not find any application of the ruling in the foregoing
cases to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, the
registered owners invariably sought to pass on liability to the actual ope­rators
on the pretext that they had already sold or transferred their units to the
latter, whereas in the present case, the registered owner, the Zambraco, admits
whatever lia­bility it has and vigorously objects to any finding that the
actual opera­tor, the Zamtranco, is also liable with it, claiming that as
registered owner, it alone should be adjudged liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would not inquire into the motive of the
Zambraco why in­stead of sharing whatever liability it has with the Zamtranco,
it prefers to shoulder it alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
fact stands out in bold relief that al­though still the registered owner at the
time of the accident, it had al­ready sold the vehicle to Zamtranco and the
latter was actually operat­ing it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is our view that it is for the better protection of the
public that both the owner of record and the actual operator, as held by us in
the past, should be adjudged jointly and severally liable with the driver (see
Dizon vs. Octavio, et al., 51 O.G. No. 8, 4059-4061; Castanares vs. Pages,
CA-G.R. 21809-R, March 8, 1962; Redado vs. Bautis­ta, CA-G.R. 19295-R, Sept.
19, 1961; Bering vs. Noeth, CA-G.R. 28483-R, April 29, 1965)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second assignment of error refers to the dif­ferent items of
damages awarded by the respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners complain that the same are excessive if not without legal
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To a certain extent, petitioners
are right.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be recalled that the trial court's judgment regarding the
matter of damages was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P8,000.00
for the death of Ramon Dagamanuel;</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Costs."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment, only petitioners appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pri­vate respondents did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, petition­ers are correct in
inviting Our attention thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The respondent did not appeal any portion of the decision of
the lower Court, thus indicating that he is fully satisfied with the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the driver of the
ill-fated bus failed to perfect his ap­peal and consequently, as against him,
the decision of the lower Court is already final.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The lower Court rendered a deci­sion against the driver of
the bus and the two petitioners herein for the death of the parents of the re­spondent
in the sum of P16,000.00, together with P4,000.00 exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But notwithstanding the automatic exclusion
of the driver from the effects of the appealed decision, the Court of Appeals,
while reducing the death award to P12,000.00 increased the exemplary damages to
P5,000.00 adding thereto P11,520.00 compensatory damages and P5,000.00 moral
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We humbly contend that to award
damages when none was allowed by the lower Court, and to increase damages when
the successful party did not appeal, is simply im­proper and amounts to pure
abuse of discretion on the part of the respond­ent appellate Court, contrary to
the doctrines laid down by the Honorable Supreme Court in the following cases,
to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'<u>The discretion in fixing moral and exemplary damages primarily
lay in the trial court and the same should be respected</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Coleongco vs. Claparols, No. L-18616, <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>; Emphasis ours).'</p>

<p class="2Q">'It is well-settled rule in this jurisdiction that whenever an
appeal is taken in a civil case, <u>an appellee who has not himself appealed
cannot obtain from the appellate court any affirmative relief other than the
ones granted in the deci­sion of the court below.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appellee, who is not appellant, may assign
errors in his brief where his purpose is to main­tain the judgment on other
grounds, but he may not do so if his purpose is to have the judgment modified
or reversed, for, in such a case, he must appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>HERE, THE RESPONDENT DID NOT APPEAL AND SO IT
WAS ERROR FOR THE COURT OF APPEALS TO AWARD HIM A RELIEF NOT GRANTED BY THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street>." (Dy, et al. vs. Kuison, L-16654 Nov.
30, 1961; Emphasis ours).'</p>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, it is respectfully sub­mitted, that a child
3-year old, as the respondent herein was when his parents died, cannot yet feel
the mental anguish resulting from their death, as to warrant such excessive
award of P5,000.00 moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
venture to ask, therefore, what degree of mental torture could have been possibly
endured by a boy of such tender age?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe that the measure of moral damages, if any, must be com­mensurate with
the mental anguish suf­fered by the heir.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">True it is, the awards of P8,000 each for the death of the
parents of respondent Jose Mario Dagamanuel may not be increased anymore, but
We cannot say that they should be reduced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Quite, on the contrary, We consider the judgment of the Court of Appeals
in respect to the matter of damages to be more in accordance with the facts,
except perhaps, as to the item of moral damages, considering the tender age of
the above-named respondent child, and We would have upheld the same had private
respondent appealed from the decision of the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the Court of Appeals properly interpreted the P16,000 awarded by the
trial court as including not only damages for the death of the deceased couple
but also the other items of recoverable damages, like compensatory or act­ual,
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus viewed, the amounts awarded by
the trial court cannot be considered excessive.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the Court of

On the question of damages, this is what the Court of Appeals held:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"The trial court awarded P8,000
for the death of Ramon Dagamanuel and P8,000 for the death of his wife
Josefina, and P4,000 as exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"Surely, in fixing P8,000
‘for the death' of each of the spouses, the trial court could not have meant
that the amount is not all-embracing as not to include actual or com­pensatory
damages, moral damages and damages for loss of earning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To assume otherwise is to say that the trial
court was not aware of the provisions of Articles 1764 and 2206 of the new
Civil Code regarding damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in
awarding P8,000 ‘for the death' of each of the spouses the trial court meant to
include actual and moral damages and damages for loss of earning, is obvious,
for the plaintiff has asked for the various items in his com­plaint separately
and distinctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Embrasing as it does the
three classes of damages enumerated above, the sum of P8,000 awarded by the
trial court is unconscionable.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"The applicable provisions of
the new Civil Code are hereunder quoted:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 58.5pt; text-indent: 13.5pt;">'ART.
1764.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Damages in cases com­prised in
this Section shall be awarded in accordance with Title VIII of this Book
concerning Damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2206 shall
also apply to the death of a passenger caused by the breach of contract by a
common carrier.'</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 58.5pt; text-indent: 13.5pt;">'ART.
2206.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount of damages for death
caused by a crime or quasi-delict shall be at least three thousand pesos, even
though there may have been mitigating circumstances in add­ition:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 58.5pt; text-indent: 13.5pt;">‘(1) The
defendant shall be liable for the loss of the earn­ing capacity of the
deceased, and the indemnity shall be paid to the heirs of the latter; such
indemnity shall in every case be assessed and awarded by the court, unless the
deceased on account of permanent physical disability not caused by the
defendant, had no earning capacity at the time of his death; </p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 58.5pt; text-indent: 13.5pt;">‘(2) If the
deceased was ob­liged to give support according to the provisions of Article
291, the recipient who is not an heir called to the decedent's inhe­ritance by
the law of testate or intestate succession, may demand support from the person
causing the death, for a period not ex­ceeding five years, the exact dura­tion
to be fixed by the court.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 58.5pt; text-indent: 13.5pt;">‘(3) The
spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants and ascendants of the deceased may
demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death of the
deceased.'</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"As the law itself provides,
the amount of damages for death is 'at least three thousand pesos'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uniform jurisprudence has increased it to
P6,000 (Corona <i>vs</i>. Pambusco, CA-G.R. 16393-R, July 30, 1957; Monserat,
et al. <i>vs</i>. M. Ruiz Highway Transit, CA-G.R. 17416-­R, July 27, 1959 and
cases therein cited; Dailisan <i>vs</i>. Co Eng Go, CA-G.R. 16021-R, Oct. 8,
1963).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff is therefore
entitled for the death of his parents, to P6,000 each, or P12,000 for
both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this amount must be added two
other items of damages, to wit, actual or compensatory (No. 1) and moral
damages (No. 3) (see Mercado <i>vs</i>. Lira, L-13328-29, L-13358, <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="9">Sept. 29, 1961</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"It is undisputed that
Josefina was 32 years old at the time she died and a public school teacher
receiving P120 a month or P1,440 a year, with the prospect of increases in
salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probabilities that she would
live until she reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 cannot be discounted
for there is no evidence that she was suffering from any sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is likewise no dispute that her husband
Ramon was 27 years old at the time of his death, a farmer by calling and in
good health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these have been
established, and the appellants have not presented re­buttal evidence (t.s.n.
60, id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allow­ing him a minimum income
of P120 a month, he was earning at least P1,440 a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probabilities of advancement are also not
remote as he was still young.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"For compensatory damages,
Josefina and Ramon should have earned within a pe­riod of four years, in
accordance with settled jurisprudence (Alcantara <i>vs</i>. Curro, et al. 49 O.
G. No. 7, 2769; Heirs of Tirso Cura <i>vs</i>. Meralco, CA-G.R. 18221-R, Feb.
14, 1958; Lira <i>vs</i>. Mercado, CA-G.R. 15422-R-23-R, July 11, 1957; Ybañez <i>vs</i>.
North Negros Sugar Co., CA-G.R. 26608-R, Oct. 14, 1963), a minimum of P5,760
each, or a total of P11,520 for both.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"Another item recoverable by
the plain­tiff is moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Decidedly, under par. (3) of Article 2206, the plaintiff is entitled to
a certain amount for his mental anguish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that at the time his parents died and until the present, he
is still a minor, the sum of P5,000 is reason­able (see Necessito <i>vs</i>. Paras,
L-10605-06, resolution on motion for reconsideration, Sept. 11, 1958; Mercado <i>vs</i>.
Lira, <i>supra</i>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award of
exemplary damages is justified under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manner with which the driver operated the
vehicle as described in Exh. C, and appellants' ab­solute lack of precaution in
assigning the driver to this particularly dangerous night trip notwithstanding
the driver's record of previous traffic violations (Exh. C-47), are so
reprehensible as to call for the im­position of large exemplary damages to
serve as a deterrent to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To us,
the amount of P5,000.00 could serve the purpose."</p>
