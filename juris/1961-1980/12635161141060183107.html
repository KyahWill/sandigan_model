				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners spouses and private respondent <span class="SpellE">Olimpio</span>
Mendoza were plaintiffs and defendant, respectively, in a civil case before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bula­can</span> for quieting of
title to certain properties consist­ing of logs, lumber, a sawmill and its
accessories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the
litigation, the parties entered into an amicable settlement wherein respondent
recognized pe­titioners' ownership of <span class="GramE">the sawmill</span>,
while the latter recognized the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> right over
all the sawed logs and lumber subject of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amicable settlement also provided, in
par. 4 thereof<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> -</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as a further condition of this agreement,
plaintiffs have agreed, as they hereby agree, <u>to pay to the defendant</u>
the sum of THREE THOUSAND (P3,000.00) PESOS, Philip­pine Currency, in
consideration of the mutual quit-claim, which amount the herein defendant
assigns to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>,
as represen­ted In this agreement by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimalanta</span>, his representatives" (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon its submission, the lower court on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1964</st1:date> rendered a decision
approving the amicable settlement and enjoining the parties to comply with the
terms and conditions thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1964</st1:date>;
respondent filed a motion be fore the lower court for a writ of execution to
enforce payment to him of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> by petitioners
pursuant to par. 4 of the amicable settlement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was alleged by respondent that while the judgment based on said
settlement had already become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, petitioners
still have not yet paid the said P3,000.00 and that <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> had, on this same date, filed a written
waiver of his right to the assignment of said sum.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1964</st1:date>, granted respondent's Motion and ordered the issuance of a
writ of execution which was issued on the very same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="11">November
 23, 1964</st1:date>, petitioners filed a motion to reconsider the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1964</st1:date>, and also an
opposition to the wai­ver of the assignment executed and filed by <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, The lower court denied both motion and opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1964</st1:date>,
the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Bula­can</span> levied upon two
(2) lots and a house built thereon owned by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of levy was filed and regis­tered with
the local Register of Deeds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the sheriff issued the "Notice of Sale" setting
the sale on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1965</st1:date>
and on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1964</st1:date>
served a co­py of said notice to petitioners by registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the sale, the levied properties were
acquired by respondent for P3<span class="GramE">,269.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of sale was then de­livered
to respondent's counsel and registered with the Register of Deeds on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1965</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1966</st1:date>,
respondent filed an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> mo­tion for an alias
writ of possession to place him in actual possession of the properties in
question. The court granted the motion and the alias writ was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1966</st1:date>, petitioners filed an urgent motion to quash said alias
writ of possession. This was denied and peti­tioners filed an amended motion to
quash.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1966</st1:date>,
the lower court denied petitioner's amended motion to quash and issued,
instead, a second alias writ of possession as prayed for in respondent's ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion of <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="7">July
 11, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
petitioners instituted the instant petition for certiorari with preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gave due course thereto
and is sued preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three questions are presented for determination:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Are petitioners entitled to prior notice and
hearing before the trial court can order execution of a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment?</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Was the writ of execution issued, substantially
at variance with the judgment of the lower court rendered on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1964</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Was the manner of levy by the provincial sheriff
attended with irregularity?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the first point, it is by now axiomatic that a judgment
on a compromise - like the one in the case at bar - is at once final and
immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also of the same stature is the rule that
once a judgment be­comes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the
prevailing party can have it executed as a <u>matter of right</u> and the
granting of exe­cution becomes a <u>ministerial duty</u> of the <span class="GramE">court.</span> Otherwise stated, once sought by the prevailing
party, execution of a final judgment will just follow <u>as a matter of course</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the judgment debtor need not be given
advance no­tice of the application for execution nor be afforded prior hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This renders of little significance then the fact alleged by petitioners that
they received copy of res­pondent's motion for execution only on the afternoon
of the day set for its hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second point, petitioners' claim that variance obtains
because under par. 4 of the amicable settlement their obligation to pay the P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is in favor of <span class="SpellE">Deme­trio</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> and not to respondent is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cited paragraph very clearly states that
"as a further condition x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<u>plaintiffs</u> [herein petitioners] <u>have agreed</u>, <u>as they hereby
agree</u>, <u>to pay to the defendant</u> [herein respondent] <u>the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000</span></u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
The matter of the assignment of this amount <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>
is purely bet­ween him and respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is an <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> fact that
petitioners have not made any payment: to anyone and that <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>
had already waived all his rights under the assignment back to respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court therefore neither abused its
discretion nor acted in excess of or without jurisdiction in ordering execution
of the judgment for P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in respondent's favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners finally argue that they had not been served a notice
of the levy <span class="GramE">nor</span> a notice of the sale as required by
the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff's return,
however, shows that the notice of levy had been registered with the Register of
Deeds pursuant to Rule 57, Sec. 7 in Con­nection with Rule 39, Sec. 15 of the
Rules, and that the notice of sale had been sent by registered mail on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12">Decem­ber 28, 1964</st1:date>, to
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming then that
petitioners were not served a copy of the notice of levy, yet <span class="GramE">We</span> have already ruled in <u>Philippine Bank of Commerce V. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span></u>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-14174, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 31, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, that this defect is cured by service of notice of sale upon the
judgment debtors prior to the sale, which was cone here.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The levy was validly <span class="GramE">effected</span>
then.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for lack of merit, the petition is hereby
dismissed and writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued revoked and set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against
peti­tioners.</span></p>
