				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by the Republic of the Philippines from the order of
the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 21127 dated October 12,
1962 dismissing its petition to declare null and void the final decision
rendered there­in and to cancel the certificate of naturalization issued to <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> Huang (<span class="SpellE">Uy</span>) in accordance
therewith, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction because the publication of the
notice of hearing on the petition for naturalization in the official gazette was
made only once.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted that on November 2, 1953, <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
Huang (<span class="SpellE">Uy</span>) filed a petition for naturalization with
the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 21127).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 6 of the same year, the court
ordered that the corresponding notice of hearing be published once a week for
three con­secutive weeks <span style="">in </span>the
Official Gazette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said notice was
actually published only once <span style="">in </span>the
Official Gazette in its No. 11, Vol. 49 monthly issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the court rendered its decision
admitting <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to Philippine citizenship, and
after the same had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and due
<span style="">hearing </span>was had, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> took his oath of allegiance on <u>September 1,
1956</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>present
petition for cancellation of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> certificate
of naturalization was filed on May 10, 1962, the State relying on our ruling in
<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Son Cui vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-9858, May 29,
1957, to the effect that one publication in the official gazette was
insufficient to confer jurisdiction to the court a quo to try <span style="">and </span>decide the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><b>IN VIEW</b> of our recent ruling in the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gan</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Tsitung</span> </span>case
(G. R. No.</span> L-20819) to the effect that "the doctrine laid down in
the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Son Cui case shall apply and affect the
validity of certificates of naturalization issued after, not on or before, May
29, 1957" and that "certificates of naturalization issued on or
before May 29, 1957, even if notice of the petition for naturalization had been
published once only x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
should not be nullified", We find the order appealed from to be in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
same is hereby affirmed, without costs.</p>
