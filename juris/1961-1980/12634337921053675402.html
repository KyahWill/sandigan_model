case, and to order the respondent Judge to admit him as <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated Mining Company
(hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>) filed on
September 27, 1974 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Branch XIII a complaint with a plea for preliminary mandatory injunction

docketed as Civil Case No. 20046 seeking the following relief:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> also sought payment of interest
on delayed loan amounts, exemplary damages of at least P500,000.00, attorney's
fees and other litigation expenses, and other cumulative and/or alternative <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> as may be lawful, just or equitable in the
premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The civil suit thus instituted by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
against Malayan was founded on the fact that on <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="9">Sept. 9, 1971</st1:date>, Malayan issued Marine Open Policy No.
LIDC-MOP-001/71 covering all shipments of copper, gold and silver concentrates
in bulk from <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>, San Fernando, La Union to Tacoma,
Washington or to other places in the United States which <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
may make on and after August 1, 1971 and until the cancellation of the policy
upon thirty (30) days' written notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Malayan obtained reinsurance abroad through Sedgwick,
Collins &amp; Co., Limited, a <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>
insurance brokerage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Memorandum of
Insurance issued by Sedgwick to Malayan on <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1971</st1:date> listed three groups of underwriters or <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> and their reinsurance interest are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Lloyds<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>62.808%</blockquote>

<blockquote>100.000%</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the top of the list of underwriting members of Lloyds is
Syndicate No. 448, assuming 2.48% of the risk assumed by the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span>, which syndicate number peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span> Robert Dayton Gibson claims to be himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">In November, 1971, a cargo of concentrates was shipped by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> on the M/V Hermosa at <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union destined for
<st1:place><st1:city>Tacoma</st1:city>, <st1:state>Washington</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the sea voyage, while the vessel was
in the Northern Pacific Ocean south of Japan on or about Nov. 11, 1971, it
encountered heavy weather and rough seas which caused it to roll, pitch and
vibrate heavily so that certain shifting boards in the vessel broke and part of
the cargo shifted transversely, thereby causing a list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vessel deviated to Moji, Japan and after
the shifting boards were repaired and/or replaced, it proceeded on its trip to
Tacoma, but about the end of the month, the ship once again met with strong
winds, monsoon rains, severe winter and very rough seas and it rolled, pitched
and vibrated heavily so other shifting boards broke and part of the cargo also
shifted causing a heavier list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
captain of the boat, fearing that the vessel might sink, sailed to <st1:city><st1:place>Osaka</st1:place></st1:city>
and unloaded the cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Expenses were
incurred by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> relative to the cargo while in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
but eventually the cargo was <span class="SpellE">transhipped</span> to <st1:city><st1:place>Tacoma</st1:place></st1:city>
via another vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also in November, 1971, another cargo of concentrates was shipped
by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> on board the M/V General <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> at <span class="SpellE">Poro</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union and destined for <st1:place><st1:city>Tacoma</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>Washington</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, during the sea voyage on or about <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1971</st1:date> in the <st1:place>Northern
 Pacific Ocean</st1:place> southeast of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
it met with heavy weather and rough seas, causing it to pitch, roll and vibrate
heavily so that certain shifting boards in the vessel broke and part of the
cargo shifted transversely which caused the listing of the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The captain, fearing also that the vessel
might sink, sailed for <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Miyako</span></st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Japan</st1:country-region></st1:place>, unloaded the cargo
and expenses were incurred relative to the cargo while in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the cargo was <span class="SpellE">transhipped</span>
to <st1:city><st1:place>Tacoma</st1:place></st1:city> on board another vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> notified Malayan and another
insurer, Commercial Union in <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>
in November and December, 1971 of the accidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Formal claims under the open policy were also
filed by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> with Malayan in March and July, 1972
upon the conclusion of the voyages and the determination of the <span class="SpellE">shortweight</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claims were denied by Malayan tentatively at first claiming
that it needed time to determine whether or not the marine accidents resulted
from the inherent vice or nature of the cargo and finally Malayan rejected <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> insurance claim for the reason that the cargoes
were inherently vicious on loading and such condition caused the listing of the
vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
against Malayan in Civil Case No. 20046 for the interest-free loan to <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> as stipulated in the policy computed at
P1,831.695.75.</p>

<p class="BODY">Malayan filed a motion to dismiss the case on three grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1. that the instant case has been brought in
the name of other than the real party in interest; 2. that the complaint states
no cause of action; and 3. that the claim set forth in the complaint has been
extinguished.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1974</st1:date>,
Malayan's motion to dismiss was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1975</st1:date>,
Malayan filed its Answer incorporating as part of its special and affirmative
defenses the following allegations:</p>

<blockquote>"(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant acted in good faith in rejecting
plaintiff's insurance claims, not only because of the circumstances and reasons
set forth in the preceding sub-paragraphs (1) to (4) which defendant had been
reasonably led to believe by reports of reputed experts and/or by legal advice
as justifying rejection, but also because, as plaintiff had been repeatedly
told, it is under constraint, on one hand, by customs of the insurance trade to
adhere to the decisions of the lead insurers, and on another hand, by its
contract with its <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> which among others,
prohibit settlement of the reinsured claims without the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer's</span>
assent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1975</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> filed its reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1975</st1:date>, the Court denied <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span>
motion for mandatory preliminary injunction "without prejudice to
reconsider the said motion after the pre-trial of this case shall have been
concluded." On <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1975</st1:date>,
the first pre-trial conference was held and on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1975</st1:date>, the parties filed their Stipulation of
Facts and Issues, which Stipulations was approved <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
in the trial court's order of <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="4">April 1,
 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, pre-trial conferences were held on <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1975</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1975</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1975</st1:date> when <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
concluded its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
through coun­sel reserved its right to make a formal offer of its evidence at
the continuation of the hearing scheduled on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span> Robert Dayton Gibson filed a motion

<p class="BODY">Counsel for the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> submitted the

<p class="BODY">Replying to <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> opposition, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span> Robert Dayton Gibson
contended that 1. Contrary to <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> contention,
<span class="SpellE">movant</span> Gibson has a legal interest in the matter in
litigation because a contract of reinsurance between the defendant Malayan
Insurance Company, Inc. and the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> herein is a
contract of indemnity against liability, and not merely against damage, and
therefore, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> has a direct and immediate interest
in the success of defendant Malayan Insurance Company, Inc.; 2. Neither <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> nor <span class="SpellE">laches</span> applies to
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> since the motion to intervene was filed
seasonably on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1975</st1:date>
during the period of introduction of evidence by defendant Malayan; 3. The
intervention is not intended for delay; <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is
merely asserting a legal right or interest in the pending case with the request
for opportunity to appear and be joined so that he could protect or assert such
right or interest; and 4. The filing of an independent and separate suit
proposed by the plaintiff is condemned by the basic and fundamental principles
against multiplicity of suits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1975</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> filed a Rejoinder to the <span class="SpellE">movant's</span>
"Reply to Opposition." On <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="7">July

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1975</st1:date>,

has presented before this Court a motion to intervene on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his motion, he alleges that he is a British citizen with address at

EC3; that he is the leading re-insurer of the risks and liabilities assumed by
defendant Malayan Insurance Company, Inc. in the contract of marine insurance
involving the shipments subject of the instant suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further contends that he has a legal interest
in the subject matter of litigation for he stands liable on his re-insurance
contract should judgment be rendered against the defendant and that this
intervention would avoid a multiplicity of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff vigorously opposed the motion
contending that <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span>
Robert Dayton Gibson has no legal interest in the matter in litigation or in
the success of either parties in this suit; that he is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; that the intervention is intended for
delay and will unduly delay the proceedings between plaintiff and defendant;
and that <span class="SpellE">movant</span> will not be prejudiced by the present
suit and can be fully protected in any separate action which defendant may file
against him and his co-insurers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering the grounds of the opposition, the Court believes that
the third and fourth grounds raised in the opposition appear highly
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ivor</span> Robert Dayton Gibson appears to be only one of
several re-insurers of the risks and liabilities assumed by Malayan Insurance
Company, Inc., it is highly probable that other re-insurers may likewise
intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would definitely disrupt
the trial between plaintiff and defendant, the principal protagonists in this
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow the intervention would
certainly unduly delay the proceedings between plaintiff and defendant
especially at this stage where plaintiff had already rested its case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would also compound the issues as more
parties and more matters will have to be litigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span>
Robert Dayton Gibson may protect whatever interest he has in a separate action.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We lay down the law on Intervention as found in Sec. 2, Rule 12
of the Rules of Court:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A person may,
before or during a trial, be permitted by the court, in its discretion, to
intervene in an action, if he has legal interest in the matter in litigation,
or in the success of either of the parties or an interest against both, or when
he is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition
of property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(a)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Motion for intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A person desiring to intervene shall file a
motion for leave of court with notice upon all the parties to the action.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(b)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Discretion of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In allowing or disallowing a motion for
intervention, the court, in the exercise of discretion, shall consider whether
or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the
rights of the original parties and whether or not the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span>
rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(c)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Complaint or answer in intervention. - The
intervention shall be made by complaint filed and served in a regular form, and
may be answered as if it were an original complaint; but where <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> unites with the defendant in resisting the
claims of the plaintiff, the intervention may be made in the form of an answer
to the complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(d)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Time. - Unless a different period is fixed by
the court, the complaint or answer in intervention shall be filed within ten (10)
days from notice of the order permitting such intervention."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to pertinent jurisprudence, the term
"intervention" refers to the proceeding by which one not originally a
party to an action is permitted, on his own application, to appear therein and
join one of the original parties in maintaining the action or defense, or to
assert a claim or defense against some or all of the parties to the proceeding
as originally instituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a third
party may, upon the discretion of the court, become a party to a pending
proceedings between others for the protection of some rights or interest
alleged by him to be affected by such proceedings.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Intervention is not a matter of absolute right but may be
permitted by the court when the applicant shows facts which satisfy the
requirements of the statute authorizing intervention.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Under our Rules of Court, what qualifies a person to intervene is his
possession of a legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success
of either of the parties, or an interest against both; or when he is so
situated as to be adversely a-<span class="SpellE">fected</span> by a distribution
or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or <span class="SpellE">or</span> an officer thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
As regards the legal interest as qualifying factor, this Court has ruled that
such interest must be of a direct and immediate character so that the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> will either gain or lose by the direct legal
operation of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interest
must be actual and material, a concern which is more than mere curiosity, or
academic or sentimental desire; it must not be indirect and contingent,
indirect and remote, conjectural, consequential or collateral.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
However, notwithstanding the presence of a legal interest, permission to
intervene is subject to the sound discretion of the court, the exercise of
which is limited by considering "whether or not the intervention will
unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original
parties and whether or not the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> rights
may be fully protected in a separate proceeding."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Once judicial discretion is exercised, the action of the court cannot be
reviewed or controlled by <i>mandamus</i> however erroneous it may be, except
only when there is an arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion, in which
case, the fault is correctible by <i>mandamus</i> if there be no other adequate
and speedy remedy.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As may be noted in the questioned Order, respondent Judge denied
the Motion to Intervene on the last two grounds of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span>
Opposition, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"3. The intervention
is intended for delay and if allowed, will unduly delay the proceedings between
plaintiff and defendant; and 4. The rights, if any, of <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
are not prejudiced by the present suit and will be fully protected in a
separate action against him and his co-insurers by defendant herein."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge, reasoning out his Order, ruled that "(s)<span class="SpellE">ince</span> <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span>
Robert Dayton Gibson appears to be only one of several co-insurers of the risks
and liabilities assumed by Malayan Insurance Company, Inc., it is highly
probable that other re-insurers may likewise intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would definitely disrupt the trial
between plaintiff and defendant, the principal protagonists in this suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow the intervention would certainly
unduly delay the proceedings between plaintiff and defendant especially at this
stage where plaintiff had already rested its case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would also compound the issues as more
parties and more matters will have to be litigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span>
Robert Dayton Gibson may protect whatever interest he has in a separate
action."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition, petitioner submits that the respondent Judge, in
refusing to permit/allow him to intervene in Civil Case No. 20046, incorrectly
interpreted and/or appreciated the purpose/intent of the pertinent rules of
procedure that govern intervention of parties in a given action and that the
respondent Judge erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) In
concluding that to allow the intervention of herein petitioner "would
definitely disrupt the trial" and "would certainly unduly delay the
proceedings," when such apprehension appears to be clearly immaterial in
determining when intervention is proper or not; (2) In viewing the alleged
availability of another recourse on the part of herein petitioner to protect
his interest, i.e. separate action, as an added justification to deny his intervention,
despite the fact that the applicable rule of procedure in this regard (Section
2, Rule 12) does not preclude intervention even if another separate action is
appropriate and/or available; and (3) In its obvious disregard of the very rule
(Section 2, Rule 12) precisely designed to apply on cases where intervention is
sought, thereby departing from the accepted and usual procedure under the
premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully considering the arguments of both the petitioner
and <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, the facts and circumstances obtaining in
the case at bar and applying Rule 12, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Court and the
doctrines enunciated by the Supreme Court on the matter, We rule that the
respondent Judge committed no error of law in denying petitioner's Motion to
Intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And neither has he abused his
discretion in his denial of petitioner's Motion for Intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite crystal clear that the questioned Order of the
respondent Court was based strictly and squarely on Section 2(b) of Rule 12
which specifically directs the Court in allowing or disallowing a motion for
intervention in the exercise of discretion to consider whether or not the
intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of
the original parties and whether or not the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span>
rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court <u>a quo</u> has specifically and
correctly complied with the Rule's mandate and We cannot fault the respondent
Judge <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reject the contention of the petitioner that the question
regarding delay in the adjudication of the rights of the original contending
parties, while recognized as factors in allowing or disallowing intervention,
should assume a secondary role to the primary and imperative requirement that
the legal interest of the would-be <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in the
matter under litigation must be clearly shown and that once the legal interest
of the would be <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> is clearly shown, the fact
that his intervention may work to delay a little the main conflict between the
parties should not by itself justify the denial of intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first paragraph of Section 2, Rule 12
prescribes the time to intervene and also who may intervene, that is, one who
has legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of
the parties or an interest against both or when he is so situated as to be
adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the
custody of the court or of an officer thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph (b) of the same section directs what matters are to be
considered in exercising discretion to allow or disallow a motion for
intervention, which are whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or
prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties and whether or
not the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> rights may be fully protected in
a separate proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, for the
Court to permit intervention, it must be shown that <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
is possessed of legal interest in the matter in litigation or otherwise
qualified under the first paragraph of Section 2, and the Court must also
consider the matters mentioned in paragraph (b) thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter are not and should not be taken as
secondary to the former for both must concur since they are equally important,
requisite and necessary for consideration in the exercise of discretion by the
Court to allow or disallow intervention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot invest nor render primary or secondary importance to either of
these requirements for the law does not make any distinction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each case must be decided according to its
facts and merits, subject to the discretion of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the particular facts and circumstances of the case at bar,
We are satisfied that the respondent Judge has not abused his discretion in
denying petitioner's Motion to Intervene.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with the holding of the respondent Court that since <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Ivor</span> Robert Dayton Gibson
appears to be only one of several re-insurers of the risks and liabilities
assumed by Malayan Insurance Company, Inc., it is highly probable that other
re-insurers may likewise intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record shows that aside from the petitioner there are sixty-three (63) other
syndicate members of Lloyds, the twenty-six (26) companies in the
"I.L.U." group holding a 34.705% reinsurance interest and the two (2)
"Other Companies" holding the balance of the reinsurances, as listed
in Annex "A", <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>-Rejoinder to <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> Rejoinder, pp. 136-138, Records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The high probability that these other
re-insurers like the petitioner herein may likewise intervene if the latter's
motion is granted is not an arbitrary assumption of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering petitioner's assertion that he
will have the opportunity to show, among others, that the losses and damages
purportedly sustained by <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> occurred not from
the perils of the seas but from perils of the ships; that <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
is not the real party in interest; that it has no cause of action; and, neither
has it complied with its obligations under the policy which makes the filing of
the complaint premature (p. 118, Records, Reply to Opposition) if petitioner is
allowed to intervene, We hold that there is good and sufficient basis for the
Court <u>a quo</u> to declare that the trial between <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
and Malayan would be definitely disrupted and would certainly unduly delay the
proceedings between the parties especially at the stage where <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> had already rested its case and that the issues
would also be compounded as more parties and more matters will have to be
litigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the Court's
discretion is justified and reasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also hold that respondent Judge committed no reversible error
in further sustaining the fourth ground of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span>
Opposition to the Motion to Intervene that the rights, if any, of petitioner
are not prejudiced by the present suit and will be fully protected in a
separate action against him and his co-insurers by Malayan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that his rights would not be fully protected
in a separate proceeding because "(a) decision in favor of <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, declaring Malayan liable on its insurance policies
would necessarily and injuriously affect the interests of petitioner, (which)
interest as a re-insurer of Malayan's risk is not only inchoate but material,
direct and immediate and for such interest to be in any manner prejudiced
without first giving petitioner a chance to be heard would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, a decision in favor of Malayan, recognizing it as
not liable under its insurance policies, could subject petitioner to the danger
of having to admit that Malayan had not breached its insurance contract with
the entity (Lloyds) of which petitioner is the leading syndicate member."
(Petitioner's Memorandum, p. 230, Records).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner also asserts that "by the very nature of a contract of
re-insurance and considering that the re-insurer is obliged 'to pay as may be
paid thereon' (referring to the original policies), although this is subject to
other stipulations and conditions of the reinsurance contract, it will serve
better the ends of justice if a full disclosure of all pertinent facts and
issues is made with the participation of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
at this trial where his interests have been and are already inevitably at
stake." (Petition, p. 18, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> insists that
petitioner will have his day in court and his rights can be fully protected in
a separate proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>, if it loses the case against Malayan, petitioner
cannot possibly be liable to Malayan for indemnity on the reinsurances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> wins,
then petitioner, the sixty-three (63) other syndicate members of Lloyds, the
twenty-six (26) companies in the "I.L.U." group holding a 34.705%
reinsurance interest and the two (2) "Other Companies" holding the balance
of the reinsurances are free either to pay Malayan or to resist Malayan and
thus force Malayan to sue in whatever country most of them, qualitatively and
not quantitatively, may be served with summons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that he has to pay once Malayan is
finally adjudged to pay <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> because of the very
nature of a contract of reinsurance and considering that the re-insurer is
obliged 'to pay as may be paid thereon' (referring to the original policies),
although this is subject to other stipulations and conditions of the
reinsurance contract, is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The general rule in the law of reinsurance is that the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> is entitled to avail itself of every defense
which the re-insured (which is Malayan) might urge in an action by the person
originally insured (which is <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Speci­fically, the rule is stated thus ?</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1238.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In an
action on a contract of reinsurance, as a general rule the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span>
is entitled to avail itself of every defense which the reinsured might urge in
an action by the person originally insured; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (48 C.J.S., p. 230)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same rule is stated otherwise in 44 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
2d, Sec. 1862, p. 793, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, where an action is brought against the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> by the reinsured, the former may assert any
defense that the latter might have made in an action on the policy of original
insurance." (Eagle Ins. Co. vs. Lafayette Ins. Co., 9 Ind. 443)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the effect of the clause "to pay as may be paid
thereon" contained in petitioner's re-insurance contract, <span class="SpellE">Arnould</span>, on the Law of Marine Insurance and Average, 13th
Ed., Vol. I, Section 327, p. 315, states the rule, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It has been decided that this clause does not preclude the
re-insurer from insisting upon proper proof that a loss strictly within the
terms of the original policy has taken place."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This clause does not enable the original underwriter to
recover from his re-insurer to an extent beyond the subscription of the
latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is significant and revealing that petitioner himself admits in
his Memorandum, p. 231, Records, that "(o)f course, petitioner, if finally
sued in <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>, (he) could avail
himself of remedies available to him." He adds that "such a
procedure, if not entirely time-consuming, would actually beg the issue on
hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner believes that his
defenses on the claims ventilated in the court <u>a quo</u> can be appreciated
only here; elsewhere in view of the peculiar circumstances surrounding <span class="SpellE">Lepanto's</span> claims the basic issue will be obfuscated and
perhaps even obliterated by arguments on procedural niceties." However,
such a procedural problem is no legal ground to compel allowance of and insist
on his intervention.</p>
