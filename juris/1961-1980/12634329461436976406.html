				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This application for the writ of habeas corpus was filed by Maria
Beltran and <span class="SpellE">Prudencia</span> Rivera on behalf of Anderson
Beltran and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Rivera, alleged to be
"actually imprisoned and arbitrarily restrained of their liberty" by
respondent Rolando Garcia, a Captain in the Philippine Constabulary, they being
taken to the military stockade of the 164th P.C. Company.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>The application likewise set forth the fact that no criminal complaint had
been filed against the aforesaid individuals and that they were not informed
either of any charge or charges lodged against them.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the plea was for the immediate restoration of their liberty and
discharge from confinement as their detention was "without any legal
authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On October 3, 1978, this Court issued the following resolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Court [issued] the writ of habeas
corpus returnable to this Court not later than Wednesday, October 11, 1978 and
to [set] the hearing of this case for Thursday, October 12, 1978 at 3:00

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1978</st1:date>,
a return was filed by Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P.
Mendoza.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It is worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As alleged in paragraph 3 of the Petition,
Anderson Beltran and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Rivera were, on
September 21, 1978, apprehended by Armed Forces Police Unit, U.S. Naval Base, <span class="SpellE">Subic</span> Bay, and were thereafter turned over and detained at
the INP Integrated Jail, <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> Metropolitan
District Command, <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City, pursuant to ASSO No.
4597 dated September 20, 1978, * * *; 2. Said Anderson Beltran was apprehended
and detained for the offenses of smuggling (violation of <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
3601 and 3602 of the Revised Tariff and Customs Code) through falsification of
public documents (violation of Art. 172 of the Revised Penal Code) which
offenses have the effect of undermining public order within the contemplation
of Section 3, General Order No. 60, dated June 24, 1977; 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Rivera has
already been released from detention on October 8, 1978 as shown in the
Certificate of Release dated October 6, 1978 * * *, while Anderson Beltran is
still under detention at the INP Integrated Jail, <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
Metropolitan District Command, at <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City for
criminal prosecution of the offenses aforementioned; 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imprisonment of Anderson Beltran is with
legal authority; hence, the filing of the instant petition for habeas corpus is
without legal basis."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="10">October
 12, 1978</st1:date>, the persons detained appeared before the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The release of <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Rivera from confinement was admitted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, as to him, the petition had become moot and academic.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> A
motion was filed on behalf of the other detained individual, Anderson Beltran,
for his provisional release on the personal recognizance of his counsel,
Attorney Buena B. <span class="SpellE">Zamar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a manifestation filed by respondent on <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1978</st1:date>, it was shown that
the detainee Beltran was charged with the offense of smuggling under the
Revised Tariff and Customs Code through falsification of public documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the plea was for the denial of
the motion for provisional release.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the memorandum of petitioners filed on <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1978</st1:date>, the detention of Anderson
Beltran was challenged, the genuineness and authenticity of the arrest and
seizure order being put in issue, with his counsel alleging that unfortunately
he was not in a position to supply the needed documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he did pray that respondent be
made to furnish certain documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
memorandum likewise sought the release of Anderson Beltran "from custody
of respondent in order to afford him the chance to save his hungry family of 7
children who are now in the brink of disastrous hunger and have to live under
mercy of good neighbors feeding them to survive."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court, in a resolution of November 7, sought the comment of the Solicitor
General on such request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did so on <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, refuting the
allegations of petitioners' counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That aspect of the case need not be further inquired into, however, in
view of this development.</p>

<p class="BODY">The memorandum of respondent speaks for itself: "On <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1978</st1:date>, complaints for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and falsification of public documents and violation
of Section 3601 of the Tariff and Customs Code, docketed as IS No. 1972-78,
were filed against Anderson Beltran with the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="10">October
 19, 1978</st1:date>, a complaint for violation of Arts. 167, 168 and 172 of
the Revised Penal Code, docketed as IS No. 78-1820, was filed against Anderson
Beltran with the Angeles City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the preliminary investigation
conducted by the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office on October 26, 1978 in connection with IS No. 1972-78, Anderson Beltran
executed a waiver of his right under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, * *
*.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By his said waiver, Beltran in effect
admitted the legality of his detention and has rendered the instant petition
for habeas corpus moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
November 3, 1978, an information for falsification of private document was
filed against Anderson Beltran with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> (<span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> Branch I) and
there docketed as Criminal Case No. 3910.* * * On the same day the court issued
an order for the issuance of a warrant of arrest against Anderson Beltran, * *
*.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Court issued a
commitment order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="11">November 3,
 1978</st1:date> directing the Commanding Officer of IRECAD Detention Center, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, to keep
Anderson Beltran in his custody as detention prisoner subject to the order of
the court. * * * Presently, Anderson Beltran is being detained at the IRECAD
Detention Center, Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>, San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, pursuant to the commitment order of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> (<span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
Branch I).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of the commitment
order of the court, the custody of Anderson Beltran has in legal contemplation
been transferred from the military to the civilian authority (<span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> vs. Garcia, 42 SCRA 448, 493 (1971)).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Beltran's detention is now by virtue of a
judicial order, his petition for habeas corpus should be deemed to have been
rendered moot and academic.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such an appraisal of the situation by Solicitor General Mendoza
is impressed with validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This excerpt
from Cruz v. Montoya,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
finds relevance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It would appear
therefore that the writ had served its purpose and whatever illegality might
have originally infested his detention had been cured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense, his petition has become
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is undeniable is that the
ordinary civil process of the law is now being followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grievance complained of therefore no
longer exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, there is adherence
to the basic aim and intent that inform this great writ of liberty which, in
the apt language of Justice Malcolm in the landmark case of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city> v. <span class="SpellE">Lukban</span>, 'is to inquire into all manner of involuntary
restraint as distinguished from voluntary and to relieve a person <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> if such restraint is illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any restraint which will preclude freedom of
action is sufficient.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This it could
accomplish, for as emphatically stressed by Justice Holmes, it 'cuts through
all forms and goes to the very tissue of the structure.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a doctrine was affirmed in the two subsequent cases of De la Plata v. <span class="SpellE">Escorcha</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Cañas</span> v. Director of Prisons.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One last word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1978</st1:date> that Beltran and
Rivera were detained without any criminal charge against them.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The petition was filed on <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="10">October 2,
 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rivera, the driver of
the vehicle allegedly used by Beltran to carry on his smuggling activities, was
not released until <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1978</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of Beltran, the information was not filed until <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1978</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
This is another instance then of the practice, irregular, to say the least, of
persons being restrained of their liberty prior to the filing of any charge or
even in the absence of any justification for such detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no unfairness then in characterizing
the release of Rivera and the filing of an information against Beltran as due
to the filing of the application with this Tribunal for the writ of habeas
corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for this
circumstance, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the officials concerned
would not have been prodded into action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It certainly does not speak well of officialdom, whether civilian or
military, if a person deprived of his liberty had to go to court before his
rights are respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The good name of
the Administration is jeopardized, without any fault on its part, by such
inefficiency or inattention to duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Every precaution should be taken against its repetition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the parties responsible for this
state of affairs would justly lay themselves open to the accusation that the
greatest danger to constitutional rights comes from public officials, men of
zeal, concededly well-meaning, but without sufficient understanding of the
implications of the rule of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is dismissed in the case of Rivera
for being moot and academic, and in the case of Beltran, because of his
commitment being due to a lawful order by a court of justice.</p>
