				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a petition for review of a decision of the Auditor General denying a 
claim for refund of petitioner Casco Philippine Chemical Co., Inc. </p>
<p>The main facts are not disputed. Pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act 
No. 2609, otherwise known as the Foreign Exchange Margin Fee Law, the Central 
Bank of the Philippines issued on July 1, 1959, its Circular No. 95, fixing a 
uniform margin fee of 25% on foreign exchange transactions. To supplement the 
circular, the Bank later promulgated a memorandum establishing the procedure for 
applications for exemption from the payment of said fee, as provided in said 
Republic Act No. 2609. Several times in November and December 1959, petitioner 
Casco Philippine Chemical Co., Inc. which is engaged in the manufacture of 
synthetic resin glues, used in bonding lumber and veneer by plywood and 
hardboard producers-bought foreign exchange for the importation of urea and formaldehyde-which are the main raw materials in the production of said glues 
and paid therefor the aforementioned margin fee aggregating P33.765.42. In May, 
1960, petitioner made another purchase of foreign exchange and paid the sum of 
P6,345.72 as margin fee therefor. </p>
<p>Prior thereto, petitioner had sought the refund of the first sum of 
P33,765.42, relying upon Resolution No. 1529 of the Monetary Board of said Bank, 
dated November 3, 1959, declaring, that the separate importation of urea and 
formaldehyde is exempt from Said fee. Soon after the last importation of these 
products, petitioner made a similar request for refund of the sum of P6,345.72 
paid as margin fee therefor. Although the Central Bank issued the corresponding 
margin fee vouchers for the refund of said amounts, the Auditor of the Bank 
refused to pass in audit and approve said vouchers, upon the ground that the 
exemption granted by the Monetary Board for petitioner's separate importations 
of urea and formaldehyde is not in accord with the provisions of Section 2, 
paragraph XVIII of Republic Act No. 2069. On appeal taken by petitioner, fie 
Auditor General subsequently affirmed said action of the Auditor of the Bank. 
Hence, this petition for review. </p>
<p>The only question for determination in this case is whether or not "urea" and 
"formaldehyde" are exempt by law from the payment of the aforesaid margin fee. 
The pertinent portion of Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2069 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The margin established by the Monetary Board pursuant to the provision of 
section one hereof shall not be imposed upon the sale of foreign exchange for 
the importation of the following: <br><br>"XVIII. Urea, formaldehyde for the 
manufacture of plywood and hardboard when imported by and for the exclusive use 
of endusers " </p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner maintains that the term "urea formaldehyde" appearing in this 
provision should be construed as "urea <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> formaldehyde" (italic ours) and that 
respondents herein, the Auditor General and the Auditor of the Central Bank have 
erred in holding otherwise. In this connection, it should be noted that, whereas 
"urea'" and "formaldehyde" are the principal raw materials in the manufacture of 
synthetic resin glues, the National Institute of Science and Technology has 
expressed, through its Commissioner, the view that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Urea formaldehyde is not a chemical solution. It is the synthetic resin 
formed as a condensation product from definite proportions of urea and 
formaldeyhe under certain conditions relating to temperature, acidity, and time 
of reaction. This produce when applied in water solution and extended with 
inexpensive fillers constitutes' a fairly low cost adhesive for use in the 
manufacture of plywood." </p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, "urea formaldehyde" is clearly a finished product, which is patently 
distinct and different from, "urea" and "formaldehyde", as separate articles 
used in the manufacture of the synthetic resin known as "urea formaldehyde", 
Petitioner contends, however, that the bill approved, in Congress contained the 
copulative conjunction "and" between the terms "urea" and, "formaldehyde", and 
that the members of Congress intended to exempt "urea", and "formaldehyde" 
separately as essential elements in the manufacture of the synthetic resin glue 
called "urea and formaldehyde", not the latter a finished product, citing in 
support of this view the statements made on the floor of the Senate, during the 
consideration of the bill before said House, by members thereof. But, said 
individual statements do not necessarily reflect the view of the Senate. Much 
less do they indicate the intent of the House of Representatives (see Song Kiat 
Chocolate Factory <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Central Bank, 102 Phil., 477 54. Off. Gaz., 615; Mayon 
Motors, Inc. vs. Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 111 Phil. 52-A, Manila 
Jockey Club, Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Games &amp; Amusement Board, 107 Phil., 151. Furthermore, 
it is well settled that the enrolled bill—which uses the term "urea 
formaldehyde" instead of "urea and formaldehyde"— is conclusive upon the courts 
as regards the tenor of the measure passed by Congress and approved by the 
President (Primicias <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Paredes, 61 Phil., 118, 120; Mabanag <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Lopez Vito, 78 
Phil., I; Macias <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Comm. on Elections, L-18684, September 14, 1961). If there 
has been any mistake in the printing of the bill before it was certified by the 
officers of Congress and approved by the Executive—on which we cannot speculate, 
without jeopardizing the principle of separation of powers and undermining one 
of the cornerstones of our democratic system— the remedy is by amendment or 
curative legislation, not by judicial decree."</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
the petitioner. It is so ordered. </p>

Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala </em>and<em> Makalintal. J.J.,</em> concur.</p></div>
