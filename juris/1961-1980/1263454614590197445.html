				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> dated May 31, 1962, rescinding, in favor of
the defendants, the lease agreement entered into by the plaintiff Philippine
Enterprises, Inc. and the defendant Soledad <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
relative to an automatic phonograph, ordering the latter to restore the
phonograph to the former, denying the plaintiff's claim for liquidated and
exemplary damages, attorney's fees and costs of suit, and dismissing the
defendants' counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff
took the appeal to the Court of Appeals which, however, certified it to this
Court because the questions in­volved are of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 6, 1961 the plaintiff, a domestic corpo­ration with
main office in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and a branch office in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, entered into a contract with the defendant
Soledad <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, owner of the Irene's Refreshment
Parlor in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, whereby the former leased to
the latter an automatic phonograph (<span class="SpellE">Seeburg</span> <span class="SpellE">Selectomatic</span> 100-R), more popularly known as
"jukebox".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
provisions of the contract are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1961</st1:date>
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, husband of the de­fendant Soledad <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, wrote the following letter to the plaintiff's
branch office in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>:</p>

<blockquote>"For two (2) weeks ago, I had advice your re­presentative here
in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to get back your jukebox, but until today said representative did not mind us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“So upon receipt of this letter, you are hereby again <span class="SpellE">adviced</span> to get the said Jukebox and failure on your part to
get it, we shall not be responsible any­more for the said Jukebox."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1961</st1:date>
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> wrote another letter to the
plaintiff, this time addressed to its main office in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, informing it of his
letter of July 17 and of the reasons for requesting the return of the jukebox
to the com­pany.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Please may you hear our revelations or rela­tions prior to
the advise we had made to your com­pany regarding our slight difference from
your agent, stationed here in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We requested your agent that the said Juke­box
should be inspected once in a while there are times when them said Jukebox
stock up and the coins which will be dropped will just be confiscated due to
the selected record which will not give our selected music.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About a year ago, we asked your agent here
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
if we could buy your Jukebox.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
replied, 'yes' and he will inform the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that time, we made always
an inquiry if said matter was already referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we were surprised why until last May we
did not hear any word from your agent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we decided to order one from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 3rd, we advised personally your agent
that the said Jukebox should be taken from our establishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He answered us that he will report the matter
to your Central Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From July 3rd
until July 16th, we had not met your agent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the following day, July 17th, we met your agent because he accounted
the income of the said Juke­box and we again told him that the Jukebox should
be taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He replied that he could not
act because there is no letter from us for the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
office ad­vising the return of the said Jukebox.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we made a discussion why he did not tell
us if our letter was necessary; so we wrote a letter on July 17th.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time when he received our letter, he
re­quested for an extension of one (1) week for he would forward our letter to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But according to my wife, your agent told her
that he forwarded our letter last July 22nd.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On July 24th, we fi­nally decided to return the said Jukebox and even
have ready laborers to help us load the Jukebox on your pick-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your agent, Mr. Gonzales, remarked angrily
that he would not accept the said Jukebox but will just deposit it in our
establishment until the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> office will act on
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him, your agent, Mr.
Gonzales, we could not remove the said Jukebox from the place because there was
a con­tract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, Mr. Gonzales
calmly requested us again to have an additional extension of one (1) more
week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this situation we were very
embar­rassed because there were many customers and other persons present during
our discussions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right on that day, we
transferred your Jukebox inside our <span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span>
room without any business because Mr. Gonzales told us that the said Jukebox
should be deposited only in our establishment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your agent Mr. Gonzales, is a good agent on the other world but not in
this world where we are living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Begin­ning
July 24th until the time you will get the Jukebox, we are going to collect a
monthly rental of Fifty Pesos (P50.00) for the space occupying the
Jukebox."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its reply of <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="8">August 4,
 1961</st1:date> the plaintiff stated that -</p>

<blockquote>"the stocking up of coins is quite
normal in any coin-operated phonograph, as well as failure to get the desired
selection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been the po­licy of
our company, however, to give top priori­ty to the complaints of our
customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not clear from your
letter whether our Branch Manage for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
has been remiss in his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are willing
to give the benefit of the doubt by concluding that he might have failed to
respond to your calls in time and I assure you that im­mediate instructions
will be issued from this office directing him to give personal attention to any
service that you might wish in connection with the said Juice box."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It as well denied knowledge of the
defendants' desire to buy a jukebox and deplored the fact that the defendants
ordered one from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
without first sending the request to buy directly to it since the plaintiff was
anyway willing to sell a jukebox to any interested person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Calling atten­tion to paragraph 9 of the
lease contract which gave it the exclusive right to maintain an automatic
phonograph in the defendants, premises, the plaintiff asked the defendants to
re-install its jukebox and remove the other one which the defendants had
installed in their premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 4 and <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="10">October
 16, 1961</st1:date>, the plaintiff, through counsel, wrote the defendant
spouses, demanding anew compliance with the lease contract and the payment of
damages, and warning them that it would file the corresponding action in court
if they did not comply with its demand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the defendants re­fused the demand, the plaintiff brought action in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on November 21,
1961, praying for the return to it of the automatic phonograph, subject of the
contract of lease, and the payment of P5,850 as liquidated damages, P5,000 as
exemplary damages, P500 as attorney's fees and P500 as expenses of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the parties' stipulation of facts, their pleadings and the
documentary evidence submitted by them as annexes to the stipulation of facts
and pleadings, the lower court ren­dered the decision hereinbefore adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff imputes four errors to the lower court, the vital
one being the court's holding that the facts fully warrant a rescission of the
contract of lease in favor of the defendants by reason of the plaintiff's
failure to perform its obligation to render the automatic phonograph suitable
for the purpose for which it was intended.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our view that the decision of the lower court should be
reversed on three grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to
rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones in case one of the obligors
should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the Civil Code provides.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
But it is equally settled that, in the absence of a stipulation to the
contrary, this power must be invoked judicially; it cannot be exercised solely
on a party's own judgment that the other has committed a breach of the
obligation.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, as there is nothing in the contract of lease empowering the defendants
to rescind it without resort to the courts, the defendants' action in
unilaterally terminating the contract is unjustified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court said in <span class="SpellE"><u>Escueta</u></span>
<u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Pando</u></span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The defendant could not, by himself
alone and without judicial intervention, resolve or annul the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under article 1124 [now art. 1191] of the
Civil Code, the right to resolve reciprocal obligations, in case one of the obligors
shall fail to comply with that which is incumbent upon him, is deemed to be
implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that right must be invoked
judicially; for the same article also provides:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'The court shall decree the resolution demanded, unless there should be
grounds which justify the allowance of a term for the performance of the
obligation.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rescission
will be ordered only where the breach complained of is substantial as to defeat
the object of the parties in entering into the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will not be granted where the breach is
slight or casual.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The defendants asked the plaintiff to retrieve its phonograph, claiming that
there were times when the coins dropped into the slot would got stuck,
resulting in its failure to play the desired music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But apart from this bare statement, there is
nothing in the evidence which shows the frequency with which the jukebox failed
to function properly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The expression
"there are times" connotes occasional failure of the phonograph to
operate, not frequent enough to render it unsuitable and unserviceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, there is not even a
claim that, as a result of unsatisfactory performance thereof, the income <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> dropped to such a level that the defendants could
not even pay the plaintiff its gua­ranteed share of P50 a week. On the
contrary, the evidence (Stipulation of Facts, Annexes J, K, L, M, N, and 0)
shows that, during the period complained of, the operation of the jukebox was
quite profitable to both parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe
that the defendants actually bought a jukebox only in 1961 after they had
signed the lease contract question, although they might have expressed a desire
to buy one the year before, for otherwise they would not have entered into a
three-year lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But certainly their
decision to buy a jukebox and operate it themselves was made long before they
ever complained in July, 1961 of any defect in the rented juke­box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, it is not shown when the rented
phonograph sup­posedly developed trouble; presumably it was early in July, 1961,
since the defendants' first letter of complaint was written on July 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if, as defendants admit, they began
operating their own jukebox "sometime in July, 1961" (presumably on
July 24,1961 when they removed the rented jukebox from where it was installed),
then the defendants’ pretense that they decided to buy their own jukebox only
after the rented one had failed to function proper­ly becomes highly
improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jukebox which they
ordered from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could not have arrived in so short a time as to enable them to operate it on
July 24.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are rather inclined to believe that the decision to buy a
jukebox was made because the defendants found it more profitable to operate one
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their letter of July 17,
1961, in which they demanded the removal of the rented jukebox from their
premises, with the warning that they would not be "respon­sible
anymore" for it, and their other letter of July 27 of like tenor, betray
the haste with which they wanted to get out of their contractual obligations to
the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note that they did not
even ask the plaintiff to service the rented juke­box; they asked the plaintiff
to remove the jukebox or they would charge rental for the use of the space
occupied by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The con­viction cannot
be avoided that the jukebox which the defendants had ordered from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> had arrived and the latter thereafter
conjured up a reason for operating it without being charged with violation of
the lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants'
pretenses cannot excuse their culpable violation of the lease contract; their
conduct fully justifies the award of liquidated damages to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is reversed,
and the con­tract of lease between the plaintiff and the defendant Soledad <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> is hereby rescinded in favor of the
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants are ordered to
return to the plaintiff the automatic phonograph subject of the contract, and
to pay the plaintiff liquidated damages in the total amount of P5,850, plus 6
per cent interest from the date of the filing of the complaint until the amount
shall have been fully paid, and attorney's fees in the amount of P200.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the defendants.</p>
