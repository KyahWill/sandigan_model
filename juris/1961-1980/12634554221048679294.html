				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The policy relentlessly adhered to and unhesitatingly pursued to
minimize, if not to do away entirely, with the evil and corruption that
smuggling brings in its wake would be frustrated and set at naught if the
action taken by respondent Commissioner of Customs in this case, as affirmed by
the Court of Tax Appeals, were to be set aside and this <span class="GramE">appeal</span>
from the decision of the latter were to succeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, the controlling principles of
law do not call for a contrary conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be otherwise if the legitimate authority vested in the
government were not to be reduced to futility and impotence in the face of an
admittedly serious <span class="GramE">malady, that</span> at times has assumed
epidemic proportions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal question raised by petitioners, owners of five
sailing vessels and the cargo loaded therein declared forfeited by respondent
Commissioner of Customs for smuggling, is the validity of their interception
and seizure by customs officials on the high seas, the contention being raised
that importation had not yet begun and that the seizure was effected outside
our territorial waters.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Why such a plea could not
be given the least credence without doing violence to common sense and placing
the law in disrepute would be apparent from a statement of the case and the
findings of facts as set forth in the decision now under review, of the Court </span>of
Tax Appeals, dated November 19, 1964, the opinion being penned by the late
Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">His opinion starts
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is an appeal from the
decision of the Acting Commissioner of Customs in Customs Case No. 113, dated
September 26, 1961, (<span class="SpellE">Jolo</span> Seizure Identification
Cases Nos. 38, 39, 40, 41 &amp; 42) decreeing the forfeiture of five (5)
sailing </span>vessels (<span class="SpellE">kumpits</span>) named '<span class="SpellE">Iroc-Iroc</span>,' '<span class="SpellE">Lahat-lahat</span>,' 'Liberal
Wing III,' '<span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> Area Command,' and 'Business,' with
their respective cargoes of blue seal cigarettes and rattan chairs, for
violation of Section 1363(a) of the Revised Administrative Code and Section 20
of Republic Act No. 426 in relation with Section 1363(f) of the Revised
Administrative Code."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts according to the above opinion "are not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>." Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It appears that on <st1:date year="1950" day="10" month="9">September
 10, 1950</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>
time, a customs patrol team on board Patrol Boat ST-23 intercepted the five (5)
sailing vessels in question on the high seas, between British North <st1:place>Borneo</st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> while they were heading towards <span class="SpellE">Tawi-tawi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After ordering the vessels to stop, the
customs officers boarded and found on board, 181 cases of 'Herald' cigarettes,
9 cases of 'Camel' cigarettes, and some pieces of rattan chairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sailing vessels are all of Philippine
registry, owned and manned by Filipino residents of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>,
and of less than thirty (30) tons burden.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They came from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sandakan</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
British North <st1:place>Borneo</st1:place>, but did not possess any permit
from the Commissioner of Customs to engage in the importation of merchandise
into any port of the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> <span class="GramE">sea</span></st1:place>, as required by Section 1363(a) of the
Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
cargoes were not covered by the required import license under Republic Act No.
426, otherwise known as the Import Control Law."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner of Customs, as noted at the outset,
affirmed the decision rendered by the Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>, who found cause for forfeiture under the law of the
vessels and the cargo contained therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was, as also already made known, sustained by the Court of Tax
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this
petition for review.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first two errors assigned by petitioners would impugn the
jurisdiction of the Bureau of Customs to institute seizure proceedings and
thereafter to declare the forfeiture of the vessels in question and their
cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would justify their stand
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the light of the fact
that the vessels involved with the articles laden therein were apprehended and
seized on the high seas, beyond the territorial waters of the Philippines, the
said vessels could not have touched any place or port in the Philippines,
whether a port or place of entry or not, consequently, the said vessels could
not have been engaged in the importation of the articles laden therein into any
Philippine port or place, whether <span style="">a </span>port
or place of entry or not, to have incurred the liability of forfeiture under
Section 1363(a) of the Revised Administrative Code.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such <span style="">a </span>contention
was advanced by petitioners before the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It met the repudiation that it deserved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus "We perfectly see the point of the
petitioners but considering the circumstances surrounding the apprehension of
the vessels in question, we believe that Section 1363(a) of the Revised
Administrative Code should be applied to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been established that the five vessels
came from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sandakan</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
British North <st1:place>Borneo</st1:place>, a foreign port, and when
intercepted, all of them were heading towards <span class="SpellE">Tawi-tawi</span>,
a domestic port within the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> <span class="GramE">sea</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Laden with foreign manu­factured cigarettes, they did not possess the
import license required by Republic Act No. 426, nor did they carry a permit
from the Commissioner of Customs to engage in importation into any part in the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> <span class="GramE">sea</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their course announced loudly their intention
not merely to skirt along the territorial boundary of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
but to come within our limits and land some­where in <span class="SpellE">Tawi-tawi</span>
towards which their prows were pointed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, they were about to cross our aquatic boundary but
for the intervention of a customs patrol which, from all appear­ances, was more
than eager to accomplish its mission. "<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The sense of realism and the vigorous language employed by the
late Judge <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> in rejecting such a plea deserve
to be quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To entertain even for a moment the
thought that these vessels were probably not bound <span style="">for a </span>Philippine port would be too much a concession even for a
simpleton or a perennial optimist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
quite irrational for Filipino sailors manning five Philippine vessels to sneak <span style="">out </span>of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and go to British North <st1:place>Borneo</st1:place>, and <span class="GramE">come</span>
a long way back laden with highly taxable goods only to turn about upon
reaching the brink of our territorial waters and head for another foreign
port."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">1. We find no plausible reason not to accept in its entirety such
a conclusion reached by the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor, even if the persuasive element in the
above view were not so overwhelming, could we alter the decisive facts as found
by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is now beyond question
that its finding, if supported by substantial evidence, binds us, only
questions of law being for us to resolve.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the issue raised belongs to the former category, we lack the power
of <span style="">review.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, for understandable reasons, we feel extreme reluctance
to substitute our own discretion for that of the Court of Tax Appeals in its
appreciation of the relevant facts and its appraisal of their
significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we had occasion to
state in a relatively recent decision:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Nor as a matter of principle is it advisable for this Court to set
aside the conclusion reached by an agency such as the Court <span style="">a </span>Tax Appeals which is, by the very
nature of its function, dedicated exclusively to the study and consideration of
tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject, * * *,
there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of its authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2. We thus could rest our decision affirming that of the Court of
Tax Appeals on the above consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It might not be amiss however to devote some degree of attention to the
legal points raised in the above two assignment of errors, discussed jointly by
petitioners-appellants, alleging the absence of jurisdiction, the deprivation
of<span style=""> </span>property without due process
of law and the abatement of liability consequent upon the repeal of Republic
Act No. 426.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not one of the principles
of law relied upon suffices to call for reversal of the action taken by the re­spondent
Commissioner of Customs, even if the facts presented a situation less
conclusive against the pretension of petitioners-appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the apprehension and seizure of the vessels in question on
the high seas beyond the territorial waters of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the absence of jurisdiction of Commissioner of Customs is predi­cated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such contention of petitioners-appellants is
without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is unquestioned that all vessels seized are of Philippine
registry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Revised Penal Code leaves
no doubt as to its applicability and enforceability not only within the
Philippines, its interior waters and maritime zone, but also outside of its
jurisdiction against those committing offense while on a Philip­pine ship * *
*.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The principle of law that sustains the validity of such a provision equally
supplies a firm foundation for the seizure of the five sailing vessels found
thereafter to have violated the applicable provisions of the Revised Adminis­trative
Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is a well settled doctrine of International Law that
goes back to Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Church v. <span class="SpellE">Hubbart</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>an
1804 decision, that a state has the right to protect itself and its revenues, a
right not limited to its own territory but extending to the high seas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Chief Justice Marshall:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The authority of a nation within its
own territory is absolute and exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The seizure of a vessel within the range of its cannon by a foreign
force is an invasion of that territory, and is a hostile act which it is its duty
to repel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But its power to secure itself
from injury may certainly be exercised beyond the limits of its
territory."</p>

<p class="BODY">The question asked in the brief of petitioners-appellants as to
whether the seizure of the vessels in question and the cargoes on the high seas
and thus beyond the territorial waters of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was legal must be answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. The next question raised is the alleged denial of due process
arising from such forfeiture and seizure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The argument on the alleged lack of validity of the action taken by the Com­missioner
of Customs is made to rest on the fact that the alleged offense imputed to
petitioners-appellants is a violation of Section 1363(a) and not Section 1363
(f).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The title of Section 1363 is
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">"Property
subject to forfeiture under customs laws."</span> The first subsection
thereof, (a), covers any vessel including cargo unlaw­fully engaged in the
importation of merchandise except a port of entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsection (f) speaks of any merchandise of
any prohibited importation, the importation of which is effected or attempted
contrary to law and all other merchandise which in the opinion of the Collector
of Customs have been used are or were intended to be used as instrument in the
importation or exportation of the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above recital of the legal provisions relied upon, it
would appear most clearly that the due process question raised is
insubstantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the facts on
which the seizure was based were not unknown to petitioners-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On those facts the liability of the vessels
and merchandise under the above terms of the statute would appear to be un­deniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action taken then by the Commissioner of
Customs was in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">How could there be a denial of due process?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">was
</span>nothing arbitrary about the manner in which such seizure and forfeiture
were <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right to a hearing of petitioners-appellants was respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could not have been unaware of what they
were doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be an affront to
reason if under the above circumstances they could be allowed to <span class="GramE">raise</span> in all seriousness a due process question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a constitutional guaranty, basic and
fundamental, certainly should not be allowed to lend itself as an instrument
for escaping a liability arising from one's own nefarious acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. Petitioners-appellants would further assail the validity of
the action taken by the respondent Commissioner of Customs by the plea that the
repeal of Republic Act No. 426 abated what­ever liability could have been
incurred there under.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument <span class="GramE">raised</span> before the Court of Tax Appeals was correctly held
devoid of any persuasive force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision under review cited our opinion in <span class="SpellE">Golay-Buchel</span>
&amp; <span class="SpellE">Cie</span> v. Commissioner of Customs<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that the expiration of the Import Control Law "did not
produce the effect of declaring legal the importation of goods which were
illegally imported and the seizure and forfeiture thereof as ordered by the
Collector of Customs illegal or null and void."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sayoc</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
announced that principle earlier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Herein, we are concerned
with the effect of the expiration of a law, not with the abrogation of a law,
and we hold the view that once the Commissioner of Customs has acquired
jurisdiction over the case, the mere expiration of Republic Act No. 650 will
not divest him of his jurisdiction thereon duly acquired while said law was
still in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, we
believe that despite the expiration of Republic Act No. 650 the Commissioner of
Customs retained his jurisdiction over the case and could continue to take
cognizance thereof until its final determination, for the main question brought
in by the appeal from the decision of the Collector of Customs was the legality
or illegality of the decision of the Collector of Customs, and that question
could not have been abated by the mere expiration of Republic Act No. 650.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We firmly believe that the expiration of
Republic Act No. 650 could not have produced the effect (1) of declaring legal
the importation of the cotton counterpanes which were illegally imported, and
(2) of declaring the seizure and forfeiture ordered by the Collector of Customs
illegal or null and void; in other words, it could not have the effect of
annulling or setting aside the decision of the Collector of Customs which was
rendered while the law was in force and which should stand until it is revoked
by the appellate tribunal."</p>

<p class="BODY">As late as 1965, in Bombay Dept. Store v. Commissioner of
Customs,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
we had occasion to reaffirm the doctrine in the above two decisions, the
present Chief Justice, speaking for the Court, stating that such expiration of
the period of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No. 650
"did not have the effect of depriving the Commissioner of Customs of the
jurisdiction, acquired by him prior thereto, to act on cases of forfeiture
pending before him, which are in the nature of proceedings <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> * * *."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus most evident that the Court of Tax Appeals had not in
any wise refused to adhere faithfully to controlling legal principles when it
sustained the action taken by respondent Commissioner <span style="">of </span>Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a
reproach and a reflection on the law if on the facts as they had been shown to
exist, the seizure and forfeiture of the vessels and cargo in question were to
be characterized as outside the legal compe­tence of our government and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the constitutional rights of
petitioners-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, as
had been made clear above, that would be an undeserved reflection and an
unwarranted reproach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vigor of the
war against smuggling must not be hampered by a misreading of inter­national
law concepts and a misplaced reliance on a consti­tutional guaranty that has
not in any wise been infringed.</p>
