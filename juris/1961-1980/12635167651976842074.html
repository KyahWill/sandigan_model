direct evidence and the respective turns of each of the three came to present
his evidence, each of the latter, one after another and at different times,
with­drew his plea of not guilty, pleaded guilty, and threw himself to the
mercy of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First was <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="12">December

similarly sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>

of 19 year-old defendant <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> – who was heard on a separate trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>
was sentenced by the trial court to the supreme penalty of death with the
accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra,
jointly and severally, with the other co-accused already convicted, in the

<p class="BODY">About <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon of <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1961</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> Burgos <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Guerra, wife of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>

were looking for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The five introduced
themselves as Philippine Constabulary soldiers on a mission to inspect firearms
as it was nearing the election period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> Burgos Guerra invited them in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the five were in conversation with <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra, <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> served
them coffee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in the course of
that conversation that the five informed <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra that they would want to see the barrio captain the follow­ing morning,
and that because they were very tired, they would rest in the house for the
night.</p>

<p class="BODY">About <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the evening, <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> Burgos Guerra served a chicken
and rice dinner for the five who sat with <span class="SpellE">Floren­tino</span>
Guerra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After dinner, one of the five
asked <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra if they could see the
latter's shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
obliged, showed it to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> who remarked that
they would examine the number of the gun the following morning alleging diffi­culty
because the serial number was in very small figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also inquired if anybody around also had
firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra told them that a former <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> by the name of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos had a carbine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Told that the five would like somebody to
accompany them to the house of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra sent his nephew, <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leones</span>, to fetch <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> whose home was about five meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the arrival of <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leones</span> and <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span>, the two accompanied <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> to the house of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
Ramos less than a kilometer away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Battung</span> and Antonio
<span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> were left behind in the Guerra house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sensing nothing wrong, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra allowed <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> to take
along with them the shotgun to arrest <span class="SpellE">Vic­torio</span>
Ramos.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a field about 50 to 60 meters from the house of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span> were left and told to wait.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> proceeded to the Ramos' home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After sometime, <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, with <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
Ramos whose hands were tied at his back, returned to the place where <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span> were left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, accompanied
by <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leones</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>,
proceeded to other houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first two
left instructions to <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> to keep watch on <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos and warned them, <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span>
and Ramos, not to talk to each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span> came back after
sometime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were accom­panied by
Santos <span class="SpellE">Umicay</span> and Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Cayaban</span>,
each of the last two having his hands tied at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> tied the hands of <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leones</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
also at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> hastened to explain to <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leones</span> that they had
to do so in order that <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos would not
complain that he was the only one tied up and to allay the fear that their
companions might entertain that they had maltreated <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, with the shotgun of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra, and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>,
led <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span>, Santos <span class="SpellE">Umicay</span>, Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Cayaban</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos back to the house of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the yard of the Guerra home, one from the house
noticed their presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Battung</span> and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> went down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> took the gun from <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Corpuz</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> stood guard over the persons brought to the yard and
warned the latter against attempt to escape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Four of the defendants, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Battung</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, returned to the house of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>
remained on the ground to keep watch over the persons brought there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four woke up the people inside the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leones</span>, Felipe Guerra and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also woke up the four women in the
house.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was then that <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Battung</span> (who is at large)
revealed their true color, that is, that they were not Philippine Constabulary
soldiers but <span class="SpellE"><u>tulisan</u></span>, meaning bandits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They tied up <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span>,
Felipe Guerra and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They demanded money from <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra and <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> Burgos Guerra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They brought to the yard <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leones</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> and Felipe Guerra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, they told <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra and the others to give up their money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter answered that they had none.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> started maltreating them.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After which, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra was brought back into the house by <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Battung</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These four
once again asked for the money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra told his wife to give money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, however, reminded her husband
that he himself had money in his pocket.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra then stated that he could
not get the money in his pocket because his hands were tied at his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four then helped each other in extracting
the money from the pocket of <span class="SpellE">Floren­tino</span> Guerra.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only able to get P48 from <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra's pocket, the bandits were far from satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maltreated <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span>
Burgos Guerra in an effort to extract more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was hit on the head by <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> who told her that he "allegedly heard from
other persons" that the spouses, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra and <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> Burgos Guerra, had "ten
thousand pesos".<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
So she opened her wardrobe and was forced to reveal the hiding place of their
cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Battung</span> started ransacking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their efforts netted them money in cash, including the P48 taken from
the pocket of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra, amounting to P248,
the shotgun, 25 rounds of ammunition, and assorted articles, all in all <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P862.50.</p>

<p class="BODY">The four women in the house, namely, <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span>
Burgos Guerra, her sister-in-law Maria Guerra, and two other women guests, were
all gagged up and tied together to a wall near the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were warned not to cry out or leave on
pain of being killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra was brought down
again to the yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> took a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> rope made
of vine and tied all the nine persons herded in the yard (Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span>, Santos <span class="SpellE">Umicay</span>, <span class="SpellE">lnocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span>, Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Cayaban</span>, Felipe
Guerra and <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos), the right arm of one tied
to the right arm of another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the
while, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> was guarding their prisoners
with the gun on the ready.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The five
brought the nine persons, hands tied at the back and one tied to the other, to
the foot of a hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> was at the back of the nine men keeping eye on
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That place at the foot of a hill
was about a kilometer away from the house of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra, forested and uninhabited being about 200 meters from the nearest house.</p>

<p class="BODY">There, the five ordered their victims to lie down face
downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in this condition that
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra, Santos <span class="SpellE">Umicay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leones</span>, in that order, were hacked with a
sharp-bladed weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the five
accused, with their booty, left the nine still lying on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The five gave a parting warning that they
(the nine persons) should stay there until they rot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victims were able to untie
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ran in different
directions into the forest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> was left; he died on the spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra
sat under a bamboo grove and was left there.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> reported to <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> Burgos
Guerra that her husband was at the foot of a hill, wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the behest of <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span>
Burgos Guerra, <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span> brought <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra to their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From there, he was placed in a motorboat and
brought to the <span class="SpellE"><u>centro</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">Baggao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra was being removed from the truck in front of the municipal building, he
died.</p>

L. <span class="SpellE">Caculitan</span>, Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Baggao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, show that <span class="SpellE">Floren­tino</span> Guerra received the following wounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bolo wound, horizontal in position at the
occipital region about 5 1/2 inches long and pene­trating through the whole

at the <span class="SpellE">occipito-bregmatic</span> region, about 5 inches
long, each cutting through the outer table of the skull.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hemorrhage, severe, and shock due to brain
injury, secondary to bolo wounds at the head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Caculitan's</span> findings in his autopsy report
on the person of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>bolo wound, horizontal in position, just
below the occipital region about 6 inches long and 2 inches deep; rope marks at
both wrists indicative of hands being tied together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>, as in the case of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>

<p class="NUM">1. The defense of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> is
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he did not leave

day of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that he
had a pimple on the right side of his abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This pimple, as described by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>,
was as big as the closed fist of the trial judge or about four inches in
diameter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He averred that he contracted
fever because of his pimple; that he was uncon­scious during all the time that
he had his pimple; that he could not even open his eyes nor talk; that when he
was brought to the hos­pital by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mallillin</span>, he
was unconscious and did not know he was brought to the hospital; that he did
not know that he left the hospital because he was in delirium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This defense suffers from infirmities.</p>

and who came and stayed in the house of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra from <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00</st1:time> or <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time> until he was tied up and brought down

received bolo wounds but survived, positively told the court, in the words of
the trial judge, "that he really saw this Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>
who was the very person holding the shotgun of his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Guerra, and who pointed said gun at them, guarding them, so that not one of
them should escape from their clutches."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> corroborated <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that it was <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> (with <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span>) who accompanied
defendants <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> to
the house of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos and back, and was one of
those later on brought to the foot of the hill where the killing took
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, he had more than ample
opportunity to identify the accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reference to the alleged fact that Antonio
<span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> could not have left his house on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1961</st1:date> because he had a
pimple on the right side of his abdomen, the trial judge's finding is this:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court observed that the scar indicated by the accused
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> is not a scar of a pimple that
burst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court saw without any mistake
that the scar consisted of zigzagging scars which zigzagging the Court observed
must have been caused by the suturing of the wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scar is not circular, but elongated about
several inches long, showing still the traces of the sutur­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mallillin</span>
himself, the wound was caused by a shotgun in <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mallillin</span>
is nearer the truth. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Even the record of
the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> Provincial Hospital which was brought in
by another witness called by the defense, Lourdes Villanueva who testified,
showed that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> was treated in the
hospital for wounds on the <span class="SpellE">hypochendriac</span> and that
without the knowledge of any person in the hospital this Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> left and, there­fore, was considered
discharged."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fact, counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
before this Court discarded the theory of alibi and considered as substantially
correct the findings of the trial judge.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The thesis for Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> is
that he should be held guilty only of robbery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason given is that there was no explicit evidence that he hacked
and killed <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>; that the plan was only to rob, not to kill; that
the killing took place after the complete perpetration of the robbery; that he
(Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>) was not the leader of the gang as
he only stood guard and watched the herded men.</p>

<p class="BODY">But clear in the record is the fact that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, father of <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> who had pleaded guilty, was with the group from the
start.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He acted in concert with his
cohorts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He played an important
role.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was one of those who lured the
Guerra couple into the belief that the five of them were Constabulary soldiers
on a legitimate mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got hold of
the gun, stood guard over the herded men, warned them, and with gun in hand
made certain that the latter could not escape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not only that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The robbery in
house having already been committed, he still went with the other four
co-accused and the victims from that house to a distant, secluded and forested
place at the foot of a hill, all the while holding the fire­arm with which to
foil escape of the victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He performed
his part to the end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the
record suggests that he prevented the killing of the two victims and the
wounding of the other two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a
community of purpose amongst all of the five.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> draws
our attention to the fact that there is no crime of robbery with double homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term "homicide" in paragraph 1
of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code is to be understood in a generic
sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It includes murder.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the juridical concept of robbery with homicide does not limit the
taking of human life to one single victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If more than one were killed by reason or on the occasion of the
robbery, this circumstance does not authorize punishment for sepa­rate
independent offense or offenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"All the homicides or murders are merged in the composite, integrated
whole that is robbery with homicide so long as all the killings were
perpetrated by reason or on the occasion of the robbery."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the same way that if two persons perished on the occasion of a
robbery such circumstance would not bring about the crime of robbery with
double homicide, much less should we consider slight physical injuries
committed against Santos <span class="SpellE">Umicay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Leones</span> as authorizing
classification of the crime as "robbery with double homicide and physical
injuries" as dec­lared by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This crime of slight physical injuries, which is of very much less
importance than homicide and appear­ing in the same Title Eight, "Crimes <span class="GramE">Against</span> Persons" in the Revised Penal Code, is merged
in the crime of robbery with homicide. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">So that the crime remains to be robbery with homi­cide defined in
paragraph 1 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">4. Having reached the conclusion that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>
is a principal in the crime of robbery with homicide, we now direct attention
to the circumstances bearing on the penalty imposable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> does
not suggest the existence of any circumstance in mitigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, there is none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But aggravating circumstances there are.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u> is craft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio
<span class="SpellE">Saquing</span> and his co-accused posed as Philippine
Constabulary soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that they
should not be believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span> was in fatigue uniform with a <st1:place>West
 Point</st1:place> khaki cap on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three
of them, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ed­mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarubbo</span>, had each a side arm known as <span class="SpellE"><u>paltik</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is because of such false representation
that they gained the confidence of the people in the home of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra and <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span>
Burgos Guerra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Saulog</u></span>, 74 Phil. 526, 539, this Court ruled that
craft is an aggravating circumstance in robbery with homicide where the accused
pretended that they were <span class="SpellE">Pampangos</span> who had lost their
way, asked the victim to be shown the way, the victim inviting them to come up
his house, after which they robbed and killed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So is craft aggravating in rob­bery where
defendant illegally wore a constabulary uniform.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In a 1965 decision, we held in a murder case that craft is aggravating where
the accused pretended to be <u>rancheros</u> to gain entry into the place of
the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dwelling is
properly appreciated as an aggravating circumstance in robbery with homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Third</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery is likewise an attendant
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victims were made to
lie face down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hands of each of them
were tied at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
helpless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime was committed in the
dead of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, there was
treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <st1:state><st1:place><u>Madrid</u></st1:place></st1:state>,
<u>supra</u>, p. 15, a robbery with homicide case, we held treachery to be
aggravating where the two victims "were killed while bound in such a way
as to be deprived of opportunity to repel the attack or escape with any
possibility of success."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>Fourth</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing on the occasion of the robbery
was committed in an uninhabited place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From where the robbery took place, the victims were taken to the foot of
a hill about a kilometer <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, an area which was
secluded, the nearest house being about 200 meters away, and which was forested
and uninhabited.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that in the commission of the crime of rob­bery
with homicide, there were four aggravating circumstances with none in
offset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mandatory it is for this Court
to impose the supreme penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Omitted in the decision below is the indemnity for the things the
subject of the robbery in the total value of P862.50.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we find defendant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Saquing</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Tonio</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of robbery with homicide, and sentence him to death, to indemnify the
widow and heirs of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Guerra in the sum of
P862.50, and likewise to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
