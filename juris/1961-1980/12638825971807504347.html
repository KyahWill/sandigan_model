				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">William Page appealed from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dated July 21, 1973, convicting him
of robbery with homicide, sentencing him to <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>,
and ordering him to pay the heirs of Veronica <span class="SpellE">Villaverde-Bala­capo</span>
an indemnity of P12,000 plus P20,000 as moral damages (Criminal Case No.
5396).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of conviction was
based on the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">According to Page's confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> C), at around four o'clock in the afternoon of
February 13, 1972 <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Campo­sano</span>,
alias Boy <span class="SpellE">Sankay</span>, a resident of <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ilog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, went to the
house of William Page y <span class="SpellE">Ubiña</span> located at 143 <span class="SpellE">Pildira</span> Street, near the Manila International Airport, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were friends since boyhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page was an
eighteen-year old third year high school student at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Arellano</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H).</p>

<p class="BODY">From <span class="GramE">Page' s</span> house, the two went to <span class="SpellE">Camposano's</span> house, where they met the latter's father who
was drinking with a com­panion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>' father gave Page some liquor to drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
stayed at the latter's house up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).</p>

<p class="BODY">At past <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time>,
Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> went to the <span class="SpellE">rotonda</span>
or intersection of <st1:street><st1:address>Taft Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>
and <st1:street><st1:address>F. B. Harrison Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>,
where they boarded a Manila-bound <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page was armed with a <span class="SpellE"><u>balisong</u></span>
knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
had a revolver.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Page's confession, he seated himself beside a male
passenger who was near the driver on the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> took a
seat at the back of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> where two female
passengers were seated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The male
passenger turned out to be <span class="SpellE">Randolf</span> Scot, a
thirty-year old employee of the Hyatt Regency Hotel who was on his way to
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The female passen­gers were the
sisters, Veronica <span class="SpellE">Villaverde-Balacapo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cesarea</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaverde</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">When the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was in front of the
San Antonio Savings Bank on Harrison Boulevard, Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
told the driver to turn left on <span class="SpellE">Russel</span> Avenue, going
to M. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Boule­vard, and then to turn left going
to <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, they held up the driver and the three passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They got the money and pieces of jewelry of
the passengers and the driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
rear view mirror of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, Page saw <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> dumping the two female passengers on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street> in front of
Casa Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the two directed the
driver to proceed to the airport.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
left the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Pildira</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> (where Page
resided).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
gave Page a watch and a woman's ring as his share of the loot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Page admitted that he had been charged with theft but the case
was dismissed in the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
knew certain hoodlums named Remy, <span class="SpellE">Manoling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Guerson</span> and Edgar whose specialty was holding up taxicabs (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).</p>

<p class="BODY">Scot gave a slightly different version of the holdup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that when the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> reached that portion of <st1:street><st1:address>Harri­son
  Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street> in front of the San Antonio Savings
Bank, Page pressed a knife at the neck of Scot and shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is a holdup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't move." Page got <span class="GramE">Scot'
s</span> diary book containing a one peso bill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Page ordered the driver, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Dilla</span>, to
shut off the lights of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, to turn left on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Russel</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, and to proceed
to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
covered their faces with pieces of cloth.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> told the women passengers to
bring out their money and not to shout "or else there will be
shots".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rep­lied that they had
already given everything to <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was in front of Casa
Marcos and El <span class="SpellE">Presidente</span> Hotel, one of the women
jumped out of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The husband of one of the women was a waiter
at Casa Marcos).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other woman
shouted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
kicked her, thus causing her to fall out of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> noticed
that a car was following the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Believing that it was a police car, he
ordered Villa (<span class="SpellE">Dilla</span>) to drive at full speed.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Scot, at an isolated place called <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Baltao</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> near the
airport, Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> told the driver to
stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page robbed Scot of his other one
peso bill and divested the driver of his earnings after boxing him for making
some resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the two
malefactors fled to a dark alley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scot
and the driver re­ported the holdup to the police of <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was already eleven o' clock.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>,
the precinct commander, showed them a photograph of <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dilla</span> and Scot
identified him as one of the two hoodlums.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> and the two robbery victims repaired
to the residence of <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> at <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ilog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They saw <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>,
whom <span class="SpellE">Dilla</span> fingered, but <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
fired shots at them and was able to elude pursuit due to the darkness of the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was later killed by the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
policemen while he was committing another crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day policemen went to Page's residence near the airport
to apprehend him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father, in the presence of his aunt,
promised to surrender him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Page was arrested in the morning of <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1972</st1:date> at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Jose</st1:placename>

was taken down by Patrolman C. <span class="SpellE">Prepeña</span> and sworn to
before the municipal judge (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The woman, who jumped from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> (according to Scot's story), was Veronica <span class="SpellE">Balacapo</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was brought to the Philippine General Hospital by a <span class="GramE">good</span>
Samaritan, <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Daval</span>
Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was already dead when she
reached the hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other woman, <span class="SpellE">Cesarea</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaverde</span> (the sister of Veronica), who was pushed by <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> out of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, was
brought to the <span class="SpellE">Ospital</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Maynila</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
is not clear as to whether she survived.</p>

<p class="BODY">The postmortem examination of the body of Veronica <span class="SpellE">Balacapo</span>, a forty-two year old married woman, revealed that
she suffered (1) abrasions on the left eyebrow, left shoulder, left elbow and sacral
region; (2) bilateral severe <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> on the
occipital region of the scalp; (3) fractures on the base of the cranial <span class="SpellE">fossa</span> and the fourth and fifth ribs along the mid-<span class="SpellE">clavicular</span> line, and (4) hemorrhage in the posterior
cranial <span class="SpellE">fossa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Death was caused by the severe and traumatic <span class="SpellE">meningeal</span>
he­morrhage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A and F).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1972</st1:date>
or before Page was arrested, the chief of police filed a complaint for robbery
with murder in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> and John Doe (Criminal Case No.
30039).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was based on the
investigation of <span class="SpellE">Dilla</span> and Scot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page did not present any evi­dence at the
preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
remanded to the Court of First Instance where the fiscal filed <span class="GramE">an informa­tion</span> for robbery with homicide against Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the trial court rendered the judgment of conviction
already mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant Page contends that the trial court
erred (1) in relying on his repudiated confession, (2) in convicting him
although he was not identified by <span class="SpellE">Randolf</span> Scot, the
prosecution's eyewitness, and (3) in convicting him on the basis of weak
circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Prepeña</span>, who took Page's confession, testified on its <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>, the precinct commander,
and Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Manolito</span> Miranda and Jose <span class="SpellE">Elquiero</span>, the arresting officer, denied that Page was
maltreated while he was in the custody of the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">Page admitted that when he was brought before the muni­cipal
judge for the administration of the oath on his confession, he could have
complained to the latter about the alleged mal­treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not complain.</p>

<p class="BODY">His aunt, <span class="SpellE">Prudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Alupit</span>,
and his own lawyer visited him in jail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He allegedly confided to them that he was maltreated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He requested them to take action against the
policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not complain to the
proper authorities about the alleged mal­treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The learned trial court made a searching and conscientious
analysis of appellant's evidence on the alleged duress employed by the police
in extracting his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
concluded that the con­fession was voluntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no error in that conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page's confession, having been taken before
the new Constitution took effect, is ad­missible although the requisites in
section 20 of article IV were not observed (<span class="SpellE">Magtoto</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span>, L-37201-2, March 3, 1975, 63 SCRA 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Certain details found in the confession are strong indicia of its
authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page specified therein
that his residence was at 143 <span class="SpellE">Pildira</span> Street, an
address which jibes with the address in his school record (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
I); that his maternal surname is <span class="SpellE">Ubiña</span>; that he met <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> at four o'clock in the afternoon of February 13,
1972; that they went to <span class="SpellE">Camposano's</span> residence, where
he (Page) was given liquor by <span class="SpellE">Camposano's</span> father;
that he directed the driver to follow a certain route; that <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
was from <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>; that Page was acquainted with some
hoodlums, and that he (Page) was charged with theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These details would not have been embodied in
the confession had not Page freely disclosed them to the police.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that Scot
during the trial did not point to Page as the person who sat beside him on the
front seat of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and who pressed an open
knife at his neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testifying nine
months the after the occurrence, Scot could not remember the face of Page.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recalled only that <span class="GramE">Page'
s</span> hair was thick.</p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman Ruben Cruz Santiago, one of those who investigated
Page, testified that the latter was sporting long hair and looked like a hippie
at the time of the investigation (2 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> November 21,
1972).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The photographs of Page taken in
July, 1971, or about seven months before the holdup, when Page was booked for
theft, show that he had long hair (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G).</p>

<p class="BODY">Scot's failure to identify Page during the trial is of no moment
because the crucial fact is that Page in his own confes­sion admitted his
participation in the holdup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page stated
in his confession:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Scot' s</span> testimony and the necropsy
report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) <span class="GramE">prove</span> the <u>corpus
<span class="SpellE">delicti</span></u> or the fact that robbery with homicide
was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page's extrajudicial
confession was corroborated by the evidence on the <u>corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span></u> (Sec. 3, Rule 133, <span class="GramE">Rules</span>
of Court).</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Appellant'
s</span> third contention that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable
doubt, because the prosecution' s evi­dence is mainly circumstantial, is not
meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once it is conceded, that his confession is voluntary, then there
cannot be any doubt as to his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have already shown that his confession was not vitiated by compul­sion or
constraint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alibi, which Page interposed during the trial and which his
counsel did not bother to discuss in his brief, appears to be a complete
fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page testified that at the
time of the commission of the holdup, he was residing with his aunt at 26 <span class="SpellE">Simbo</span> Street, Fort <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rizal</span></span>
and that he was sick.</p>

<p class="BODY">That testimony was squarely belied by Page's school record (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I) <span class="GramE">which</span> shows that, when the
holdup was per­petrated, he was residing with his father at 143 <span class="SpellE">Pildira</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City near
the airport (or at 101 Interior Rivera Village near the airport, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H) <span class="GramE">and</span> that on February 11,
1972, or two days before the holdup was committed, he was not sick because on
that date he was not absent from school.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, even if he was a <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
resident at the time of the holdup, that would not have precluded his partici­pation
in the commission of that offense at <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paraña­que</span>, which is not very far from Fort <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To establish an alibi, the accused must show that he was in
another place for such a period of time that it was impossible for him to have been
at the place where the crime was committed at the time of its commission
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Resa­yaga</span>, L-23234, December 26, 1973, 54
SCRA 350, 354).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page's alibi does not
satisfy that requirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The more important point to consider is whether the trial court
correctly ruled that Page, as a fellow conspirator of <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>,
could be held liable for robbery with homicide or for robbery only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his letters to this Court, Page, not being
a lawyer and not knowing the rules on conspiracy, insisted that he had nothing
to do with the death of Veronica <span class="SpellE">Villaverde-Balacapo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, it was <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> alone who
directly brought about Veronica's death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether Veronica jumped whether from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
as testified by Scot, or whether <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> kicked and
pushed her and her sister, <span class="SpellE">Cesarea</span>, out of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, as stated by Page in his confession, <span class="SpellE">Camposano's</span> culpability for that flagitious deed cannot be
disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">If Veronica jumped out of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
it must have been because she was in mortal dread that <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
would shoot her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As fear gripped
Veronica, she, in desperation, thought of scampering out of the moving <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her head
struck the pavement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was broken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A hemorrhage ensued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She died before medical assistance could be
extended to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that if a man creates in another person's mind an
immediate sense of danger, which causes such person to try to escape, and, in
so doing, the latter injures himself, the man who creates such a state of mind
is responsible for the resulting injuries (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Toling</span>,
L-27097, January 17, 1975, 62 SCRA 17, 33).</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the trial court's conclusion as to conspi­racy is
borne out by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> were boyhood friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About six hours before the crime was
committed, they were already together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were in the <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span> <span class="SpellE">rotonda</span>
at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> in the evening
or shortly before the holdup <span class="GramE">was</span> committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They boarded the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
in that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, they coordinated their actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They directed the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driver to go near the airport or in the vicinity of <span class="GramE">Page' s</span>
residence, a place which was well-known to the two malefactors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left the <span class="SpellE">jeep­ney</span>
together and fled in the same direction.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is not a scintilla of doubt that a conspiracy to commit
robbery existed between Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the two armed themselves with
deadly weapons, a knife and a revolver, signified that they were determined to
kill their victims in order to consummate their nefarious objective.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
acts reveal that they had agreed to commit robbery inside a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> (Art. 8, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court may take judicial notice that that
kind of robbery has been frequently committed since the liberation when the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> came into existence as a public con­veyance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> implemented their
agreement when they waited for a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> at
the <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span> <span class="SpellE">rotonda</span> and
boarded it at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they had
no evil intention, they could have sat together at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, they did not do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, as previously planned by them,
Page took the front seat so that he could control the driver and at the same
time extort money from him and the other passenger in the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> took a
seat at the back of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> so that he could rob
the two female passengers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The behavior of Page and <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>
inside the <span class="SpellE">jeep­ney</span> disclosed a synchronization of
their actions, evincing a prior concert and plan to commit robbery with
violence against and intimidation of persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Page should answer for all the consequences of the conspiracy, including
the homi­cide which was intertwined with the robbery committed by his
co-conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The homicide was
committed on the occasion or by reason of the robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that where the conspiracy to commit robbery was
conclusively shown by the concurrent and coor­dinate acts of the accused, and
homicide was committed as a consequence, or on the occasion, of the robbery,
all of the accused are guilty of <span class="SpellE"><u>robo</u></span><u> con <span class="SpellE">homicidio</span></u> whether or not they actually participated in
the killing (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>, 98 Phil. 5; People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, L-31594, April 29, 1974, 56 SCRA 659, 663).</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, when <span class="SpellE"><u>robo</u></span><u> con <span class="SpellE">homicidio</span></u> has been proven, all those who had taken part
in the robbery are guilty of the special complex crime unless it appears that
they endeavored to prevent the homicide (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Macalalad</span>, 9 Phil. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same rule is followed in Spanish
jurisprudence:</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be added that the presence of Page in the front seat,
armed with a <span class="SpellE"><u>balisong</u></span>, must have emboldened <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> to threaten Veronica <span class="SpellE">Balacapo</span>
and to cause her death with impunity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court failed to order the accused to pay the sum of P95

years old, the child of estranged parents (he lived with his father), who at
the age of eighteen years, was implica­ted in robbery with homicide,
undoubtedly by reason of poverty, should ordinarily excite some sympathy and
might evoke compas­sionate justice.</p>
