<p class="BODY">Luzon Stevedoring Corporation received a copy of the aforesaid
Order Amending Original Decision, subject of the appeal, on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1974</st1:date>, and, therefore, it
had a period of thirty (30) days from said date, or until <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1975</st1:date>, within which to perfect an
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1974, Luzon Stevedoring Corporation filed with
the trial court a notice of appeal, a cash appeal bond and a motion for
extension of time to file record on appeal, asking for fifteen (15) days from
January 3, 1975, or until January 18, 1975, within which to file the same, on
the ground of "pressure of work".</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 7, 1975, petitioner filed its opposition to the
extension and moved to dismiss the appeal and for issuance of a Writ of
Execution, contending that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
motion for extension was a "useless piece of paper", because it was
not addressed to adverse party and had not been set for hearing; (2) the reason
given does not justify the extension; and (3) the filing of the record on appeal
within the thirty-day period from notice of judgment is mandatory under Section
3, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court, and the filing of a motion for
extension of time does not <i>ipso facto</i> suspend the period of appeal, citing

and, therefore, Luzon Stevedoring Corporation not having perfected its appeal
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of thirty (30) days,
the decision sought to be appealed had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the Order of the court requiring the
petitioner to submit proof of service of its motion, petitioner filed its
"Compliance and Manifestation" on January 31, 1975, attaching thereto
the registry receipt and the return card of said motion and manifesting to the
court that "the extended period prayed for would have expired last January
18, 1975 but up to this date, January 21, 1975, no record on appeal appears to
have been filed."</p>

<p class="BODY">This manifestation notwithstanding, the trial court, on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1975</st1:date>, issued an Order

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of said Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1975</st1:date>, contending that
Luzon Stevedoring Corporation's appeal had not been duly perfected within the
period prescribed by law and the trial court had no longer any power to extend
the time for the perfection of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simultaneously, petitioner also filed an urgent <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></i> motion to defer the hearing on the record on

the trial court reset the hearing of the record on appeal to <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1975</st1:date>, on which date said
court also gave Luzon Stevedoring Corporation until the next day to file its
written opposition to petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 20, 1975, Luzon Stevedoring Corporation filed its
opposition, stating that its motion for extension of time to file the record on
appeal was not acted upon due to the retirement of the incumbent judge, and said
motion for extension was acted upon only on February 4, 1975 by Judge Rafael S.
<span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, to whom the case was reassigned, and that the
appeal is not dilatory nor frivolous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1975</st1:date>, petitioner
filed its reply to said opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1975</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an Order dismissing the appeal of Luzon Stevedoring
Corporation, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the Record on Appeal was filed only on
February 8, 1975, or a good twenty-one (21) days after and further, considering
that <span style="">from January 18, 1975, defendant
had not even filed any motion for extension of time to file the Record on Appeal,
the appeal has not been perfected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Section 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, to perfect an appeal, an appellant
must file and serve a notice of appeal, a Record on Appeal, and an appeal bond
within thirty (30) days from notice of judgment otherwise, the appeal is not
perfected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even a motion for
extension of time to perfect an appeal does not suspend the running of the
period sought to be extended.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE"><i>propio</i></span> reconsidered its Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1975</st1:date> on the ground of
"oversight" and approved Luzon Stevedoring Corporation's record on
appeal, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon going over the record of this case, this Court thru
oversight issued an order dated May 26, 1975 dismissing defendant's record on

from date hereof; the Court <span class="SpellE"><i>motu</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i>propio</i></span> and in the exercise of its sound discretion
reconsiders its order of May 26, 1975 and hereby approves defendant's record on

<p class="BODY">After the case was elevated to the respondent Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner filed, on September 8, 1975, a motion to dismiss the appeal, on the
grounds that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the appeal has not

reiterating its principal reason in its motion to dismiss, i.e., that the Court

beyond the period provided by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1975</st1:date>,

asked for an extension until January 18, 1975, this motion was not acted upon
until February 4, 1975, and the order granted appellant five days from February

(should be February 8, 1975), or within the extended period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court may act upon the motion for
extension and grant it even if at the time of the order the original period had
already expired."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary
injunction, which raises in issue the authority of the trial court to extend
the period for filing the record on appeal within five (5) days from February
4, 1975, or on February 9, 1975, notwithstanding the absence of any motion by
appellant, before the expiration of the period prescribed by law, to extend the
period to file the record on appeal, beyond January 18, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for by petitioner, this Court
issued on <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1976</st1:date>, a
temporary restraining order against the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the rules, in order to perfect an appeal, the appellant
must file with the trial court and serve upon the adverse party a notice of
appeal, a record on appeal, and an appeal bond within thirty (30) days from
notice of order or judgment, otherwise the appeal is considered not duly
perfected.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it should be noted that Luzon Stevedoring
Corporation received on December 4, 1974 a notice of the Order of November 27,
1974 of the trial court amending original decision, subject of the appeal, so
that as appellant it had a period of thirty (30) days from service of the
order, or until January 3, 1975, within which to perfect its appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that on December 27, 1974, Luzon
Stevedoring Corporation filed with the trial court a notice of appeal, a cash
appeal bond and a motion for extension of fifteen (15) days from January 3,
1975, or until January 18, 1975, within which to file its record on appeal, but
Luzon Stevedoring Corporation failed to file any record on appeal within the
requested extension period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also
undisputed that private respondent did not file any motion for the extension of
the period requested, which expired on <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
question that "the court has power and discretion to extend the period for
filing the record on appeal in the interest of justice, if it appears that the
appellant has not sufficient time to prepare and file it within the period
limited by law, either because the remaining period is very short, or the
record on appeal voluminous, or because of some other <i>justifiable reason</i>,
provided the motion for extension is filed before the expiration of the period
fixed by law."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
This power of the court to extend the period exists only if the motion to
extend is filed <i>prior</i> to the expiration of the period prescribed by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has always been the
consistent ruling of this Court that while the period within which the record
on appeal and appeal bond should be perfected and filed may be extended by
order of the court, the application for extension should be made <i>prior</i>
to the expiration of the original period.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It is evident from the foregoing that the court has authority to extend the
period for perfecting the appeal on two (2) conditions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the motion for extension must be filed <i>prior</i>
to the expiration of the period prescribed by law; and (2) such motion should
be supported by justifiable reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first condition is predicated upon the fact that once the period prescribed
expires and no record on appeal has yet been filed, the court loses
jurisdiction to approve the extension, unless the delay is due to fraud,
accident, mistake or excusable negligence.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, it is the duty of appellant to ascertain the status of his motion, for
if no action is taken thereon or is denied after the lapse of the period, the
right to appeal is lost.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The second is based on the settled rule that while the trial court may, in its
discretion, extend the time for appeal beyond the period fixed by law, it must
be satisfactorily shown that there is a justifiable reason for such action,
like fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence, or similar supervening
causality, without the fault on the part of the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, not only has Luzon Stevedoring Corporation failed to file any motion for
extension of the period for filing the record on appeal after <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1975</st1:date>, but what is more,
there appears to be no justifiable reason to warrant the action of the judge in
extending such period after the same had already expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the trial court is vested with discretion to
allow or admit an appeal filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this discretion is not unconditional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a legal justification to
warrant such action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <i>Reyes
v. Court of Appeals, et al</i>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court enjoined the Court of Appeals from taking cognizance of the
appeal on the ground that the record on appeal was not filed within the
thirty-day period provided by the rules, this Court explained that
"interest of justice" cannot be invoked against the rule unless there
is lawful justification.</p>

<blockquote>"* * * When we said that 'it was not mandatory but, if at all,
purely discretionary in their respondent judge to approve or disapprove it in
the interest of justice' we did not mean that a judge is vested with discretion
to approve a record on appeal presented out of time without legal
justification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, if in that
case <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> had filed the record on appeal on <st1:date year="1942" day="23" month="1">Jan<span style="">uary
 23, 1942</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
respondent judge would have been justified in admitting it although it was filed
beyond the thirty-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, for the
reason that on account of war the office of the clerk of court was closed
before said date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, in the
absence of any justifying circumstance the court has no discretion to approve
or admit an appeal filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The interest of justice cannot be invoked against the rule unless there
is lawful justification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
intervention of such circumstance as the law recognizes as a valid reason for
relaxing the rule -- fraud, accident, mistake, excusable negligence that
creates the ‘interest of justice’ in favor of the victim of the
circumstance." (At pp. 237-238.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the private respondent cannot invoke the inaction of
the court as a justification for having a longer period.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court emphasized in various cases, it was the duty of the appellant to
ascertain from the Clerk of Court the status of the motion for extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had it followed this elementary precaution,
private respondent could have known the absence of the judge in Branch XIII to
act on its motion, in which event it was its duty to present the same motion
for the approval of the judge of the Court of First Instance of Branch XIV, the
<span class="SpellE">sala</span> assigned, under the internal rules of the Court
of First Instance of Manila, to act on motions pertaining to Branch XIII in the
absence of the incumbent judge therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Luzon Stevedoring Corporation, however, argues
that it filed this record on appeal within the period granted by the trial
court in its Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1975</st1:date>
and it does not have to plead fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence
to secure approval of its record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This argument fails to consider the circumstance that at the time when
the trial court issued its Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1975</st1:date>, the period to file the record on appeal had already
expired, hence the trial court had no longer any authority to grant the
extension, as there was no longer any period to extend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compliance with the period provided by law
for the perfection of an appeal is not merely mandatory but it is
jurisdictional requirement, and failure to perfect an appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period renders the judgment of the court
final.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the respondent Court of Appeals

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur fully in the very able main opinion of Mr. Justice
Antonio, and I would like to add a few words in justification of the judgment
reversing the resolutions here in question of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted by herein respondent Luzon Stevedoring Company
that apart from its motion filed on <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="12">December
 27, 1974</st1:date> for the extension of its period to file its record on
appeal up to <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1975</st1:date>,
it did not file any other motion for further extension of said period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it allowed the very period it
had itself fixed for the filing of its record on appeal to expire without
taking any step to file the same, and the only explanation it can give for such
omission is that the court had not yet acted on its motion for extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I consider such an excuse puerile, specious
and totally lacking in candor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
more, it shows very little respect for the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a party asks for an extension of the
period to file a jurisdictional paper and fixes within the limits of the rules
the day it would actually do such filing, it becomes its inescapable duty to
act within the period thus fixed by itself, should the court for one reason or
another fail to act within such period, for although the court may act on his
motion and grant it even after the period has expired, it cannot, when it comes
to the filing of a record on appeal, grant him more time than he has asked for,
once the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period together with the
extension asked for has already expired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is settled that a trial court cannot extend the period for appeal
after it has already expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the
appellant does not even have to check on whether or not his motion for
extension has been granted, for even if he assumes that it has been or would be
favorably acted upon, there is no warrant at all for any expectation on his
part that the court would act in excess of its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if his motion is denied
there is nothing else he can do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
discretion of the court under Section 7 of Rule 11 to extend periods for filing
even after their expiration refers exclusively to the filing of answers and
other pleadings the filing of which has no jurisdictional import.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides a record on appeal is not a pleading
within the concept of Rule 6.</p>

<p class="BODY">In regard to these postulations, I might observe that
respondent's counsel cannot say that he has been caught unaware.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, according to the record,
petitioner had repeatedly and consistently opposed the approval of respondent's
appeal in the trial court from the very inception of the latter's effort in
that direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, in
January of 1975 when all the incidents in question took place, counsel have <span class="GramE">by</span> then read already or learned of the Court's ruling in <span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span>, cited in the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therein the concurring opinion of this writer
in Sta. Maria, also relied upon by Mr. Justice Antonio here, was adopted approvingly
by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These decisions were
handed down way back in <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="11">November 20,
 1972</st1:date> (Sta. Maria) and <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="9">September
 28, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span>), or at least more
than a year before respondent here attempted to make the appeal in
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore no excuse
for counsel to have ignored the following unequivocal explanation of the points
now under discussion:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
the case of Reyes v. Sta. Maria, L-29554, November 20, 1972, We held that if
the motion for extension filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period is not acted upon and the extension period asked for lapses without the
record on appeal having been filed, the motion did not suspend the running of
the period and the right to appeal is lost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the concurring opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
joined by the then Chief Justice, is very pertinent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'As long as the motion is filed within the original period, the
court does not lose its jurisdiction to act on it even after the expiration of
said period, but in such an event, the appellant assumes the risk of denial,
for if the motion is denied, and such denial takes place after the period for
appeal has already lapsed, the filing of the motion is not considered as having
suspended said period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the
motion is granted, then the appeal may be deemed as made timely, provided the
corresponding notice of appeal have been filed within the prescribed period.'</p>

<blockquote>"He went on to say:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Similarly, the mere filing within the original period for appeal
of a motion for extension of time to submit the record on appeal would not have
the effect of extending the period for appeal if such motion is denied after
the period has already lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>However,
if the motion is granted, the extension requested is tacked to the original
period, even IF THE FAVORABLE ORDER IS ISSUED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE
LATTER.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event the record on
appeal must be filed within the extension asked<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(which petitioner in this case complied with), for once said period
expires and no record on appeal has yet been filed, the court loses
jurisdiction to approve the extension unless the delay is due to fraud,
accident, mistake or excusable neglect</u>.' (Italics Suppli<span style="">ed)”</span> (53 SCRA, 233-234.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there is not the least indication that
respondent was impeded from filing its record on appeal on or before <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1975</st1:date> by any fraud,
accident, mistake or excusable neglect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My considered view is that here, We have a case of either simple
ignorance of the law or plain inattention, certainly inexcusable, to the
jurisdictional requirements laid down by the rules and in extant jurisprudence
in the procedure for appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in promulgating the
impugned resolutions which condoned and <span class="GramE">sanctioned,</span>
not only a grave abuse of discretion, but an actuation of the trial court
manifestly in excess of its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My vote is to grant the petition.</p>
