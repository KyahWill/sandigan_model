<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, Domingo 
<span class="SpellE">Balido</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span> or Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Romines</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escareal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eutiquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dultra</span> and Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> were charged with the murder of Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> on November 4, 1947, in an information which alleges 
evident premeditation and treachery, as qualifying circumstances and abuse of 
superior strength and taking advantage of their public positions, as aggravating 
circumstances. One <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> was not included in the information because he had 
since died. Accused <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span> was discharged from the information and utilized as a 
state witness. After due trial, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> rendered judgment finding accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> and 
Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> guilty of the crime charged, beyond 
reasonable doubt and imposed the penalty of <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></span></em>, the accessories of the law, to 
indemnify jointly and severally the heir of pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and 
to pay proportional costs; the other accused were acquitted. <span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Culled from the testimony of the 
state witnesses, Dr. Andres Corpus, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tingzon</span>, 
accused <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span>, 
Marcelo Escalante, Jaime Ballista, <span class="SpellE">Silvestra</span> <span class="SpellE">Balite</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Devora</span> and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dato</span> and other evidence of record, are the following 
facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> <span class="GramE">were</span> the Mayor and Chief of Police, respectively, on or 
before </span><st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 4, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, in 
the town of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bobon</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, while their co-accused were 
policemen thereof. In the morning of </span><st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 4, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
accused, led by accused <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, constructed a roadblock across the provincial road 
at the entrance to the town of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bobon</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, coming from <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span> and near the houses of <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Duran and Jose <span class="SpellE">Orawa</span>. 
Between </span><st1:time hour="14" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2:00</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and </span><st1:time hour="15" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3:00 
o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
in the afternoon, same day, the accused gathered at the parking place for 
passenger buses in <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span>, in front of the house of 
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Balite</span>, in order to intercept the passenger 
buses coming from <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>. Accused <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> harangued his co-accused, thus: "You policemen, 
watch the buses from <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span> for Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> might come; if you see him in the bus shoot him 
immediately; don't be afraid because I am responsible for you; the 
administration is ours, up and down; if you will not shoot him, I will shoot 
you; this Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> is an obstacle to my 
administration; he is a beast; it was yet in <span class="SpellE">Carangian</span> 
that I wanted to liquidate him but I had no chance." In similar vein, accused 
<span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> told his men that "Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> deserves to be killed because he is an obstacle to the 
administration." <span class="GramE">The accused then deployed around the parking 
place.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A passenger bus, on coming to the 
roadblock, slowed down. Among the passengers of the bus were Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> and state witness Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tingzon</span>. On entering the town and before reaching the 
parking place, accused policeman <span class="SpellE">Eutiquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dultra</span> boarded the bus at the rear and poked his Thompson on 
the nape of driver Jaime Ballista, at whose right side and next to him was 
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>. Pat. <span class="SpellE">Dultra</span> 
ordered the driver to stop the bus; the driver slowed down and parked the 
vehicle in front of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Balite's</span> house. While 
the bus was parking, accused <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> pistol in hand, 
with his index finger on the trigger, approached the bus from the rear and 
inquired whether "<span class="SpellE">Atoy</span> was there" (referring to Pastor 
<span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>). Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was 
alighting from the bus and upon reaching the ground, threw his hands off in the 
air, saying, "<span class="SpellE">Diri</span> <span class="SpellE">aco</span> <span class="SpellE">ma'ato</span> <span class="SpellE">saiyo</span>" (I will not fight 
against you), addressing <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> at whose back were 
accused policemen Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>. At this juncture, 
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> with a .45 cal. revolver in hand came 
up to the bus running from the store of Chinaman Pablo opposite the store of 
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Balite</span>, shouting: "Fire, fire, it was yet before 
that I ordered to you to fire immediately." Accused Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, seconded the order to fire. Accused <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Martial <span class="SpellE">Giray</span></span></em> 
fired his carbine hitting Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> in the left 
breast, causing him to spin and to drop slowly to the ground, <span class="SpellE">broaning</span>. While <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was thus 
sprawled, Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> again shouted fire and accused 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span></span></em> fired at <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> 
after making the remark that they had long wanted to get him. <span class="SpellE">Miano's</span> shot hit <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> on the left 
shoulder. Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> died on the 
spot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Immediately after <span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> death, <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> ordered the search of his body, for any weapon. 
Accused policeman <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> made the search and found no weapon of any kind in 
<span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> inert body. The cadaver was brought to the 
municipal building upon order of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>. 
Driver of the bus, Jaime Ballista, after changing tires, resumed his trip to 
<span class="SpellE">Carangian</span>, with <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Miano</span>, among his passengers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Dr. Andres Corpus, performed the 
autopsy on the cadaver and found four gunshot wounds caused by a .30 cal. 
bullet, two entrance wounds and two exit wounds. One entrance wound was above 
the left nipple, the bullet causing it, came out of the back, right side; the 
second wound was at the left deltoid region, the bullet causing it, came out 
also, at the back right side, but on a different spot from that of the first 
exit wound. Both wounds were fatal because they both involved the heart and the 
lungs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The defense presented as 
witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, 
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span>, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Romines</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> de <span class="SpellE">Asas</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eutiquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dultra</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>. 
Their story runs as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At </span><st1:time hour="9" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">9:00 
o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
in the morning of </span><st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 4, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> (now deceased) 
complained to Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> that <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>, carbine in hand, pursued him early that same morning. 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Pat. <span class="SpellE">Miano</span></span></em> was instructed by Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> to look for and disarm <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> or to bring him to office. At about </span><st1:time hour="16" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">4:00 
p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> that 
day, Agustin armed with carbine went to the parking place in front of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Balite's</span> house. Sometime after, a passenger bus from <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span> came and <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was aboard 
the same. Agustin asked <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> to come down, telling 
him that he had something to talk to him. <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> 
alighted and Agustin took him to some distance from the bus and informed him 
that someone reported to the Police Chief that he had a pistol. <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> denied, whereupon, and coming from behind him (<span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>) <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> searched the body of <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> 
and shouted: "No, don't believe him; he has a revolver, here it is" (<span class="SpellE">Giray</span> feeling the waist of <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>). 
Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> drew his pistol and tried to cock it, 
but <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> held <span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> hand 
that bore the pistol. While struggling for the possession of the pistol, <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> kicked <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> and <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> was thrown off the front and <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> immediately cocked his pistol and fired upon <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> but missed him. When <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> 
saw <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> drew his pistol, he warned: "Don't do it; I 
am an authority" and instantly retreated to a distance of 2 meters from <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>, afraid that pistol would explode." <span class="GramE">When <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was attempting to cock his 
pistol for the second time, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> drew his 
carbine and fired upon <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>, causing the latter to 
twist his body towards him (<span class="SpellE">Miano</span>). In this position, 
<span class="SpellE">Miano</span> fired a second shot, hitting <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> on the left lower breast and <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> dropped to the ground. Pat. <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> picked up <span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> pistol and 
brought <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> in the direction of the municipal 
building. <span class="GramE">Upon reaching the corner of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span> <span class="SpellE">Niño</span> and San Ignacio 
streets, near the warehouse of Chinaman Pablo, they met Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> who was on his way to the place of the gunfire, 
after hearing them in his office. <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> inquired 
from Pat. <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> what the shooting was all about. Pat. 
<span class="SpellE">Miano</span> informed him: "Sir, I shot Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> and here is his pistol and the man (<span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>) with whom he 
(Pastor) fought." <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> then delivered the revolver to 
Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, who locked the chamber thereof with the 
safety lock, because the revolver was .cocked with one bullet in the chamber. 
The three (<span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>) went back to the scene of the killing. 
Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> ordered policemen <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Camposano</span> and Pastor <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> to take the dead body to the municipal building. 
Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> investigated <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>, putting their 
statements in writing but not sworn to, after which investigation, he (<span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>) entered in the police blotter the following: 
"Municipal policeman Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> shot to death 
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>; according to my investigation policeman 
Agustin is justified for according to my opinion he did it in the performance of 
his duty". Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, on </span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 5, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
delivered to P.C. Sgt. Santiago <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> revolver, entering in the police blotter that fact 
and P.C. Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> signed in the police blotter 
acknowledging receipt thereof. Lieut. <span class="SpellE">Trimio</span> also 
investigated policeman <span class="SpellE">Miano</span>, the day following the 
incident and Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> delivered to said 
lieutenant the written declarations of <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The defense also alleged that 
<span class="SpellE">Giray</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> Rosita 
was not a policeman at or before the time of the shooting and accused <span class="SpellE">Dultra</span> was no longer a policeman on November 4, 1947, having 
resigned in January or February, 1947; the police force of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> had only 1 carbine, 1 Thompson and 1 Thompson <span class="SpellE">submachinegun</span>, and the last two on November 4, 1947, could 
not be used, as they were defective - could not fire - and that Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> did not have any .45 caliber pistol, and he would 
only borrow the colt-revolver of the municipal treasurer, <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> he needed firearm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accused Mayor <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> asserted that the first time he came to know of the 
shooting was at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the day in question, when 
he went down the municipal building from his office, because the people were 
talking about it; that he ordered Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> to 
investigate policeman <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> and then went home to San 
Jose. Accused <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> simply branded as false, all 
the testimonies of the government witnesses in the case against 
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this instance, appellants 
submit that the trial court committed error-<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) In finding: appellant Agustin 
<span class="SpellE">Miano</span> guilty of the crime charged, notwithstanding the 
presence of all elements of self-defense and defense of stranger duly 
established by the said appellants;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) In finding the appellants 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> guilty of the crime charged, as co-principals, by 
induction; notwithstanding the failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt 
beyond reasonable doubt;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(3) In considering political 
persecution as the motive of the killing and discarding the motive in the 
persecution of defendants-appellants;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(4) In not believing that <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was armed with a .45 caliber pistol when he was shot 
by Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">All of which boil down to the 
question of credibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is almost trite to be 
repeating here, that as far as the credibility and veracity of witnesses are 
concerned, the conclusions of the lower court command great weight and respect, 
on the ground that the trustworthiness of witnesses and the merit of the 
defenses by the accused, are within the peculiar province of the trial court. We 
are of the firm belief that the incident in question, occurred in the manner as 
narrated by the witnesses for the State and as found by the trial court. 
Appellant Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span>, having admitted to have fired 
the two mortal shots upon the victim Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>, it 
is incumbent upon him to adduce by clear and positive proofs that he acted in 
his own defense and in the defense of a stranger. (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ansoyon</span>, 75 Phil. 772-777.) This, in our opinion, appellant 
<span class="SpellE">Miano</span> has failed to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Two questions arise from <span class="SpellE">Miano's</span> defense: (1) Whether or not <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> had a pistol with which he allegedly used in shooting 
<span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>; and (2) 
Granting in <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">gratia</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">argumenti</span></span></em>, 
that <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> had a pistol, did he use it in shooting 
<span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The learned trial court found a 
paucity of convincing evidence that <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> ever had a 
pistol. We share this conclusion. Police Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> 
claims that he entered in his police blotter the fact that he delivered <span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> revolver to P.C. Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> at about </span><st1:time hour="10" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">10:00 
o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
in the morning of </span><st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1947"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 5, 
1947</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
police blotter was, however, not presented, for according to the defense, the 
same is now missing. Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> declared that at 
</span><st1:time hour="10" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">10:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of November 4 (not November 5), 
he received a <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">pistol</span></em> (not a 
revolver) from Chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, giving him a receipt 
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>. The receipt was not also presented in court. 
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> further declared that he turned over this 
pistol to Sgt. Julio Garcia, for delivery to the provincial headquarters at 
<span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, Sgt. Garcia giving him a receipt for that 
pistol. Again, the alleged receipt of Sgt. Garcia was not produced, on the 
explanation of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> that he lost it. Sgt. 
Garcia, subpoenaed by the defense to appear </span><st1:date month="11" day="2" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 2, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
showed up in court on said date, he was not placed on the witness stand, with 
the explanation of counsel for the defense, Attys. Del Valle <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Robadulla</span></span><span class="GramE">, 
that</span> Sgt. Garcia could not remember whether Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> delivered any pistol to him. This creates the 
unfavorable presumption that had Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> declared 
his testimony would have been adverse to the defense. The manifestation of 
defense attorneys to the trial court that they would produce the records in the 
provincial headquarters showing the existence of <span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> <span class="GramE">firearm,</span> did not pass 
beyond a mere manifestation. The truth was that, according to Sgt. Garcia's 
admission to the Provincial Fiscal, he did not receive any pistol from Sgt. 
<span class="SpellE">Dogan</span>, but that he (Sgt. Garcia) was not in <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, in those days but 
in <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> Province. The flimsy explanations of these 
intelligent witnesses with respect to the vanishing receipts and documents, and 
material discrepancies found in their testimonies, simply show that the alleged 
pistol of <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> did not exist. And, in the face of the 
clear and positive testimony of the State witnesses Domingo <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span>, Marcelo Escalante and <span class="SpellE">Silvestra</span> <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> that when <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was lying dead on the ground, his body was searched by 
the policeman, but no weapon was found, the contrary testimony of the above 
defense witnesses, fizzles into thin air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Conceding for a moment, that 
<span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> had a pistol, did he use it in shooting <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>? <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> wanted the court to 
believe that <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> drew his pistol; attempted to cock 
it, followed by the struggle between him (<span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>) and 
<span class="SpellE">Giray</span> for the possession of the pistol; kicked off 
<span class="SpellE">Giray</span>; then fired upon <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>; and then attempted to cock his pistol for the second 
time. If this were true, <span class="GramE">We</span> are really led to great 
wonderment to find that <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>, the latter specially, had not received a single 
scratch. If, as contended, <span class="SpellE">Giray</span> was not a policeman 
at the time, then it was not his concern to embrace <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> from behind, and tell <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> 
to search him, with his aid. It would appear that the provocation started from 
<span class="SpellE">Giray</span> and <span class="SpellE">Miano</span>. Knowing, as 
alleged, that in the morning in question, <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> had a 
firearm, it is not explained why a search warrant was not carried by the 
policeman, in order to <span class="GramE">effect</span> <span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> arrest that afternoon. Defense witness <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> claim that he saw 
from his house when <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> alighted from the bus and 
<span class="SpellE">Moyot's</span> alleged struggle with <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>. According to <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dato</span>, however, he and <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, from </span><st1:time hour="11" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">11:00 
a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of 
November 4 to the following morning, November 5, were in barrio 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Rosario</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span>, to hold a political meeting in the evening of 
November 4.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to the motive of the killing, 
it is worthwhile to reproduce hereunder what the learned trial judge has said 
about the matter:-<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court does not doubt that 
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was killed because of his political 
activities. He was one of the strong supporters of the NP and he was outspoken 
in his attack against the local administration which was then in the hands of 
defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> then mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span> with Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> as his 
chief of police. As a matter of fact government witness Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> heard defendants Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> in 
front of her house say to their co-defendants that Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was the only obstacle to the administration. It is 
true that government witnesses Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tingzon</span>, 
Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> are strong leaders of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party but the Court cannot agree that for this 
alone they would incriminate defendants Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and chief <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> in such 
a heinous offense as that charged against them in the case at bar, if really 
these defendants were not <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">particen</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">criminis</span></span></em>. If 
these government witnesses were only politically inspired, they would have 
incriminated too <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Duran who was already the 
LP mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bobon</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and who defeated NP candidate 
<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dato</span> in the elections 
of 1947. Defense would want to impeach witness Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tingzon</span> by presenting his affidavit <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 22 (translation, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 22-a) 
wherein Antonio allegedly made no mention of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Homines</span> in the 
commission of the felony, but instead Mentioned <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenera</span>, who was then in 
<span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>. The Court however, believes that the 
attempted impeachment did not prosper confrontation. And even if the Court were 
to discard the testimonies of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> and 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tingzon</span>, there remains still sufficient 
evidence on record showing the participation of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> in 
the commission of the felony. The testimonies of Jaime Ballista, (the driver of 
the Passenger bus which carried Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>) Marcelo 
Escalante and defendant <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span> (or Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span>) 
clearly established the participation of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> 
and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> in the commission of the 
felony. Defense tried to impeach the credibility of Marcelo Escalante, a <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Veteran with alleged previous contradictory 
statements made in his affidavit <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2 but again the 
attempted impeachment must fail for lack of confrontation. In addition the 
alleged contradiction refers to a very minor detail. The Court finds no evidence 
on record sufficient to discredit Jaime Ballista and <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Devora</span> and the other 
government's witnesses and the Court cannot believe that they would incriminate 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> in such a serious crime as murder if really they did 
not see these two defendants take part in the commission of the felony. The 
alibi of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> must yield to the positive statements of the 
government witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Little need be added to the above 
illuminating exposition, except to state that the same is fully supported by the 
evidence of record. <span class="GramE">Motive or no motive, the stubborn fact 
remains that reliable eye-witnesses testified to the circumstances of the 
killing.</span> They saw the actual killing. The defense admitted the killing, 
only that it imputes the same upon one only, (<span class="SpellE">Miano</span>) 
who, like the biblical and good Simon of the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cyrene</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, offered to shoulder the cross 
alone, in an endeavor to save the skin, so to say, of the other accused. Truth 
to tell, these days, there is such a decay in civic and moral virtues, that even 
in broad daylight, people shoot and kill others, as if they are shooting wild 
duck in the swamps, just for the fun or sake of killing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Anent the conclusion and 
inference that the delay in the prosecution of the crime is unreasonable and 
reflects insincerity of the witnesses against appellants, it was explained that 
the affidavit of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tingzon</span> was taken in 1949 
only, because he was afraid of the threat to him that if one would tell the 
truth, he would get hurt; that in the preliminary investigation of the case, 
first instituted in 1949, appellant <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> entered 
the court room and issued a threat that: "Anyone who will make foolishness, 
shoot him, don't be afraid", which threat cowed and imposed silence upon the 
government witnesses; that Marcelo Escalante who is a <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> veteran did not testify until 2 years after the 
incident, because of the prevailing intimidation against anyone who would expose 
the appellants; that Jaime Ballista who was investigated on the following day of 
the incident and witness <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Devora</span> who was only 14 years at the time of the incident, 
did not come out in the open because they were also afraid of the threats of 
<span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> who 
during those days in said town were according to them, the owners of the 
administration "up and down"; the most powerful and the <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">factotum</span></em>, in their tiny bailiwick. 
"These witnesses shove off their fear only when President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> became the President of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and under whose administration 
protection could be availed of speedily by those who wanted to serve justice." 
These circumstances satisfactorily explain the delay in the prosecution of the 
instant case. (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Belendrez</span>, et al., 47 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 5134; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Alupay</span>, 85 Phil., 688; 47 Off.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 
4574.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Of course, after the rendition of 
the sentence, the appellants filed an amended motion for new trial dated 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="28" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 28, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
which was denied by the trial court because the appeal was already perfected. 
Another petition for new trial was presented in this Court on </span><st1:date month="3" day="9" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 9, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
which was ordered to be taken up when the case is decided on the merits. The 
alleged newly discovered and material evidence consists of (1) Affidavits of 
<span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, widow of 
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> (Annexes A and A-1, motion for new trial 
dated March 8, 1961); (2) Letter of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> Halite 
(Annex B); (3) Affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Celespara</span> (Annex C); (4) Letter of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Samoray</span> (Annex D); (5) 
Ante-Mortem Statement of Pastor <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> (Annex E); and 
(6) Police Blotter (Annex F).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(a) <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span> would have testified that she was instructed to file 
a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Baguiz</span> by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Balite</span>, but she was not 
interested because she knew that <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> had nothing to do with the killing of her husband. 
Her testimony can not alter the decision because she would be merely giving her 
own conclusion or opinion. How could she know that <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> had nothing 
to do with the killing, when she was not present during the incident? (b) The 
letter of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> addressed to <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> seems to imply that <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> 
had instructed <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span> to go to <span class="SpellE">Catubig</span> at a political rally and work for his (<span class="SpellE">Balite's</span>) candidacy, otherwise, he would request the P.C. to 
file any <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">frivolous charge</span></em> 
against him (<span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>), including <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>. One should not stretch his imagination, far and 
wide, to visualize that the letter is in itself "frivolous" and unbelievable, 
for, normally, no lawyer, like <span class="SpellE">Balite</span>, would write 
such a letter and incriminate himself, so flagrantly. It is addressed to one 
"<span class="SpellE">Edring</span>" and signed by "<span class="SpellE">Elad</span>". Who these persons are, or whether Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> had ever written this letter, one is really left to 
conjecture. At any rate, the letter, if true, can not alter the conclusions 
already reached by this court. (c) The affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Celespara</span> was offered to 
show that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> was bent on prosecuting the 
appellants, so much so that <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> had sent affiant to 
fetch <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> Rodriguez, then Chief of Police, whom 
<span class="SpellE">Balite</span> reprimanded for not having filed immediately 
the complaint against the appellants; that Rodriguez was hesitant in filing the 
complaint because he believed the killing was justified; and that the P.C. Sgt. 
<span class="SpellE">Dogan</span> had acknowledged receipt of the pistol, as shown 
by a police blotter in his office, which said Rodriguez delivered to <span class="SpellE">Balite</span> who brought it to <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>. 
This is not <span class="GramE">a newly</span> discovered evidence; it is merely a 
forgotten or Corroborative evidence, if at all, and could not serve as a factor 
to change the result of the case. (d) It is stated that <span class="SpellE">Celespara</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Voluntary 
to testify</span></em> after the sentence was promulgated. <span class="SpellE">Celespara</span> is one of those heroes, when the war is over. And 
one can easily see that his propose testimony, if true, is tailored to rebut the 
vital issue: existence or not of a pistol allegedly belonging to <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>. It is an impeaching evidence, (e) <span class="GramE">This</span> is addressed to "My dear <span class="SpellE">Asang</span>" signed by "<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Samoray</span>." Appellants want to show that <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, wife of <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was instructed by <span class="SpellE">Samoray</span>, 
by orders of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balite</span>, to see the latter at <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>, for the purpose of filing "the frivolous charge" 
against the appellants. Who is <span class="SpellE">Asang</span> and who <span class="GramE">is <span class="SpellE">Samoray</span></span> and whether or not <span class="SpellE">Samoray</span> had written this letter, only appellants can know. 
One thing is evident, however, and that is: this letter falls under the same 
pattern as letters Annexes A and A-1. (f) Appellants want to show that in this 
supposed <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ante-mortem</span></em> <span class="GramE">statement,</span> <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> resisted the 
arrest made by <span class="SpellE">Miano</span>; because <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> believed that it was Domingo <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> together with Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> 
(appellant) and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> who shot him in the 
night of </span><st1:date month="9" day="18" year="1946"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 18, 
1946</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> at 
about </span><st1:time hour="19" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">7:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> If this so-called <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ante-mortem</span></em> statement of <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> ever existed and it was taken before the Chief of 
Police then, (appellant <span class="SpellE">Cardeño</span>), it was not explained 
why the same was not presented by the appellants at the trial. This is again 
<span class="GramE">a forgotten</span> evidence. Moreover, there is no showing of 
the circumstances under which the statement was made and signed; who were 
present; who took it; who witnessed it; whether it was marked or signed. And if 
We should, as We do, take into account, that immediately after he received the 
shots, <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>, fell to the ground, lifeless and 
speechless, it is indeed extending Our credulity to the breaking point, if this 
belated move of the appellant to introduce this so-called <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ante mortem</span></em> statement of <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> should be allowed. (g) It appears from the police 
blotter that Agustin <span class="SpellE">Miano</span> had admitted the shooting 
of <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> by him, thus corroborating <span class="SpellE">Miano's</span> testimony that he was the one who shot <span class="SpellE">Moyot</span>, without receiving an order from anyone, and that 
<span class="SpellE">Moyot</span> was armed with a .45 cal. pistol. Come now the 
appellants and claim that after the rendition of the sentence-"a third party 
contacted the accused appellants and their counsel to offer this important piece 
of evidence". Who is this party? It is not shown. Who signed the blotter is not 
also indicated. And knowing, as they did, that this important piece of evidence 
existed, appellants should have left no stone unturned, to locate it. They only 
exercised diligence after the conviction, after gambling with the evidence for 
the prosecution. At any rate, the existence or not of this blotter, has already 
been fully treated in the early part of this opinion; and even if the same is 
presented now, it would not alter the conclusion reached by <span class="GramE">Us</span>, on the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view hereof, the motion for 
new <span class="GramE">trial,</span> is denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Newly discovered 
evidence</span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.-In 
order that a new trial may be granted on the ground of newly discovered 
evidence, the following requisites must be present: (a) that the evidence was 
discovered after the trial; (b) that such evidence could not have been 
discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable 
diligence, and (c) that it is material, not merely cumulative, corroborative or 
impeaching, and is of such weight that, if admitted, it will probably change the 
judgment. Accordingly, where the evidence was known to the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> and was obtainable at the trial, or if not known, it 
is not satisfactorily shown why it was not available at the trial, or that due 
diligence was not employed in securing it, the motion for new trial should be 
denied. So, also, where the evidence consists merely in improbable or 
unreasonable testimonies of witnesses, or is merely cumulative or corroborative, 
and will not thus alter the results, the motion will be denied. Forgotten 
evidence is not a ground for new trial, pp. 
297-298.)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
