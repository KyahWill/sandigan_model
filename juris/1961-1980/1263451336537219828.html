<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1960, the newly created Rice and Corn Board<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
issued Resolution No. 10, pursuant to Section <span style="">6 </span>of the <span style="">law, </span>defining the term "by-product" used in the law, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"By-product shall mean the secondary products resulting from
the process of husking, <span style="">grinding, milling, </span>and cleaning of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>

husk', 'corn drips’ and 'corn meals'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And on July 10, 1961, the RICOB issued
Gen. Circular No. <span style="">1, </span>as amended,
which defined the term "capital investment" used <span style="">in Section </span><span style="">3 </span>of Republic Act 3018 which limits
the maximum amount of capital investments of alien persons and entities engaged
in the rice and/or corn industry to the amount stated in their statement made
pursuant to Section 2 of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">These two circulars have been duly published and translated into
the local dialect pursuant to Section <span style="">6
</span>of Republic Act 3018.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, having been
required by agents of RICOB to register in accordance with Section 2 of the law
and the latter's resolution, dated January 3, 1961, ruling that manufacturers
and/or dealers of <span class="SpellE">bijon</span>, noodle, corn starch, <span class="SpellE">gawgaw</span>, rice wine, poultry feeds and other <span style="">by-products </span>of rice and corn are
covered by the law, filed <span style="">action </span>in
the Court of First Instance to declare <span style="">the
said </span>law and RICOB Resolution No. 10, Nov. 21, 1960 <span style="">and Gen. </span>Circular No. 1, July 10,
1961, as inapplicable to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending
trial on the merits, the lower court issued <span style="">the </span>writ of preliminary injunction prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">To abbreviate the proceedings, the parties entered into a
stipulation of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the
lower court rendered judgment (a) declaring Republic Act 3018 not applicable to
plaintiff's business; (b) declaring null and void <span class="SpellE">RICOB's</span>
Resolution No. 10, dated November 21, 1960 and General Circular No. 1, as
amended, dated July 10, 1961 <span style="">in </span>so far as they were and are being made applica­ble to
plaintiff's business and (c) making and declaring permanent and perpetual the
preliminary writ of injunc­<span style="">t</span>ion
issued in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the foregoing ruling, defendant RICOB, through
the Solicitor General, has taken the ins­tant appeal to raise questions purely
of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has stopped
from engaging in the purchase and sale of rice and/or corn since the lapse of
the two year period from the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the <span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It </span>has limited its activities to the <u>trade</u>, <u>processing</u>
and <u>manufacture</u> of corn and rice oil from raw materials consisting of
corn germ proper or embryo ("<span class="SpellE">sungo</span>") and
"<span class="SpellE">tahup</span>", as well as from rice husk which it
secures from others who mill rice and corn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the processing and manufacture of corn oil, plaintiff also produces a
residue called "corn meal" or "corn meal germ" which it
sells and trades.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are these activities
covered by Republic Act 3018?</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of the law defines "rice and/or corn
industry" as including the <u>handling of distribution</u>, either in
wholesale or retail, and <u>the acquisition for purpose of trade, of the
by-products</u> of rice and corn:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No person who is not a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
or association, part­nership or corporation, the capital or capital stock of
which is not wholly owned by ci­tizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
shall directly or indirectly engage in the rice and/or corn in­dustry except <span style="">as </span>provided
in Section three of this Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As used in this Act, <u>the term 'rice and/ or corn industry'
shall mean and include the</u> culture, milling, warehousing, <u>transporting</u>,
exportation, importation, <u>handling the distribution</u>, either in wholesale
or retail, the provisions of Republic Act Numbered Eleven hundred and eighty to
the contrary notwithstanding, <u>or the acquisition for the purpose of trade of</u>
rice (husked or <span class="SpellE">unhusked</span>) or corn and <u>the by-products
thereof</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That public
utilities duly licensed and registered in accordance with law may transport
corn or rice." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now, "<span class="SpellE">tahup</span>", "<span class="SpellE">sungo</span>" and "rice husk", which plain­tiff
acquires from rice and corn millers and from which it manufactures the
vegetable oil and produces the "corn meal" or "corn germ
meal" that it subsequently distributes and <span style="">sells </span>are clearly by-products of rice/and or corn.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the term "by-product" is not particularly and
specifically stated in the title of Republic Act 3018, its inclusion in the
body of the law is not invalid, as the lower court held, since <span style="">it is g<u>ermane</u> to </span>the subject
matter expressed in the title of the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the statutory inclusion of said term in the definition
of the phrase "rice and/or corn industry" an invalid legislative
usurpation of the court's function to interpret the <span style="">laws, </span>as the lower court also ruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This definition is part of the law itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the lower court determined the purpose and intention
behind the law, thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In </span>the opinion
of the Court, it was never the intention of the Legislature in enact­ing
Republic Act No. <span style="">3018 </span>to include
<span style="">in its </span>purpose or scope the
processing of the by-pro­ducts of rice and corn because Filipinos do not depend
for their survival by eating the by-products of rice and corn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming, without admitting, that the law in question really
intended to include in its object the <span style="">nationalization
</span>not only of the rice and corn industry but <span style="">also </span>the trade of the by-products just mentioned above, the
business in which the plaintiff has been en­gaged and since December 31, 1962,
as is at present, engaged, the Court is of the opinion that in the trade,
processing, manufacture of corn and rice oil from the raw materials of corn
germ proper or embryo <span style="">(<span class="SpellE"><u>sungo</u></span>) </span>and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">tahup</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>and from rice husk converting the
remaining parts into 'corn meal' or 'corn germ meal' which is traded and sold
and that it acquired its raw materials from those engaged in mill­ing rice
and/or corn, the said Republic Act No. 3018 does not cover the plaintiff's busi­ness
activities just mentioned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is <span style="">a </span>fair and reasonable interpre­tation and application of said
Republic Act No. 3018, because to include in its control, limitation and prohibition
the business of the plaintiff mentioned above, would be not only to render the <span style="">said </span>law unconstitutional for not
including in its title 'and the by-products thereof', but also to unreasonably
stretch out and expand the scope and intention of the law to include in its
context the processing and extracting of oil from rice and corn and the
manufacture of corn meal or corn germ meal and the selling and trading of the
same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As a logical result of this interpretation of the law spelled
out by this Court, it must necessarily follow that the Resolution No. 10, Annex
1 and the general circular dated July 10, 1961, quoted under paragraph <span style="">3 </span><span style="">of the parties' Stipulation of Facts are hereby declared null and void
in so far as they attempted to include in the scope of said law the defendant's
business activities described above in which it engaged since December </span>31,
1962, <span style="">and in which it has been engaged
partly engaged since its formation </span>in 1959."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">What the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>did was to resort to statutory construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this was improper <span style="">as </span>well as incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
law is clear in enunciating the policy that only Fi­lipinos and associations,
partnerships or corporations 100% Filipino can engage even in the trade and
acquisition of the by-products of rice and/or corn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the court's only duty <span style="">was </span>to apply
the law <span style="">as </span>it was.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The purpose of the Act, as expressed in the introductory note of the bill, can
control the language of the law only in case of ambiguity.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There is none here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the court
<span class="SpellE">below’s</span> interpretation would render the statute
nugatory and defeat <span style="">its </span>aims, rather than apply and effectuate its provisions,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
since it struck off the phrase "by-products thereof" from the text of
the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is covered by
the statute, there is no necessity for an extensive discussion regarding the
validity of Resolution No. 10 of November 21, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The power and authority of
appellant RICOB to issue such rules and regulations implementing the law,
proceeds from the law itself.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Said resolution, by enumerating some specific examples of by-products of rice
and/or corn, merely carried out the provisions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the sole reason why the lower court
invalidated <span class="GramE">it,</span> was its mistaken stand that the term
"by-product" <u><span style="">ought not</span></u>
to have been made a part of the statute.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing considerations render moot and academic the
question regarding the validity of General Circular No. 1 of <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment appealed from is reversed and the
