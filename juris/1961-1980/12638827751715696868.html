				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a special proceeding for change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A summary of petitioner's evidence is as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Gil <u>Go</u> was born in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1942" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1942</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His name in the civil register is Gil <u>Co</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was registered as the legitimate son of Co
<span class="SpellE">Beng</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Sun Ti (mother).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During liberation (Commonwealth, according to petitioner's counsel), Co <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>, following a Chinese
custom, allegedly adopted the surname <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Yao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
of his godfather and changed his name to <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> Ka
Sin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No documentary evidence was
presented on this point.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Gil Go was baptized, he was allegedly given the name Gil <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> Eng <span class="SpellE">Hua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His baptismal certificate was not presented
in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gil Go testified that since
childhood, he has been known as Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> among his
relatives, friends and business associates, but in his business and government
transactions, he used the name Gil Co.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No third person corroborated his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not present any documentary evidence
to prove that he is known in the community as Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his alien registration certificate (ACR), which was marked as
Exhibit G but is not found in the record (he withdrew it and did not present
later the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">photostatic</span></span> copy
which his counsel promised to offer as a substitute), he is registered as Gil <u>Go</u>
due to an alleged error of an immigration clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the confusion generated by those
names, he wants legal authorization for the use of the name Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1965</st1:date>
Gil Go filed the instant petition in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that
his name be changed to Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing, the city fiscal opposed
the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court granted it
(Special Proceeding No. 1042).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city
fiscal appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether the lower court erred in allowing the change
of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gil Go did not submit any <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not indicated in
the title or caption of Gil <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> petition that he
desired to change his name to Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The published order setting his petition for
hearing reproduced that defective title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor was it indicated in his petition that his registered name is Gil Co,
a name which he allegedly used in his official transactions (19 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
petition, he used the name Gil <u>Go</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceeding for a change of name is a proceeding <u>in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction
to hear and determine the petition for change of name is acquired after due
publication of the order, setting it for hearing, which order should contain
certain data, among which is the name sought to be adopted, a matter which
should be indicated in the title of the petition (<span class="SpellE">Pabellar</span>
vs. Republic, L-27298, March 4, 1976, 70 SCRA 16).</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for that rule is that the ordinary reader only glances
fleetingly at the caption of the published order or the title of the petition
in a special proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only if the
caption or the title strikes him does he proceed to read the contents of the
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the probability is great that
he does not at all notice the other names or aliases of the applicant if these
are mentioned only in the body of the order or petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">noninclusion</span> of
all the names or aliases of the applicant in the caption of the order or in the
title of the petition defeats the very purpose of the required publication
(Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, L-31563, November 29, 1971, 42
SCRA 419).</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the title of the petition in this case and the order
setting it for hearing were deficient, the lower court did not acquire
jurisdiction over the proceeding (<span class="SpellE">Llerena</span> <span class="SpellE">Telmo</span> vs. Republic, L-28549, September 23, 1976, 73 O.G.
39, 43).</p>

<p class="BODY">On this score alone, the trial court's order granting the
petition should be reversed.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another ground for the
reversal of the trial court's order is that the reasons adduced by Gil Go and
his evidence are insufficient to justify his change of name.</p>

<p class="BODY">Change of name is a matter of public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a privilege and not a matter of
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court should weigh carefully
the consequences of the change of name and deny the same unless weighty reasons
are shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State has an interest in
the names borne by individuals and entities for purposes of
identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peng</span> <span class="SpellE">Oan</span> vs. Republic, 102
Phil. 468).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Change of name may entail
serious consequences and cause some complications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be authorized only for compelling
reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gil Go (Gil Co)'s assertion that he has used the name Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> was not solidly substantiated by any documentary
evidence or by the testimony of other persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His uncorroborated evidence consisted only of his testimony and his
birth certificate where his surname is <u>Co</u>, not <u>Go</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the witness stand, he contradicted the allegation in paragraph
3 of his petition (which he had verified) that he was "christened Gil
Go".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he was
christened Gil <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> Eng <span class="SpellE">Hua</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">He failed to prove the allegation in his petition that the change
of his name to Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> is justified by
"convenience and business reasons".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already observed, he did not offer indubitable proof that he used the
name Henry <span class="SpellE">Yao</span>, or that his father was known as <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> Ka Sin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He used
the name Gil <u>Co</u> in his school records (13 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's order allowing the change of
name is reversed with costs against the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Fernando, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span>
Martin, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Antonio <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">did not take part.</span></span><br>
