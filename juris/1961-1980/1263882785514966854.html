Nonetheless, for cause duly shown, there may be a forced termination of his

prior to his removal, procedural due process be observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grievance alleged by petitioner in this

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that petitioner Felix <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>
was a full-time professor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
University Foundation, serving as head of its Humanities and Psychology
Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previously, he was on the
faculty of other educational institutions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was, on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1974</st1:date>,
a complaint for immorality lodged against him by the Chaplain of the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> University Foundation for alleged immorality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its then President, Dr. Juan <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Jr., created a committee to investigate such
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first hearing, which took
place on <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1974</st1:date>,
was attended by petitioner as well as complainant with his two witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them, Leonardo de Lara, submitted an affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner sought the postponement of the
investigation to <st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that occasion, he was furnished a copy of
the affidavit of the other witness, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accusation centered on conversations on sex and immoral advances committed
against the person of Leonardo de Lara.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was cross-examination by petitioner of the witnesses against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the assistance of counsel, he
filed on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1974</st1:date> a
motion to dismiss or to hold the hearing in abeyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise filed an affidavit to sustain his
defense on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report and recommendation of the
investigating committee came on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="7">July 8,
 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was adverse to
petitioner, who was found morally responsible for the act complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recommendation was for his demotion in
rank by one degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then President
Juan <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, Jr., on August 5, 1974, adopted such
recommendation and thereafter referred the same to the Board of Trustees of
private respondent for appropriate action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="11">November 8,
 1974</st1:date>, with new charges being filed by Professor Luis R. <span class="SpellE">Almazan</span>, one Jaime <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, and
Jesus Martinez against petitioner for conduct unbecoming of a faculty member,
another committee was appointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
came his preventive suspension, ordered to last until the administrative
investigation was concluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a
motion by petitioner for the postponement of the hearing set for November 18
and 19, 1974, but the same was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hearing proceeded in his absence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was testimony by Professor Luis <span class="SpellE">Almazan</span>
and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1974</st1:date>,
the Committee submitted its report finding the charges against petitioner to
have been sufficiently established and recommending to the President and the
Board of Trustees of the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> University
Foundation his separation from the University, in accordance with Sections 116
and 351 of the Manual of Policies of the University.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Committee found as established:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That immoral advances on several occasions have been made by respondent
[herein petitioner] on Prof. Luis <span class="SpellE">Almazan</span>; 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That immoral advances have also been made by
respondent on Jaime <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, a student-employee of
the University on several occasions; 3. That said immoral advances were
frustrated because both Professor <span class="SpellE">Almazan</span> and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> had refused to accept them; 4. That both
witnesses and victims of said immoral advances have declared that the behavior
of respondent was detrimental [and] prejudicial to the moral and educational
standards of the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> University Foundation;
5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That because of said behavior,
respondent should not continue as Professor in the University; and 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the acts of respondent complained of are
offensive to good morals [and] inimical to the welfare of students and greatly
prejudicial to [the] interest and educational objectives of the University,
hence the same are highly reprehensible."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
His dismissal was then ordered on <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1974</st1:date>, effective <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1974</st1:date>, the date of his preventive suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The University, on <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1974</st1:date>, filed with the National Labor
Relations Commission a report of his suspension and application for clearance
to terminate his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
on <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioner in turn lodged a complaint with the National Labor Relations
Commission against private respondents for reinstatement and payment of back
wages and salaries, with all the privileges, benefits and increments attendant
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a motion to dismiss
on the part of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the
labor arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission found in favor of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was ordered reinstated to
his former position with back wages and without loss of seniority and other
privileges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's complaint for
unfair labor practice was, however, dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents appealed to respondent Secretary of Labor who, on <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1976</st1:date>, set aside the
Commission's order for his reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He found petitioner's dismissal justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was he persuaded by the plea that there
was denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
satisfied with the procedure followed by private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he could not have ignored the fact
that the controversy between the parties was passed upon and the parties heard
on their respective contentions in the proceedings before the labor
agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Respondent</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> was however, required to
pay complainant the amount of P14,480.00 representing the latter's accrued back
wages which the former voluntarily offered to extend him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dissatisfied with the Secretary's decision,
petitioner filed this instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The present Constitution, as noted, expanded
the scope of the protection to labor mandate by specifying that the State shall
assure the right of workers to security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, as stressed in Philippine Air
Lines, Inc. v. Philippine Air Lines Employees Association<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

Subsequently, in <span class="SpellE">Almira</span> v. B. F. Goodrich <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
it was the ruling of this Tribunal that even where disciplinary action against
an employee is warranted, "where a penalty less punitive [than dismissal]
would suffice, whatever missteps may be committed ought not to be visited with
a consequence so severe."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
An instructor or member of a teaching staff of a university was held, in the
leading case of <span class="SpellE">Feati</span> University V. Bautista,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
to be an employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, he is
entitled to that security of tenure guaranteed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explicit pronouncement in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Feati</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
v. Bautista was foreshadowed by <st1:place><st1:placename>Far</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Eastern</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> v. Court of Industrial

a 1962 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a faculty member
such as petitioner maybe dismissed, it must be for cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, there must be clearance from
the Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is
provided in the Labor Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The stand taken by petitioner as to his being
entitled to security of tenure is reinforced by the provision on academic
freedom which, as noted, is found in the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While reference therein is to institutions of
higher learning, it was pointed out in Garcia v. The Faculty Admission
Committee<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
that academic freedom "is more often identified with the right of a
faculty member to pursue his studies in his particular specialty and thereafter
to make known or publish the result of his endeavors without fear that
retribution would be visited on him in the event that his conclusions are found
distasteful or objectionable to the powers that be, whether in the political,
economic, or academic establishments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the sociologist, Robert <span class="SpellE">MacIver</span>, it is 'a
right claimed by the accredited educator, as teacher and as investigator, to
interpret his findings and to communicate his conclusions without being
subjected to any interference, molestation, or penalization because these
conclusions are unacceptable to some constituted authority within or beyond the
institution.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Tenure, according to him, is of the essence of such freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For him, without tenure that assures a
faculty member "against dismissal or professional penalization on grounds
other than professional incompetence or conduct that in the judgment of his
colleagues renders him unfit" for membership in the faculty, the academic
right becomes non-existent.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Security of tenure, for another scholar, Lovejoy, is "the chief practical
requisite for academic freedom" of a university professor.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
As with <span class="SpellE">Maclver</span>, he did not rule out removal but only
"for some grave cause," identified by him as "proved
incompetence or moral delinquency."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charge leveled against petitioner, that
of making homosexual advances to certain individuals, if proved, did amount to
a sufficient cause for removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
crucial question therefore is whether it was shown that he was guilty of such
immoral conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is thus entitled to
the protection of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To paraphrase Webster, there must be a hearing before condemnation, with
the investigation to proceed in an orderly manner, and judgment to be rendered
only after such inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back as
1915, the American Association of University Professors adopted the principle
that "every university or college teacher should be entitled before
dismissal or demotion, to have the charges against him stated in writing, in
specific terms and to have a fair trial on these charges before a special or permanent
judicial committee of the faculty or by the faculty at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At such trial the teacher accused should have
full opportunity to present evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus the phrase, academic due process, has gained currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joughin</span> referred to
it as a system of procedure designed to yield the best possible judgment when
an adverse decision against a professor may be the consequence with stress on
the clear, orderly, and fair way of reaching a conclusion.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The procedure followed in the first
investigation of petitioner, conducted in June of 1974, did satisfy the
procedural due process requisite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same cannot be said of the November, 1974 inquiry when the petitioner had to
face anew a similar charge of making homosexual advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As admitted in the exhaustive comment of the
Solicitor General:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On November 16,
1974, <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, through counsel, moved for the
postponement of the hearing set for November 18 and 19, 1974 but the same was
rejected by the committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing
proceeded as scheduled in the absence of Professor <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>
and his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said hearing, Prof.
Luis <span class="SpellE">Almazan</span> and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
testified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1974</st1:date>, the Committee submitted its
report finding the charges against <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> to have
been sufficiently established and recommending to the President and the Board
of Trustees of the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> University Foundation his
separation from the University, in accordance with Sections 116 and 351 of the
Manual of Policies of the University."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It does appear therefore that the members of such investigating committee
failed to show full awareness of the demands of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion by petitioner for postponement of
the hearing, apparently the first one made; was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, in his absence the matter was
heard with the committee losing no time in submitting its report, finding the
charges against petitioner to have been sufficiently established and
recommending his removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that were
all, respondent Secretary of Labor cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Certiorari</i> would lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such deficiency was remedied, as pointed
out in the same comment of the Solicitor General, by the fact "that
petitioner was able to present his case before the Labor Commission.”<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Then he continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Thus, the record
discloses that at a mediation conference held on <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1974</st1:date>, the parties appeared and, after all
efforts at conciliation had failed, they agreed to submit their dispute for
compulsory arbitration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several hearings
were conducted by Labor Arbiter Atty. Daniel Lucas, Jr., wherein petitioner
submitted his evidence supported by his affidavit impugning the regularity of
the proceedings before the investigating committees and assailing the legality
of his removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire record of the
administrative proceedings, including the transcript of the stenographic notes
taken therein, was elevated to the Labor Commission for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner herein, thru counsel, moved for
reinstatement during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another motion, he prayed for the
consolidation and joint hearing of his complaint for unfair labor practice
against herein private respondents (NLRC Case No. R-IV-1060-74) with that of
the application for clearance filed by the University to terminate <span class="SpellE">Montemayor's</span> employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the University moved to dismiss the complaint for
unfair labor practice against its officials on the ground that they were not
complainant's employers and that their participation in the administrative case
against the latter was official in nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:place><st1:placename>Respondent</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
also presented the affidavit of Thomas P. G. Neill, Dean of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Institute</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Agricultural Business Administration</st1:placename></st1:place>
and Chairman of the Committee created to investigate the charges of immorality
against petitioner attesting to the regularity of the proceedings and the
validity of the dismissal."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The legal aspect as to the procedural due process having been satisfied was
then summarized by the Solicitor General thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"All the foregoing clearly shows that petitioner was afforded his
day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, and more
significant, is the fact that petitioner claims denial of due process in the
proceeding had before the investigating committees and not in the proceedings
before the NLRC wherein, as shown heretofore, he was given the fullest
opportunity to present his case."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The comment of the Solicitor General was submitted
on <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The memorandum for petitioner was submitted
on April 25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What immediately calls
attention is that no attempt was made to refute specifically such recital of
the Solicitor General, of decisive significance as far as the due process issue
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the emphasis was
on the alleged commission of an unfair labor practice by private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the Arbiter as
well as the National Labor Relations Commission absolved private respondent
from the charge of unfair labor practice, it would appear that the emphasis of
counsel for petitioner was misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, there is nothing in the record that would militate against
the contention of the Solicitor General that there was an observance of
procedural due process.</p>
