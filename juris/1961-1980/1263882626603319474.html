Court of Appeals committed a grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the
petition for review of the decision of the trial Court in the aforesaid cases
for having been filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 18, 1971, a collision between a motor cab and a passenger
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> took place in the City of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
rise to two civil cases - Civil Cases Nos. B-1592 <span style="">"</span><span style="">entitled <span class="SpellE">Aniano</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span>

tried in the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City, Branch II,
for damages arising from quasi <span class="SpellE">delict</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Both cases were appealed to the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 29, 1975, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span>
Norte, Branch II affirmed the decision of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners received the decision
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del
Norte, Branch II on September 25, 1975 but due to pressure of work of the
petitioners' counsel, the petition for review was actually finished only on
October 25, 1975 at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of that day which was a
Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Post Office of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City opened its offices only up to 12:00 o'clock on
that day, petitioners' counsel was not able to mail the petition for review on
October 25, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able to
register the same on the next working day on October 27, 1975, October 26,
being a Sunday. According to the resolution of the respondent Court of Appeals,
<u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated August 12, 1971, regarding cases elevated to the
Court of Appeals under Republic Act 6031, the petition for review must be filed
within 30 days from notice of the judgment or decision in civil cases (Section
3, Rule 41, <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that the petitioners
failed to file their petition for review on October 25, 1975 because when they
arrived at the Post Office of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City on
Saturday afternoon, the office was already closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were late by a few hours because the
office closed at exactly 12:00 o'clock on that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that was the reason why the petition had
to be filed on October 27, 1975, October 26, 1975 being a Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, petitioners were late only a few
hours in beating the deadline for filing their petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be argued, however, that it was the
fault of the petitioners not to have come on time to the Post Office to mail
the petition, but the fault was not serious enough as to amount to inexcusable
neg­ligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident from the
records that the delay of the filing of the petition for review by petitioners
was far from being intentional and dilatory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At least it could be deduced from the conduct of the petitioners that they
were in earnest in meeting the deadline for the filing of the petition by going
to the Post Office of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City on the very same
day only that they were late by a few hours.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been held in a number of cases that pleadings, <span style="">as </span>well as
remedial laws, should be construed liberally, in, order that litigants may have
ample opportunity to prove their respective claims, and that a possible denial
of substantial justice, due to legal technica<span style="">lities, may be avoided.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Certainly, to <span style="">dismiss the </span>petition for review due to its late filing for a few
hours or even a day or two without regard to the circumstances for the delay is
giving too much importance to legal technicalities which may unfortunately
amount to a denial of substantial justice to petitioners. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Normally, a petition for review of the
decision of the lower court could be thrown out for being filed out of time
except when there is a special circumstance that may warrant a liberal attitude
of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this Court has already
considered Section 1, Rule 50 of the Revised Rules of Court</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as discretionary, not mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Maqui</span> v.
Court of Appeals,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court had reiterated the caveat we have
enunciated in Philippine National Bank vs. Philippine Milling Co., Inc.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to the effect that "Rule 50, Section 1
of the Revised Rules </span><span style="">of Court </span><span style="">which provides specific grounds for dismissal
of appeal manifestly 'confers a power and does not impose a duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more it is directory, not man­datory.'"
This Court reasoned out:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A right adherence to the technical rules of procedure
disregards the fundamen­tal aim of procedure to serve as an aid to justice, not
as a means for its frustration (Economic Ins. Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Realty Co., 34 SCRA 744, 749) and the objective of the Rules of Court to afford
litigants just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, excusable im­perfections of form and
technicalities of procedure or lapses in the literal or rigid observance of a
procedural rule or non-jurisdictional deadline provided therein should be
overlooked and brushed aside as trivial and indecisive in the interest of fair
play and justice when public policy is not involved, no prejudice has been
caused the adverse party and the court has not been deprived of its authority
or jurisdiction."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since it is within the discretion of the
respondent Court to dismiss or not to dismiss the petition for review filed by
petitioners and this discretion is supposed to be a sound one, to be exercised
in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play, having in mind the
circumstances obtaining in each case, the respondent Court should have
considered the circumstance for the delay in the filing of the petition in
question in petitioners' favor as one deserving the respondent Court's
leniency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Besides there
is no showing that the dismissed appeal was frivolous and for the purpose of
delay.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution sought to be reviewed in this
case is set aside and the respondent Court ordered to reinstate the petition
for review <span style="">and give due course to the <span style="">same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">Without pronounce­ment as to costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
