				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Appeal from the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon City.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">SUMMARY<br></div><br>Appeal from a decision ordering defendants-appellants to pay jointly and severally the amount of P10,000.00 to each of the two plaintiffs as moral damages plus P5,000.00 each as exemplary damages with legal interest from the date of the filing of the complaint until fully paid. Defendants assigned two errors allegedly committed by the trial court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">RULING<br></div><br>Without going into the merits of the causes of action of the plaintiffs, and the defenses advanced by the defendants, the Supreme Court find that the appeal has been erroneously directed to this Court. It will noted that the amount involved in the appealed judgment is only P15,000.00 for each of the plaintiffs, far below the amount upon which the Supreme Court may acquire appellate jurisdiction. For another thing, the character of the allegedly libelous articles, the question as to whether or not the defendants were negligent, and whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to the damages and for what amount are issues of fact falling under the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.</div>
