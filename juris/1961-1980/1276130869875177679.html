				<BR><BR><p>Appeal from an order of dismissal of the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental.</p>
<p>The factual background of this case is set forth in our decision in case G. 
R. No. L-14636, entitled "Gorgonia de la Petia, in behalf of her daughter Remela 
Zaldarriaga vs. Consuelo Vda. de Zaldarriaga at al.", decided on June30, 1960, 
involving an appeal from an order of dismissal of said court in Civil Case No. 
4895 thereof. We quote, from said decision:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On July 2, 1958, plaintiff in behalf of her minor daughter Remela 
Zaldarriaga, filed with the above-mentioned court, a complaint against 
defendants </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consuelo Vda. de Zaldarriaga, as judicial administratrix of the Intestate 
Estate of Pedro Zaldarriaga; </p>
<p>Ernesto Zaldarriaga, Guadalupe Zaldarriaga and Jesus Zaldarriaga, Jr. as 
heirs, and the first as Judicial Administrator of the Intestate Estate of Jesus 
Zaldarriaga, son of Pedro Zaldarriaga; and </p>
<p>Basilia Vda. de Zaldarriaga, as Judicial Administratrix of the Intestate 
Estate of Jose Zaldarriaga, another son of Pedro Zaidarriaga </p></blockquote>
<p>alleging, inter alia, as to the first cause of action, that from 1938 to 
1944, plaintiff Gorgonia de la Peña and the late Julio Zaldarriaga (a third son 
of Pedro Zaldarriaga) lived together as common-law husband and wife of Barrio 
Mabini, Cadiz, Negros Occidental; that out of said relationship, 3 children were 
born, namely, Julio, Jr., who died when he was 14 days old;Toto, who died at the 
age of 2 years; and Remela, who was born on November 16, 1940; that said Julio 
Zaldarriaga died in 1944 when Remela was only 4 years old; and that from 
November 16,1940 until the latter part of 1944, Remela was in continuous 
possession of the status of an acknowledged natural child of Julio Zaldarriaga 
by virtue of the latter's overt acts and those of his family represented by the 
defendants. In respect to the second cause of action, she alleged, among other 
things, that the late Pedro Zaldarriaga had 4 sons, namely, Jesus, Jose, Manuel, 
and Julio Zaldarriaga that PedroZaldarriaga and his said sons were the 
registered co-owners of Lots Nos. 936, 937, 940, and 94l of the Cadastral Survey 
of Cadiz, Negros Occidental, in the following proportions: Pedro, 4/8 share; 
Jesus, l/8 share; Jose, 1/8 share; Manuel, l/8 share; and Julio, l/8 share; that 
said Julio Zaldarriaga died intestate; that plaintiff Remela Zaldarriaga 
inherited the l/8 share of her natural father Julio Zaldarriaga, including the 
l/8 sugar quota pertaining to said lots; and that she made repeated demands on 
defendants to deliver the l/8 part of said lots to her, but the latter refused 
to do so. Plaintiff prayed in the first cause of action, that Remela Zaldarriaga 
be declared as the acknowledged natural daughter of the late Julio Zaidarriaga. 
In the second cause of action, she prayed, inter alia, for an order partitioning 
said lots Nos. 936, 937, 940,and 941, in order that the l/8 portion of the same 
be registered in the name of Remela Zaldarriaga .</p>
<p>"On July 25, 1958, defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that 
the court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, inasmuch as 
there was then pending before this Court a case (G.R. No. L-13424) involving the 
partition of the same lots (Lots Nos. 936, 937, 940, and 941) subject matter of 
the complaint. On July 29, 1958, plaintiff filed an answer to said motion to 
dismiss.</p>
<p>"On August 16, 1958, defendants filed a supplementary motion to dismiss, on 
the ground that there was then pending another action (Special Proceeding ho. 
4476) in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, between the same 
parties, for the same cause. On August 22, 1958, plaintiff filed an answer to 
said supplementary motion to dismiss, to which, defendants filed a reply on 
August 25, 1938.On August 27, 1958, plaintiff filed an answer to said reply.</p>
<p>"On August 28, 1958, defendant Basilia Vda. de Zaldarriaga, filed her answer 
toplaintiff's complaint. On the same date, the court dismissed plaintiff's 
complaint, * *." </p></blockquote>
<p>A reconsideration of this order of dismissal having denied, Gorgonia de la 
Peña appealed to the SupremeCourt - and docketed therein as G. R. No. L-14636 – 
which reversed said order the same being erroneously predicated upon the theory 
that the issues in said case No. 4895 -or G. R. No. L-14636 of the Supreme Court 
- were already in litigation in Civil Case No. 2705 of the aforementioned 
inferior court, which is not true, because said case No. 2705 referred to the 
estate of Jose Zaldarriaga, whereas case No. 4895 involved the estate of 
<em>Julio</em> Zaldarriaga. </p>
<p>However, Gorgonia de la Peña had filed in said case G.R. No. L-14636 (or No. 
4895 of the court of first instance) a motion to withdraw the appeal therein, 
for the reason that she had meanwhile instituted in the lower court Special 
Proceeding No. 5267, for the settlement of the estate of the deceased Julio 
Zaldarriaga, in which the issues raised in case No. 4895 could be settled, and 
said motion to withdraw the appeal was objected to upon the ground that the 
lower court was disposed to dismiss said case No. 5267. Consequently, we did not 
deem it advisable to dismiss the appeal in G.R. No. L-14636 (or case No. 4895) 
and, instead our decision, promulgated on June 30, i960, remanded the case (No. 
4895) "to the court of origin for further proceedings, without prejudice to 
appellant's choosing either to proceed with this case or the intestate 
proceeding No. 5267 instituted by her. </p>
<p>Soon thereafter, or on July 14, 1960, Gorgonia de la Peña filed in said case 
No. 5267 a "manifestation" inviting attention of the Court of First Instance of 
Negros Occidental to said decision of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-14636 
(Case No. 4895), and stating that she preferred to continue said civil case 
rather than case No. 5267, and praying, accordingly, that the latter be 
dismissed. </p>
<p>On September 2, 1960, Enrique F. Marino, who had been appointed, in said 
Special Proceeding No. 5267, judicial administrator of the estate of Julio 
Zaldarriaga, objected to said manifestation and/or petition for dismissal; but, 
this notwithstanding, the lower court granted the petition and issued an order, 
dated October 4, 1960, dismissing said case No. 5267. Marino sought a 
reconsideration of this order, to no avail. </p>
<p>Hence, its propriety is now assailed by him, upon the ground that, upon 
institution of said case No. 5267,the probate court has acquired exclusive 
jurisdiction over the settlement of the estate of Julio Zaldarriaga to the 
exclusion of all other courts, and, consequently, case No. 4895 was 
automatically abandoned; that it is improper for a declaration of heirs to be 
made in an ordinary civil action (Case No. 4895), in view of the pendency of 
case No. 5267 for the settlement of the estate of said deceased; that the 
question as to who are his heirs and what are their respective shares, should be 
determined in said case No. 5267; that Marino should recover the property of the 
deceased and the rentals and fruits thereof, as well as the sugar quota 
pertaining thereto, from Ernesto, Guadalupe and Jesus, Jr., all surnamed 
Zaldarriaga, who have illegally possessed said property and collected the 
aforementioned rentals, fruits and sugar quota; that the estate and inheritance 
taxes due to the Government should be determined and paid in said case No. 5267; 
that the order of distribution of the residue of the estate of Julio Zaldarriaga 
to the persons entitled thereto should, also, be issued in that case; and that 
the estate of the deceased was not duly represented in said case No. 4895. </p>
<p>We find no merit in this appeal, far Ernesto, Guadalupe and Jesus, Jr., all 
surnamed Zaldarriaga, and all other persons who claim an interest in the estate 
of Julio Zaldarriaga, are parties in case No. 4895, and none of them has 
objected to the dismissal of case No.5267. In fact, appellant has not named 
anybody having an interest in both cases who is not a party in case No. 4895. 
Upon the other hand, it is well settled that the matter of acknowledgement of an 
alleged natural child and his claim as such to a share in the estate of the 
alleged natural father may be determined either in an ordinary civil action or 
in special proceedings for the settlement of the estate of the deceased father 
(Escoval vs. Escoval, 48 Off. Ga. 616; Tiamson vs. Tiamson, 52 Phil.62; Briz vs. 
Briz, 43 Phil. 763, 768; Suarez vs. Suarez, 43 Phil. 903, 905; Conde vs. Abaya, 
13 Phil. 249; Capistrano vs. Fabella, 8 Phil. 249; Siguion vs. Siguion, 8 
Phil,5). As a consequence, the remedies sought by Gorgonia dela Peña may be 
entertained either in case No. 4895 or incase No. 5267. So too, the question 
whether Ernesto, Guadalupe and Jesus, Jr., all surnamed Zaldarriaga, should 
surrender the possession of the property of the deceased Julio Zaldarriaga and 
refund the rentals, fruits and sugar quota thereof allegedly collected by them, 
may, likewise, be determined in case No. 4895. </p>
<p>Should persons, other than those who are parties incase No. 4895, feel that 
their interest in the estate of the deceased may be affected by the proceedings 
therein, they may intervene in such case; and this includes the Government, as 
regards estate and inheritance taxes, if any were due. Hence, we do not find 
that, in issuing the order appealed from, the lower court has adversely affected 
the right of any person who possesses a substantial interest in the 
aforementioned estate. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, said order is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this instance 
against herein appellant Enrique F. Marino.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.</p>
