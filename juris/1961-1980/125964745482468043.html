				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Unions filed the instant case to prohibit and enjoin the Court of 
Industrial Relations from hearing and adjudicating the labor controversy between 
the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Government Service 
Insurance System Employees' Association (GSISEA) and Supervisors' Union 
(GSISSU), now constituting Case No. 38-IPA of the Industrial Court. After 
hearing and oral argument on October 6, 1961, we dismissed the petition by 
resolution of the same date, without prejudice to a more extended decision.
<p>The issue is whether, the labor controversy between the GSIS Employees' 
Association and the Supervisors' Union (which are affiliates of the other 
petitioner groups) and the GSIS Management, concerning implementation of 
certain provisions on salary standardization contained in their collective 
bargaining agreement, has been properly certified by the President of the 
Philippines to the Court of Industrial Relations. It appears that on August 15, 
1961, the then Executive Secretary Natalio P. Castillo, in a letter (Annex E) 
dated August 15, 1961 and signed by him "by authority of the President", 
officially referred the controversy to the Industrial Court, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Considering the importance of continued operations of the System to our 
government employees and to the Government and the consequences that would ensue 
should a strike develop, it is believed that this is a dispute in an industry 
indispensable to the national interest.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Pursuant to Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875, otherwise known as the Magna 
Charta of Labor, the President hereby certifies the dispute between the 
management of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Government 
Service Insurance System Employees' Association (GSISEA) and the Government 
Service Insurance System Supervisors' Union (GSISSU) to the Court of Industrial 
Relations and requests the Court to take immediate appropriate steps in the 
exercise of its powers under the law." <br></p></blockquote><p>The Unions question this letter and claim 
that the same constitutes no valid certification, on the grounds (a) that the 
President on the date of the letter was in the Visayas and arrived only on the 
night of August 17, and there is no proof that the Executive Secretary was 
authorized to act on behalf of the President; and (b) that the powers of the 
President under section 10 of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) can not be 
delegated to a Cabinet member.</p>
<p>We see no merit in this contention. The Executive Secretary's letter (Annex E 
of the Petition) Is not a certification of the industrial dispute by the 
Executive Secretary, but attests to the fact that the President has ordered said 
dispute certified to the Industrial Court, as required by law. The fact that on 
several previous occasions, Presidents of the Philippines have made similar 
certifications through letters addressed to the Court of Industrial Relations 
and personally signed by them, is of no significance, since the statute does not 
prescribe in what form the Chief Executive should certify an industrial 
controversy to the Court of Industrial Relations. </p>
<p>That the president was not in Manila on the date of the letter certainly does 
not preclude his having ordered the reference in question. The facilities of 
communication now available contradict any impossibility of such order being 
made. The presumption of performance of official duty on the part of the 
Executive Secretary is not rebutted by mere conjectures based on the absence of 
the President from a given locality, nor by the lack of any mention of the 
certification by the chronicle of the President's activities in the Official 
Gazette. For the Executive Secretary to officially state in writing that the 
President has made or authorized the certification, when in fact he has not done 
so, would constitute the crime of falsification of an official document, and the 
commission of such offense can not be lightly inferred.</p>
<p>That the certification came two days before the strike was declared is 
immaterial, since section 10 of the Act does not require the existence of a 
strike, but only of an <em>industrial dispute</em>; and it is not denied that 
the employer and the Unions had such a dispute, and that officials of the 
Department of Labor previously tried to conciliate the disputants but without 
success.</p>
<p>The respondents have shown, furthermore, that the Chief Executive has 
approved, over his signature, the request made by the Manager of the Government 
Service Insurance System in his letter of August 11, to have its dispute with 
the Unions certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (Respondents' Exhibit 
1). No delegation of power was, therefore, involved, contrary to the allegations 
of the petitioners.</p>
<p>Finding no merit in the petition, we hereby dismiss the same, and the writs 
sought are denied. Costs against petitioners .</p><em>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</em> and <em>De Leon, JJ.,</em> concur.
