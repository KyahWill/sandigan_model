				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is an original
petition for mandamus and habeas corpus filed by Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Apao</span>
and others against the Honorable Tito V. <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span> a</span><span style="">s </span><span style="">Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Cerilles</span> a</span>s Assistant Provincial Fiscal, and the
Honorable Javier <span class="SpellE">Arriosa</span> as Provincial Governor and
Jailer, of the same province.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On or about </span><st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="1"><span style="">January
 28, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> petitioners
and other persons were charged with double murder in a complaint filed in the
Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 27 of the same year the court
dismissed the complaint upon motion of the Special </span>Prosecutor detailed
to handle the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1962</st1:date>, however, <span style="">a </span>second complaint was filed in the
same Justice of the Peace Court against the same parties charging them with the
commission of the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
their arrest and an express waiver of their right to a preliminary investigation,
the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance of the province where on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1962</st1:date> petitioners filed an
urgent motion for bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After some delay
in the hearing upon this motion, on July 24 of the same year the respondent
judge denied it upon the ground that it was filed prematurely in view of the
fact that, up to that time, the Provincial Fiscal had not yet filed the
corresponding information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners'
motion for reconsideration of this ruling was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that thereafter petitioners urged the office of the
Provincial Fiscal to take immediate action so as to enable the Court to
consider their motion for bail, but this notwithstanding no information was
immediately filed because the Fiscal in <span style="">charge
</span>of the case had not been able to confer with the prosecution witnesses
who resided in far away muni­cipalities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view thereof, petitioners filed the present action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition having been given due course on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1962</st1:date>, the respondents were duly
summoned and required to file their answer within two days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 29 of the same year the respondent
Assistant Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> filed his answer, while the respondent Pro­vincial
Governor and the respondent judge filed their own separate answer days later.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 11, 1962 the respondent Assistant Provincial Fiscal
filed <span style="">a </span>supplemental answer
alleging therein that on the 4th of said month an information had been filed in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> charging herein petitioners with double murder
(Criminal Case No. 2073), and praying that the present action be dismissed
because it had become moot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view
thereof <span class="GramE">We</span> issued <span style="">a </span>resolution on the same date ordering the respondent judge or,
in his absence, the justice of the peace of the provincial capital of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, to
expeditiously hear and resolve the motion for bail filed by petitioners
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the record shows that,
pursuant to our resolution, the respondent judge set the hearing on the motion
for bail on September 13, 1962 and that on the 28th of the same month and year,
<span style="">His Honor had issued </span>an order in
Criminal Case No. 2073 mentioned above denying the aforesaid motion for bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts and circumstances show that the present case
has become moot and academic, for which reason it is hereby dismissed, without
costs.</p>
