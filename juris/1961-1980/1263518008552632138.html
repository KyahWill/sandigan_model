				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Special civil action for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus to
annul and set aside the orders issued by the Court of First Instance of Antique,
in its Civil Case No. 334, under date of 6 January and 4 March 1967, denying
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Guanzon's</span> motions to require the Sheriff
to convey and restore to her the possession and ownership of Lot 5250 of the
cadastral survey of San Jose, Antique.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of the case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents <span class="SpellE">Dumaraogs</span> filed an
action against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> for the redemption
of a parcel of rice land situated in barrio <span class="SpellE">Inabasan</span>,
San Jose, Antique, which their mother, <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> Flores,
had mortgaged to defendant, and to recover damages, before the Antique Court of
First Instance, <span class="GramE">presided</span> by respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed that the purported <span class="SpellE">p<u>acto</u></span><u> de retro</u> sale be declared a mortgage
and that <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> be ordered to execute an instrument
of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> after payment by <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span>
of the loan of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> denied the material allegations
of the complaint and alleged that the document executed by <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>
was in fact a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> sale and
that her title as vendee had been consolidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered judgment declaring the docu­ment
involved to be one of equitable mortgage, and ordered <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
to execute an instrument of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> upon payment by the latter of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
within 20 days from the finality of the decision, otherwise execution may issue
and the Provincial Sheriff may execute the necessary document of conveyance,
with costs against <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court also declared that whatever
addi­tional amounts were loaned to the vendor-a-retro, Flores, by <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> were offset <span class="GramE">by</span> the value
of the 30 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> a
year she received from 1949 to 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, alleging that although the aforesaid decision had
become final and that the <span class="SpellE">Dumaraogs</span> had not paid to
her P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> within 20 days from the date of the
decision, <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> filed a motion for execution
wherein she prayed that the Provincial Sheriff be ordered to execute the
necessary conveyance of the property in question in her favor and that she be
placed in the possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon <span class="SpellE">Guanzon's</span> motion for
execution, the trial court ordered the <span class="SpellE">Dumaraogs</span> to
deposit the P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> redemption price with the clerk
of court, which <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> shall receive, and that <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> shall within 10 days from receipt of the order
execute the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span>, otherwise the Provincial Sheriff shall execute
the necessary conveyance in favor of <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> could withdraw the said amount.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> filed with the lower court a
bill of costs for its approval which <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> opposed
on the ground that she could be liable for costs only if <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span>
paid her P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> within 20 days from the finality of
the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite this opposition,
the respondent judge by order approved the said bill of costs and issued an
execution of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in pursuance of the decision, <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span>
filed a notice of deposit of the redemption price of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the orders of the respondent judge (1) directing <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> to deposit the P1,500.00 redemption price and for
her to receive the said amount and to execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span>, and (2) approving the <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog's</span> bill of costs, <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that the lower court has no
jurisdiction to issue the said orders for lack of jurisdiction, considering
that the decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
hence it becomes the minis­terial duty of the court to issue the writ of
execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="3">4 March
 1967</st1:date>, the respondent judge denied <span class="SpellE">Guanzon's</span>
motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Judge stated that it is not contemplated in the decision that
<span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> is entitled to a deed of conveyance, and that
at most, she could withhold execution of the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
until <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> pays P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>,
otherwise the Provincial Sheriff shall execute the neces­sary conveyance in her
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> filed this petition claiming
that the respondent judge acted in excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse
of discretion, arguing that the respondent judge altered his original decision,
because although she was directed to execute a <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
within 20 days in the original decision declaring the questioned document as an
equitable mortgage, in the order of 6 January 1967 herein complained of she was
given another additional 10 days to do so; and also in its order of 4 March
1967, the respondent judge allowed <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> to
deposit the redemption price of P1,500.00 even after the lapse of 20 days after
the finality of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner states that while the decision of <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="8">31 August 1966</st1:date> has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="10">14 October 1966</st1:date>, it was
only on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="1">6 January 1967</st1:date> that <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> deposited the said amount with the clerk of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the charge of grave abuse of discretion not
justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The final decision of the
respondent court, in its operative clause, provided the following:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court hereby renders judgment:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Declaring the document
executed on 26 April 1949 by <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> Flores in favor of
Maria T. <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>, Exhibit A (same as Exhibit 2) an
equitable mortgage instead of a <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Ordering the defendant
Maria T. <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> to execute a <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
in favor of the plaintiffs herein upon payment by the said plaintiffs of the
amount of P1,500.00 within twenty (20) days from the finality of this decision
otherwise execution may issue and that Provincial Sheriff may execute the
necessary conveyance, with costs against the defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Counterclaim is
dismissed for lack of proof.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While paragraph 2 is not as clear as it could have been,
nevertheless, its purport is plain that should the plaintiffs (now private
respondents <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span>) fail to pay the P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> within the specified 20 days, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> would be entitled to have execution issue to
collect the said amount from the properties of the respondents <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> whereupon the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
would be executed by <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A <span class="SpellE">converso</span>,</u>
should respondents <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> deposit the money, but <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> refused to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>, the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> could then be made by the Provincial Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in accord with the provisions of
section 10, Rule 39, of the Revised Rules of Court:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 10.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Judgment for specific
acts; vesting title</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If a
judgment directs a party to execute a conveyance of land, or to deliver deeds
or other do­cuments, or to perform any other specific act, and the party fails
to comply within the time specified, the court may direct the act to be done at
the costs of the disobedient party by some other person appointed by the court
and the act when so done shall have like effect as if done by the party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If real or personal property is within the
Philippines, the court in lieu of directing a conveyance thereof may enter
judgment divesting the title of any party and vesting it in others and such
judgment shall have the force and effect of a conveyance executed in due form
of law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In no way can the judgment at bar be construed to mean that
should the <span class="SpellE">Dumaraogs</span> fail to pay the money within the
specified period then the property would be conveyed by the Sheriff to <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
interpre­tation in that sense would contradict the declaration made in the same
judgment that the contract between the parties was in fact a mortgage and not a
<span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only right of a mortgagee in case of non
payment of a debt secured by mortgage would be to foreclose the mortgage and
have the encumbered property sold to satisfy the out­standing
indebtedness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgagor's default
does not operate to vest in the mortgagee the ownership of the encumbered
property, for any such effect is against public policy, as enunciated by the
Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The court can not be presumed to have adjudged what would be contrary to law,
unless it <span class="GramE">be</span> plain and inescapable from its final
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such purport appears or is
legitimately inferable from the terms of the judgment <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the orders of the court below refusing
to command the sheriff to convey the property to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>,
as she demanded, and instead ordering her to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the property to respondents <span class="SpellE">Dumaraog</span> and receive the
P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> deposited by the latter, were in conformity
with the original decision that had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writs prayed for are denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioner.</span></p>
