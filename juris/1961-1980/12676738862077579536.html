<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Certiorari to review a resolution 
of the Court of Industrial Relations, in its Case No. 198-MC-Cebu (Allied 
Workers' Association <i>vs</i>. "Hacienda Valencia” Business Enterprises and 
<span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp; Co., Inc.), asserting its jurisdiction 
over the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Allied Workers' Association 
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> 
Chapter, Agricultural Section, a labor organization with Permit No. 3296-IP from 
the Department of Labor, had petitioned the Court of Industrial Relations for a 
certification as sole and exclusive representative of all the employees of the 
"Hacienda </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Valencia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">," owned and operated by 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp; Co., Inc. The latter filed a 
motion to dismiss, claiming that the petitioning workers were all agricultural 
workers of the "Hacienda Valencia," an enterprise dedicated solely to the 
planting and cultivation of sugar cane; and that, as decided in the case of 
Santos <i>vs</i>. C.I.R., L-17196, December 28, 1961, controversies between 
capital and labor in agricultural lands under any system of cultivation are 
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations and not 
within that of the Court of Industrial Relations. The motion to dismiss was 
granted by the hearing judge; but upon appeal to the court <i>en banc</i>, the 
latter, by majority vote, reversed the resolution, holding that it has 
"exclusive jurisdiction over all cases that pertain to the union rights of the 
employees, agriculture workers being included therein by virtue of section 27 of 
Republic Act 2263."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hence this 
petition for certiorari.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The question of jurisdiction over 
conflicts between landowners and laborers engaged in agricultural work is not 
new, and has been repeatedly passed upon by this Supreme Court. <span class="GramE">The case of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co. 
<i>vs</i>. C.I.R. and Free <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Workers, G. R. 
No.</span> L-17281, decided on March 30, 1963, is particularly relevant, being 
almost on all fours with the present case. There a union of laborers working in 
the sugar cane <i>haciendas</i> of the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> 
Milling Co. had charged the company with unfair labor practice in the Court of 
Industrial Relations. The latter's jurisdiction was impugned <span class="GramE">before</span> this Court, and it was held 
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The members of respondent Union 
are merely agricultural laborers in petitioner's haciendas, the principal work 
of which is planting and harvesting sugar cane and other chores incidental to 
ordinary farming operations. They are agricultural workers, and in the 
supposition that the milling: company had committed unfair labor practice upon 
them, the <i>Court of Agrarian Relations</i> has jurisdiction over the 
case."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was also ruled in Hacienda 
Esperanza, et al. vs. C.I.R., et al., G. R. No. L-18708, Nov. 28, 
1962:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span class="GramE">An unfair 
labor practice case involving agricultural laborers engaged in agricultural 
pursuits are</span> within the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">a</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ruling reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Camus</span> vs. Court of Agrarian Relations, L-18225, June 30, 
1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The <i>rationale</i> of these 
rulings was set in the preceding case of Santos <i>vs</i>. C.I.R., et al., G.R. 
No. L-17196, December 28, 1961, in that—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"not only because an agricultural 
laborer does not come with'" the purview of the word "employee" defined in 
Section 2(d) of R.A. 875 but also because any matter that may pertain to the 
relation of tenant and landlord cornea under the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. 
No. 1199 as amended by Republic Act No. 2263) and any controversy that may arise 
between them as an incident their relationship comes under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations created by Republic Act No. 
1267.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court of Agrarian Relations, 
expressly created for the "enforcement of <i>all</i> laws and regulations 
governing the relation of <i>capital</i> and <i>labor</i> on all agricultural 
under <i>any system of cultivation"</i> (See 1, R.A. 1267), was given 
<i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction over the entire Philippines consider, investigate, 
decide and settle <i>all</i> questions, matters, controversies, or disputes 
involving <i>all</i> those relationships established by law which determine the 
varying lights of poisons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land where 
one of the parties works the land" (Sec. 7, R.A. 1267), and that jurisdiction is 
certainly enough to include disputes over union representation of agricultural 
laborers and other workers that were given, by Section 27 of Republic Act No. 
2263, the right to form, maintain and expand their unions and organizations, 
prohibiting landholders from discouraging, initiating, dominating, assisting or 
interfering with such unions or organizations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appealed resolution of the 
respondent court argues that there would be no penalty imposable for violation 
of the laborer's rights conferred by section 27, Republic Act No. 2263, except 
by applying the Industrial Peace Act, R. A. 875. This is a mistake. That section 
was an amendment to Republic Act 1199 (Tenancy Act), and, therefore, Us 
violation would be punishable under section 57 of the latter Act, penalizing 
with a fine not exceeding two thousand pesos or imprisonment not exceeding one 
year or both any violation of its provisions; as well as under the contempt 
power conferred by section 8 of Republic Act No. 3267 on the Agrarian 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nor are we impressed by the 
consideration that the Court of Industrial Relations already has the machinery 
to deal with questions of union representation. There is no reason why the Court 
of Agrarian Relations may not set up its own organization to deal with cases 
within its jurisdiction as circumstances may require, making use of its 
rule-making power or by calling upon the opposite government offices, as its 
organic law empowers it to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent AWA calls attention to 
the fact that Republic Act No. 809 and its provisions refer to the persons 
engaged in the "sugar industry." Nothing in said Act, however, indicates any 
legislative intent to convert the agricultural laborers into industrial 
employees; the term "sugar industry" in said Act refers to sugar millers, 
planters and laborers as a whole, and has no bearing on the issue now before the 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the resolution under review is 
reversed, and the petition for certification is ordered dismissed, without 
prejudice to petitioner's seeking relief in the proper courts. No 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
