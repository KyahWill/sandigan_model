which declared applicant Vicente Reyes the true and rightful owner of the land

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1961</st1:date>,
Vicente Reyes filed an application for registration of his title to a parcel of
land situated in <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and covered by Plan Psu-189753 of the Bureau of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his application, he declared that he
acquired the land by inheritance from his father who died sometime in

the general order of default so as to include the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">movants</span> as <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above-quoted testimony of applicant, it is evident that
he considered the document marked Exhibit "D" as a contract of <st1:city><st1:place><u>Sale</u></st1:place></st1:city>
and <u>not as a mortgage</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span> contended that the words "<span class="SpellE">isinangla</span>," "<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ipananagutan</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">inutang</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">halagang</span>

manifest that the document should be treated as a mortgage, <span class="SpellE">antichresis</span>,
or <span class="SpellE">pactum</span> <span class="SpellE">commissorium</span> and
not as an absolute sale or <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 28, Brief, <span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span>-Appellants).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is of the opinion that Exhibit "D" is a
mortgage contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intention of the
parties at the time of the execution of the contract must prevail, that is, the
borrowing and lending of money with security.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The use of the word debt (<span class="SpellE">utang</span>) in an
agreement helps to point out that the transaction was intended to be a loan
with mortgage, because the term "<span class="SpellE">utang</span>"
implies the existence of a creditor-debtor relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has invariably upheld the validity
of an agreement or understanding whereby the lender of money has taken a deed
to the land as security for repayment of the loan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="GramE">fact that the real transaction between
the parties was a borrowing and lending, will, whenever, or however it may
appear, show</span> that a deed, absolute on its face was intended as a
security for money; and whenever it can be ascertained to be a security for
money, it is only a mortgage, however artfully it may be disguised."
(Villa vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>, 38 Phil. 163).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The whole case really turns on the question of whether the
written instrument in controversy was a mortgage or a conditional sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> real intention of the
parties at the time the written instrument was made must govern in the
interpretation given to it by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> correct test, where it can be applied, is the continued
existence of a debt or liability between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such exists, the conveyance may be held to
be merely a security for the debt or an indemnity against the liability."
(<span class="SpellE">Cuyugan</span> vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
34 Phil. 112).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuyugan</u></span><u> Case</u> quoted
some provisions <span style="">in </span>Jones'
Commentaries on Evidence, vol. 3, paragraphs 446-447 which are likewise
applicable to the facts of the case at bar:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"446.
<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>To show that instruments apparently
absolute are only securities</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It is an
established doctrine that a court of equity will treat a deed, absolute in
form, as a mortgage, when it is executed as security for loan of money, The
court looks beyond the terms of the instrument to the real transaction; and
when that is shown to be one of security and not of sale, it will give effect
to the actual contract of the parties."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"447.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Same--Real intention of the parties to be
ascertained</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">As</span>
we have shown in the preceding section, the <u>intention</u> of the parties <u>must
govern</u>; and it matters not what peculiar form the transaction may have
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inquiry always is, <span class="GramE">Was</span> a security for the loan of money or other property
intended?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> A debt owing to the mortgagee, or a liability incurred
for the grantor, either pre-existing or created at the time the deed is made,
is essential to give the deed the character of a mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relation of debtor and creditor must
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of the debt is one
of the tests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">In</span> construing the deed to be a mortgage, its character as
such must have existed from its very inception,--created at the time the
conveyance was made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same principle was laid down in a later case, that of <span class="SpellE">Macapinlac</span> vs. Gutierrez <span class="SpellE">Rapide</span>,
43 Phil. 781, quoting 3 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisdiction, Section 1195, wherein it
was stated:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"* </span>* * The
doctrine has been firmly established from an early day that when the character
of a <span style="">mortgage has attached at the
commencement of the transaction, so that the instrument, whatever be its form,
is regarded in equity as a mortgage, that character of mortgage must and will
always continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the instrument is in
its essence a mortgage, the parties cannot by any stipulations, however express
and posi­tive, render it anything but a mortgage or deprive it of the essential
attributes belong­ing to a mortgage in equity."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the legal effects of such Contract, Pomeroy observes:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"* </span>* * Whenever
a deed absolute on its face is thus treated as a mortgage, the parties are
clothed with all the rights, are subject to all liabilities, and are entitled
to all the remedies of ordinary mortgagors and mortgagees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grantee may maintain an action for the
foreclosure of the grantor's equity of redemp­tion; the grantor may maintain an
action to redeem and to compel a <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> upon
his payment of the debt secured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
grantee goes into possession, he is in reality a mort­gagee in possession, and
as such is liable to account for the rents and profits."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, from the nature of the transaction, appli­cant's
predecessor-in-interest is a mere mortgagee, and ownership of the thing
mortgaged is retained by <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> Beltran, the
mortgagor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgagee, however, may
recover the loan, although the mortgage document evidencing the loan was non-<span class="SpellE">registrable</span> being a purely private instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure of mortgagor to redeem the property
does not automatically vest ownership of the property to the mortgagee, which
would grant the latter the right to appropriate the thing mortgaged or dispose
of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This violates the provision of
Article 2088 of the New Civil Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The creditor cannot appropriate the things given by way of
pledge or mortgage, or dispose by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any stipulation to the contrary is null and void."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
act of applicant in registering the property in his own name upon mortgagor's
failure to redeem the property would amount to a </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pactum</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>commissorium</u></span>
</span><span style="">which is against good morals and
public policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In declaring applicant as the "true and rightful owner of
the land in question," the trial court held that applicant and his
predecessor-in-interest acquired ownership over the property by means of
prescription having been in constructive possession of the land applied for
since 1926, applying Arts. 1134 and 1137 of the New Civil Code:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1134.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Ownership
and other real rights over immovable property are acquired by ordinary
prescription through possession of ten years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1137<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-</span>Ownership and other real rights over <span class="SpellE">immovables</span>
also prescribe through uninterrupted adverse possession thereof for thirty
years, without need of title or good faith."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br style="" clear="all">
</span>

<div class="Section2">

<p class="BODY">Applicant, in his testimony on cross-examination, admitted that
he and his father did not take possession of the property but only made use of
the same for the purpose of spending vacation there, which practice they
discontinued for the last 23 years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Possession of the property must be in the concept of an owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a fundamental principle of the law of
prescription in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the case at bar, the possession of applicant was not adverse, nor continuous.</p>

<p class="BODY">An applicant for registration of title must prove his title and
should not rely on the absence or weakness of the evidence of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
purposes of prescription, there is just title when adverse claimant came into
possession of the property through one of the modes recognized by<span style=""> law for the acquisition of ownership (Art.
1129, New Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just title must
be proved and is never presumed (Art. 1131, New Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mortgage does not constitute just title on
the part of the mortgagee since ownership is retained by the mortgagor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When possession is asserted to convert itself
into ownership, a new right is sought to be created, and the law becomes more
exacting and requires posi­tive proof of title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that he is
entitled to register the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court's findings that since applicant and his father had been
continuously paying the realty taxes, that fact "constitutes strong
corroborating evidence of applicant's adverse possession," <span class="GramE">does</span> not carry much weight.<span style="">&nbsp;
