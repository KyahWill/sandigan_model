				<H3>FRANCISCO PASCUAL, PETITIONER, VS. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A shipment consisting of 5 packages of toffee and 23 packages of chocolate 
consigned to Francisco Pascual arrived at the Port of Manila on August 9, 1954 
on board the "SS KINA" under Bill of Lading No. M-9 dated August 7, 1954 and a 
commercial invoice dated August 6, 1954 in the amount of $550.00, which shipment 
was not covered by a release certificate issued by the Central Bank or any of 
its duly authorized agents. In view of the absence of a release certificate the 
Collector of Customs seized the shipment pursuant to the provisions of Section 
1363 (<i>f</i>) of the Revised Administrative Code, in relation to Central Bank 
Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. The shipment was later released under a surety bond in 
the amount of P1,790.00.
<p>After the seizure proceedings were heard, the Collector of Customs on January 
21, 1955 rendered decision forfeiting the shipment and ordering its importer to 
pay within 30 days the amount of P1,790.00 subject to the condition that if said 
amount is not paid the surety bond would be forfeited. On February 1, 1955, the 
importer appealed the decision to the Commissioner of Customs who on February 
12, 1955 affirmed it <i>in toto</i>.</p>
<p>In due time, the importer elevated the case to the Court of Tax Appeals 
contending that the seizure of his shipment was illegal not only because the 
same does not involve a dollar allocation but also because the Central Bank has 
no authority under the law to issue Circular Nos. 44 and 45 which prohibit its 
importation. After hearing was held, the Court of Tax Appeals brushed aside the 
contention of the importer and affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of 
Customs. Thereupon, it ordered the surety bond executed by the Reliance Surety 
and Insurance Company, Inc. in the amount of P1,790.00 forfeited, with costs 
against the importer. The latter interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>One of the issues raised in connection with the shipment in question is that 
the Central Bank has no authority under its charter to issue Circular No. 44 
which prohibits the release by the customs authorities of any importation not 
covered by a certificate issued by said bank or any of its duly authorized 
agents. The portion of the circular which is particularly objected to is Section 
14 which provides: "No item of import shall be released by the Bureau of Cutoms 
without the presentation of a release certificate issued by the Central Bank or 
any authorized agent bank, in a form prescribed by the Monetary Board."</p>
<p>Since the submission of this case to the Court of Tax Appeals for 
determination which calls for an interpretation of the validity of Circular Nos. 
44 and 45 of the Central Bank, several cases involving a similar question have 
been decided by this Court which now constitute a precedent decisive in the 
present case. Thus, we held therein that the Central Bank has authority to issue 
said circulars even if the same have the effect of regulating no-dollar 
importation "for the reason that the broad powers of the Central Bank, under its 
charter, to maintain our monetary stability and to preserve the international 
value of our currency, under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 265, in relation to 
Section 14 of said Act—authorizing the bank to issue such rules and regulations 
as it may consider necessary for the effective discharge of the responsibilities 
and the exercise of the powers assigned to the Monetary Board and to the Central 
Bank—<i>connote the authority to regulate no-dollar importations</i> owing to 
the influence and effect that the same may and do have, upon the stability of 
our peso and its international value" (The Commissioner of Customs, <i>et 
al</i>. vs. Eastern Sea Trading, G. R. No. L-14279, October 31, 1961; Italics 
supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> There can therefore be no 
question that the Central Bank has authority under its charter to issue Circular 
No. 44 even if its scope covers no-dollar importation as apparently is the 
shipment under consideration.</p>
<p>But it is contended that there is nothing in Circular No. 44 which provides 
for the seizure of merchandise which may be imported in violation thereof even 
if it be maintained that the same has been validly issued and so the seizure of 
said merchandise by the Collector of Customs has been made without authority of 
law. However, while it is true that said circular does not provide for the 
penalty of forfeiture in case of a violation thereof, it is nonetheless true 
that the same is subject to enforcement by the Bureau of Customs and as such is 
deemed part of the customs law under Section 1419 of the Revised Administrative 
Code. It may, therefore, be said that the shipment in question which was 
imported in violation of Circular No. 44 is subject to forfeiture under Section 
1363 (<i>f</i>) of the Revised Administrative Code which specifically provides 
that all merchandise imported <i>contrary to law</i> is subject to forfeiture. 
Moreover, although a circular duly issued is not strictly a statute or a law it 
has however the force and effect of law according to the settled jurisprudence 
in this jurisdiction. A case we have recently decided is Po Eng Trading vs. 
Commissioner of Customs, (110 Phil., 83) wherein we held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Central Bank Circular No. 44, implementing Republic Act 265, has the affect 
of a Customs law as defined in the last paragraph of Section 1419, Revised 
Administrative Code. In accordance with Section 1250 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, the Collector of Customs has jurisdiction, indeed, has the 
duty to exercise jurisdiction to prevent importation or otherwise secure 
compliance with all legal requirements in the case of merchandise of 
<i>prohibited importation or subject to importation only upon conditions 
prescribed by law</i>. In the exercise of this jurisdiction, he may subject to 
forfeiture cargoes and other objects of prohibited importation, in accordance 
with Section 1363 (<i>f</i>), Revised Administrative Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no point to make a distinction between merchandise of "prohibited 
importation" and those "imported contrary to law" used in Section 1363 
(<i>f</i>) of the Revised Administrative Code considering that no such 
distinction is made in Central Bank Circular No. 44. This circular punishes the 
importation of any merchandise whether prohibited or otherwise if the same is 
effected without the release certificate issued by said bank or any of its 
authorized agents. The distinction that petitioner makes is therefore of no 
legal consequence.</p>
<p>It is finally contended that the penalty of forfeiture imposed by the customs 
authorities under Section 1363 (<i>f</i>) of the Revised Administrative Code is 
unauthorized even if the same is violative of Central Bank Circular No. 44, for 
the reason that the only penal clause contained in its charter for such 
violation is a fine or imprisonment and not forfeiture. Petitioner invokes 
Section 34 of Republic Act No. 265 which provides that any person or entity who 
violates said Act, "shall be punished by a fine of not more than P20,000.00 or 
by imprisonment of not more than five years", which being a special law should 
prevail over the provisions of the Revised Administrative Code. The trial court 
has correctly answered this question in its resolution dated March 26, 1957 oh 
the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner, which we hereunder quote 
with approval:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Petitioner has lost sight of the fact that his act of 'importing contrary to 
law' entails two penalties—one penalty for violation of Central Bank Circular 
No. 44 as prescribed by Section 34 of Republic Act No. 265 directed principally 
against the person of the offender and which may be had in a criminal 
prosecution involving an action <i>in personam</i>, and the other penalty of 
forfeiture imposed by Section 1363 (f) of the Revised Administrative Code 
directed primarily against the goods rather than the offender and which may be 
had in action <i>in rem</i> (see Origet vs. U.S. 125, U.S. 240, 246-247; 31 L. 
Ed. 743, 746-747). The two penalties being distinct and different, the 
forfeiture may be enforced against the goods by proceedings <i>in rem</i> 
independently of the criminal prosecution against the offender (Origet vs. U.S., 
<i>supra</i>). The imposition of one does not preclude the imposition of the 
other, for it is a well-established rule that forfeiture proceedings stand 
independent of and are wholly unaffected by any criminal proceeding <i>in 
personam</i> (23 Am. Jur. 618). For while punishment for the crime and 
forfeiture of the goods might be coincident, they are not necessarily so (U.S. 
vs. 25 pkgs. of Panama Hats, 231 U.S. 358, 362, 58 L. Ed. 267, 269). Thus, while 
it is true that the Bureau of Customs is not authorized to impose the penalty 
prescribed by section 34 of Republic Act No. 265 for violation of Central Bank 
Circular No. 44, there is nothing to preclude the Bureau of Customs from 
imposing the penalty of forfeiture of the goods or merchandise the importation 
of which has been effected or attempted contrary to law in accordance with 
section 1363 (<i>f</i>) of the Revised Administrative Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
petitioner.</p>
