				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A petition for review by certiorari from the decision of the
Workmen's Compensation Com­mission reversing the decision of the Hearing
Officer, Department of Labor, Regional Office No. 1, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
awarding compensation bene­fits to the petitioner Juan <span class="SpellE">Isberto</span>
in the total amount of P5<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>, including attorney's
fees, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that petitioner Juan <span class="SpellE">Isberto</span>
was first employed as Construction Foreman, emergency status, on <st1:date year="1951" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1951</st1:date>, in the Office of the
District Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, thereafter, occupied various positions in
an emer­gency capacity, and on <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1957</st1:date>, he was ap­pointed Building Foreman with permanent status,
hav­ing a salary of P2<span class="GramE">,040.00</span> per annum or P170.00
monthly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As building foreman, in-charge
of the 5th Congress­ional District of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, his
duties consisted of supervision, investigation and completion of projects in
the entire 5th District which projects were for the construction and repair of
schools, markets and other public buildings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The nature of his work required him to take public conveyances, and when
the projects were in the barrios, he had to take animal drawn vehicles and
sometimes had to hike the distance if the place was not accessible by any means
of transportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1957</st1:date>,
petitioner filed sick leave of absence due to pains at his back, the history
and description of which according to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gudelia</span> <span class="SpellE">Nicu</span>-Jose of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Eastern</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Emergency</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, were as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Started as intermittent recur­rent attacks of
severe pains at the lumbar region with tenderness of firm pressure over the
affected area and abnormal limitation of mobility.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Spasm of the lumbar muscles, de­crease of <span class="SpellE">lumbrosacral</span> flexibility, limitation of straight leg <span class="GramE">raising</span> by pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See
G.S. Form No. 41, Medical Certificate, <span class="GramE">dated</span> <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1958</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The patient was confined at the said
Hospital from <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="12">De­cember 23, 1957</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His sickness was diagnosed as
"Tuberculosis of the bones or Potts de­cease".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During his confinement in the hospital, he <span class="GramE">was visited</span> by his immediate supervisor, engineer Pa­dilla,
but neither medical nor hospital expenses have ever been extended to him by his
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1961</st1:date>, he was pronounced to have
completely recovered.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1960" day="19" month="12">December
 19, 1960</st1:date>, when the petitioner was already in progress of complete
recovery, he filed a Notice of Injury and Claim for compensation with the
Department of Labor, Regional Office No, 1 at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the Hearing Officer
awarded compensation only to be reversed by the Workmen's Compensation
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re-consideration thereof was
sought by the petitioner but denied by the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in
its resolution of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that under the facts of the case, the law on
the issue involved, is Section 2 of Act 3428, which provides that when an
employee contracts tuberculosis or other illness directly caused by employment,
or either aggravated by or the result of the nature of such employment, his employer
shall pay compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents argue, on the other hand, that from the facts of
the case, there is no showing that claimant had any accidental injury during
the period of his employment that may have traumatized the spinal column which
localized the tuberculosis germs and be sick of Tuberculosis of the bones or <span class="SpellE">Pott's</span> disease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither could the nature of his work be the direct cause of
claimant-petitioner's illness since there is no evidence indicating or tending
to show that said illness was inherent in his work or occupation or the natural
result thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no quarrel as to this sickness of the petitioner -
Tuberculosis of the bones or <span class="SpellE">Pott's</span> di­sease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted that petitioner was in perfect
health when he entered the service in 1951, until he began feeling pains in his
back sometime in September, 1957, only to be discovered that he was sick of
tuberculosis of the bones; and that he had continued per­forming same kind of
work throughout the period of his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time and again, it has been held by this Court, as in the case of
<span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> vs. Workmen's Compensa­tion Commission, G.R.
No. L-22774, November 21, 1966, that "the laborer is relieved from the
burden of proving causation once the disease is shown to have arisen in the
course of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disease
having arisen in the course of employment, it is presumed by law that it arose
out of it." It cannot be denied that petitioner as foreman in the whole
5th Congress­ional District of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, the nature
of his work, requiring continuous or frequent traveling or hiking in the
different municipalities and barrios, is na­turally exposed to all kinds of
dust and dirt, and to the elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
even sometimes missed his meals.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In another decision of this Court, it was
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"while it is true that 'lobar
pneumonia', is directly caused by the virus known as '<span class="SpellE">pneumoccus</span>',
and as such is not an occupational disease, where it appears that when he
contracted the sickness, he was well in the course of his employment as he was
doing then his usual daily chore, it is but fair that he can be com­pensated as
required by law." <span class="GramE">(Manila Railroad Co. vs. WCC, et al., G.R.
No.</span> L-19377, <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1964</st1:date>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the law, it is not required that the employment be the sole
factor in the growth, develop­ment or acceleration of his illness to entitle
peti­tioner to the benefits provided therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is enough if his employment had contributed, even in a small degree,
to the development or acceleration of the disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Manila Railroad Co. vs.
Pineda, G.R. No.</span> L-19773, <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="5">May
 30, 1964</st1:date>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Another point raised by the petitioner is the failure of
respondents to comply with Sections 37 and 45 of Act 3428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 37 requires the employers to submit
to the Commissioner a report of accident or sickness, whether fatal or not,
received by his em­ployee; and while Section 45 requires that before an
employer can be allowed the right to controvert an employee's claim for
compensation, he shall either on or before the fourteenth day of disability or
within ten days after he has actual knowledge of the alleged <span class="GramE">accident</span>
or sickness, file a notice with the Commis­sioner that compensation is not
being paid and the reason why the same is not being paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, it appears that no less
than his immediate supervisor Engineer Padilla learned of his illness, not only
as a matter of fact when he flied his sick leave of absence with pay, but also
because Engineer Padilla even visited him at his sick bed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondents maintain that since this defense
of failure to controvert was not raised either before the hearing officer or
before the Workmen's Compensation Commission, petitioner cannot now, for the
first time raise this issue on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the defense must be deemed waived and cannot be raised, as it is,
for the first time in <span class="GramE">petitioner's</span> brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The re­cords will bear it out that when the
respondents filed its motion for reconsideration from the ruling or decision of
the Hearing Officer, awarding compensation, one of its grounds was prescription
or the fil­ing of claim was out of time; and in the answer to the motion for
reconsideration filed by the petitioner, he categorically stated therein the
non-compliance by the respondent of Sections 37 and 45 of Act 3428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the Hearing Officer denied the
motion for recon­sideration of the respondents, it is safe to assume that the
contention of the respondent was denied al­though "sub <span class="SpellE">silencio</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, therefore, for failure to controvert,
compensation must be awarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">And since there is no dispute regarding the total amount of P5<span class="GramE">,250.00</span> awarded by the Hearing Officer, the full
compensation for the same as given, is war­ranted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is rendered setting aside the decision
appealed from, and ordering the respondent to pay the petitioner the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><i>Concepcion</i></span><i>, C.J., Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, Castro, Fernando, JJ.,</i> <span class="GramE">concur</span>.</p>
