<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">Return of P391.50 and the
nullification of the forfeiture are</span> sought herein by petitioner.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. From the factual setting, we go to the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 311 of the Bell Trade Act - the
applicable statute - reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 311.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FREE ENTRY OF UNITED STATES ARTICLES.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">During the period from the day
after the </span>date of the enactment of this Act to <st1:date year="1954" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1954</st1:date>, both dates inclusive, <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

for consumption shall be admitted into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
free of ordinary customs duty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">The term "United states
article" is defined in paragraph (a) </span>(5), Section 2 of the same
Bell Trade Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote:</p>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">"(5) The term 'United
States article' means </span>an article which is the product of the United
States, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">unless, in the case of an article

more than twenty per centum of the value of<span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">
the article imported into the Philippines, the value </span>of such article to
be determined in accordance with, and as of the time provided by, the customs
laws of the Philippines in effect at the time of importation of such
article.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<span style="letter-spacing: 7pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Contemplated in the statutory definition of the term "United
States article" are two groups of tax-free products, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">those
produced in the United States which are "wholly of the </span>growth,
product or manufacture of the United States";<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) <span style="letter-spacing: 0.25pt;">those produced in the United States,
"with the use of materials </span>imported into the United States (except
from the Philippines) the aggregate value" of which "at the time of
importation into the <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">Unite</span>d<span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;"> </span>States" does not exceed twenty per
centum of the value of the article exported to the Philippines, as determined
by our customs <span style="letter-spacing: -2.95pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a fill-in, Rule 3(a), Section 3 of the
Philippine Tariff Act </span>of 1909, now Section 201 of the Tariff and Customs

rate of duty, the duty shall be assessed upon the actual market value or

the Philippine Islands</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="NUM">2. We now address ourselves to the <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">mechanics </span>of customs law application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A known characteristic of our revenue
statutes is that exemption from payment <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
must be construed strictly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, we
hasten to add, is in line with the general rule that everyone must bear his
share of the expenses of the Government.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="NUM">3. In this backdrop, we examine consignee's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its posture is that the zinc oxide dry

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">The Tax Court denying
probative value to the two documents </span>expressed itself in the following
terms:</p>

no foreign materials other than those of the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Philippines
were used at any stage in the manufac­</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">ture
or production of the same because, in the absence</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;"> of a contrary proof, a shipper which did </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">not manufacture or produce the article cannot be </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">presumed to have knowledge of the source of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">We find ourselves unwilling to

"twenty per centum of the </span>value of the articles imported into the

mentions Section 312 of the United States Tariff Act of 1930.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And a reading of said Section <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">312 under whose provisions the smelting and
refining warehouse at </span>Palmerton was established, would show that the
zinc oxide in controversy may have been produced either from wholly imported
raw materials, or from materials of home - together with foreign -
production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 312 says:</p>

a bonded smelting warehouse without the payment of duties thereon, and there
smelted or <span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">refined, or both, together with

which would have been payable </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.8pt;">on such
ores and crude metals <u>if</u> <u>entered</u> <u>for</u> <u>consumption</u></span>
at the time of their importation, and the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">several

bonded smelting or </span>refining warehouses <u>without</u> <u>first</u>
paying the corresponding import<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;"> duties

authorities to show that those packages were "Under </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">Bond".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Which means that no customs duties were actually paid in </span>the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

the manufacture of the zinc oxide therein contained, as provided in the United

obviously to prevent the articles (zinc oxide) <u>from</u> <u>being</u> <u>diverted</u>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">The net result is that the

<p class="NUM"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">5. We now dwell on the

the Court of Tax Appeals correctly found that there was <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">no justification to reverse the findings and conclusions of the </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">Commissioner of Customs "that the 118 bags of

entry duty-free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This only goes to </span>show

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">The red labels were attached
to the packages, it is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">But they were not sent here in advance with the

within the compass of dutiable articles under the Bell </span><span style="letter-spacing: 1.05pt;">Trade Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, at this end, it is well nigh impossible for the </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">importer - unless informed before entry - to know
