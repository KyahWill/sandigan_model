				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal (concerning confiscation of a bond filed in a criminal
case) was certified to Us by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution of
21 July 1961 , in CA-G. R. No. 01323-GR, as it involves purely
questions of law.
<p> Fieldmen's Insurance Co., Inc., posted a bond of P3,500.00 for the
provisional liberty of Frederick G. Weber, a German alien accused of
"Falsification of Public or Official Document", docketed as Criminal
Case No. 49099 in the Court of First Instance of Manila, in an
information dated 17 July 1959. Hon. Judge Jesus Y. Perez, presiding
over Branch III, set the arraignment of the accused on 3 February 1960
. Since the accused did not appear on that day, the court on the same
day issued an order as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "On motion of counsel for the accused Frederick G.
Weber on the ground that said accused is still weak and cannot come to
court as attested to by the verified Medical certificate issued by Dr.
Pedro R. Arenas, let the arraignment of the accused sot for today be
postponed to February 27, 1960, at 8:00 o'clock in the morning. </p>
  <p>
The Chief Medical Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation is
hereby ordered to conduct a medical examination of the accused
Frederick G. Weber, who resides at 1075 Santiago Street, Paco, Manila,
to determine whether said accused is in a physical condition to appear
before this court for arraignment and to submit his report of said
examination as soon as possible.</p>
  <p> Let a copy of this order he furnished the Chief Medical Officer of the NBI."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In compliance with this order, Dr. Rosalino V. Reyes, Chief
Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation, examined
the accused personally on 4 February 1960 , and filed a 3 page report
to the court, dated 15 February 1960 . In his report, Dr, Reyes said,
in part that the accused "is one who is prone to the extent of feigning
or pretending to be physically weak by all means to justify his failure
to appear in court in a previously set date", and recommended that the
accused be placed in a suitable institution under a competent
government neurologist for observation and examination.</p>
<p> On 27 February 1960 , accused again failed to appear for
arraignment, and his counsel asked for a postponement of the
arraignment, claiming1 that the accused had a nervous breakdown. In
view thereof, the court <em>a quo</em> forthwith issued an orderâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * that herein accused Frederick G. Weber be
confined in the National Mental Hospital for examination and
observation as to his mental state to determine whether or not he is in
a condition to appear for arraignment in this case. Should said accused
fail to submit himself for confinement in the National Mental Hospital
within one (1) week after receipt of copy of this order, let the
corresponding warrant for the arrest of said accused issued forthwith
in order that he may be arraigned."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the meantime, on 10 March 1960, accused, through counsel, filed
a motion praying1 for a one-year postponement of the trial of his case,
which motion was accompanied by sworn affidavits of four doctors
certifying as to the alleged weak physical state or, condition of the
accused. The lower court denied the one-year motion for postponement,
in its order dated 26 March 1960 :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * Considering that the defendant has not yet
been arraigned so that the issue in this ease is not yet joined, the
defendant's motion is premature.</p>
  <p> It appearing that the
defendant had not complied with the order of this Court dated February
27, 1960 ordering said defendant to be confined for examination and
observation as to his mental state in the National Mental Hospital, the
Court hereby orders that the corresponding warrant for the arrest of
the defendant for failure to appear for arraignment issue forthwith. <em>The
bond filed for the provisional release of the defendant is hereby
declared forfeited in favor of the government. The bondsmen of the
defendant are hereby given a, period of thirty (30) days within which
to produce the person of said defendant and show cause why judgment in
the amount of their bond should not he finally entered against them."</em> (Italic supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The bondsmen, Fieldmen's Insurance Company, Inc., filed a "Motion
for Extension of Time to Produce the Accused", dated 2 May I960, and
the trial court, on 6 May 1960 , granted the bondsmen up to 28 May 1960
to produce the body of the accused, with the warning, however, that it
would be the last extension. Since appellant corporation failed to
produce the body of the accused for arraignment on 28 May 1960 , the
court <em>a quo</em>, on 23 June 1960 , ordered the issuance of the
corresponding writ for the execution of the total amount of the bond.
On 14 July I960, appellant-bondsmen, in a "Motion for Partial Execution
of Bond", pleaded that its liability be reduced to 10 % of the amount
on the ground that the accused was seriously ill. The said motion was
not, however, accompanied by a sworn medical certificate. The lower
court held in abeyance the consideration of this last motion for
partial execution, and at the same time ordered again the Chief
Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation to submit
another report, in its order dated 26 July 1960 . On the following day,
however, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> set aside its order of 26 July 1960 , thereby
denying the motion for partial execution of the bond. In view of the
importance of this last order of the lower court of 27 July 1960 , the
same is hereby quoted <em>in toto</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "This Court has issued an order dated July 26, 1960
ordering the Chief Medical-Legal Officer of the NBI to examine the
herein accused for the purpose of determining whether or not said
accused is really seriously ill as he claims and holding1 in abeyance
the resolution of the motion dated July 14, 1960 filed by the accused's
bondsmen, Fieldman's Insurance Co., Inc., for the partial execution of
the accused's bailbond until the report of the Chief Medico-Legal
Officer of the NBI is submitted to this Court. However, on examining
the records of this case, the Court has found out that the Chief
Medico-Legal Officer of the NBI, upon order of this Court dated
February 8, 1960, bad already physically examined the accused and had
submitted his report, dated February 15, 1960, wherein the said Chief
Medico-Legal Officer had found out that the accused "is one who is
prone to the extent of feigning or pretending to be physically weak by
all moans to justify his failure to appear in court". The report
recommended that the accused be placed in a suitable institution and
under a government competent neurologist for a sufficient time for a
more thorough examination and observation of his mental state. In view
of this recommendation and, in view of the accused's persistent claim
that he is ill and his continued failure to appear for arraignment, the
court issued an order on February 27, 1960 directing that the accused
submit himself, within one week from receipt of copy of said order, to
the National Mental Hospital for observation and examination as to his
mental state to determine whether or not he is in a condition to appear
for arraignment but the accused ignored the aforesaid order and never
submitted himself for examination at the National Mental Hospital even
up to the present time. He not only defied the court's order but
consistently failed to appear for arraignment thereby resulting in the
issuance of the order of March 26, 1960 directing for the arrest of the
accused and the confiscation of his bailbond. The accused's bondsmen
was unable to produce the person of the accused despite an extension of
time expiring on May 28, 1960 within which to produce the accused, for
which reason, the Court on June 23, 1960 issued an order executing the
accused's bailbond. The bondsmen now asks for the reduction of its
liability on its bond to 10% of the amount thereof but the Court finds
no justification for such reduction.</p>
  <p> Wherefore, the Court
hereby sets aside its order of July 26, 1960 , and denies, as it hereby
denies, the motion for partial execution filed by the accused's
bondsmen.</p>
  <p> Let a copy of this order be furnished the Chief,
Medical Legal Officer of the NBI who is hereby ordered not to proceed
anymore with the examination of the accused."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It is from this last order that the bondsmen appealed.</p>
<p> In view of the damaging report of Dr. Rosalino V. Reyes of the NBI,
it was incumbent upon the bondsmen to show to the complete satisfaction
of the court that the accused was seriously ill. No expert testimony
whatsoever was offered to convince the court that Frederick G. Weber
was not pretending to be sick. The bondsmen could have presented easily
any of the four doctors to testify as to his alleged malady, or it
could have requested the court to see for itself his real condition.
Appellant could likewise have surrendered Weber any time. In short, the
bonding company did not take any steps to protect its interest. It did
not exert any effort to show its good faith in endeavoring to comply
with the orders of the court. Mere allegation that the accused is
seriously ill is not sufficient. In fact, there are strong grounds to
suspect that the accused was purposely delaying the trial of his case
of which appellant may be chargeable, at least, with constructive
knowledge.</p>
<p> However, no permanent injury to public interest appear to have been
caused by the appellant's default, for our examination of the records
of the Court of First Instance of Manila shows that the accused Weber
has been subsequently arraigned and tried. We are, therefore, of the
opinion that the bondsman is entitled to a mitigation of liability
(Peo. <em>vs</em>. Bustamante, G. R. No. L-13665, 24 Sept. 1959 ), although not to the ten <em>per centum</em>
prayed for, which would be irrisory and will stimulate, rather than
deter, bondsmen to hinder speedy trials and prompt dispatch of cases. A
reduction of the forfeiture to P1,000.00 would serve the interests of
justice in this regard.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the order appealed from is modified, and the forfeiture
reduced to P1,000.00, to be paid by the appellant-bondsmen within five
(5) days from finality of this decision. Without costs in this instance.</p>
<p> Parenthetically, the Court notes the conspicuous failure of the
Office of the Solicitor General to file the government's brief
notwithstanding six extensions totalling 85 days granted by the Court
of Appeals, aside from the reglementary 30 days provided for in the
Rules of Court. In the interest of public service, let a copy of this
decision be furnished the Secretary of Justice for whatever remedial
measure he may deem proper to take. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador , Concepcion , Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
