				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (C. T. A.
Case No. 762) sustaining a decision of respondent Commissioner of Customs
forfeiting, in favor of the Government, 760 cartons of Chesterfield and Came'
cigarettes with blue seals but without internal revenue strip stamps.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reproduced below are the undisputed findings of facts in the
decision' appealed from:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 2:00 a. m. on September 16, 1957, the M/V '<span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>' a coastwise vessel coming from <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>
docked at the port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> on her <span style="">way </span>to Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon a confidential telegraphic report
from an informer in <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span> that the said vessel was
carrying a substantial quantity of smuggled foreign cigarettes, the Customs
authorities of the port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> conducted a search of
the vessel which eventually <span class="SpellE">Ied</span> to the discovery of
eight cases containing SIX HUNDRED FIFTY (650) CARTONS of Chesterfield
cigarettes and ONE HUNDRED TEN (110) CARTONS of Camel cigarettes without the
required Internal 'Revenue strip stamps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon investigation it was also discovered that the subject merchandise
was covered by Bill of Lading No. 24-A (Exhibit B) with 'personal belong­ings'
as its declaration and correspondingly entered into the manifest of the vessel
likewise with 'personal belongings' as the noted description, and with Sultan
Pula of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span> as the consignor and a certain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carlos Valdez as the consignee in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon further in­vestigation, however, it was
found that a woman pas­senger was accompanying the subject merchandise
appearing later to be Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Vierneza</span>, the present claimant, who all the while holds the
bill of lading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that
when Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Vierneza</span> was questioned during the course
of the search she disclaimed under oath (Exhibit H) ownership of the
merchandise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Believing that there is <span style="">a </span>strong evidence of <span style="">violations </span>of Customs laws, the Collector of
Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> seized the merchandise and instituted
the forfeiture proceedings for violation of Section 2530 (f), (g) and (m)-4 of
the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines and Section 174 of the Internal
Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After complying with the
procedural requirements of the law, the Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> conducted a hearing of the case x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> (and) on <st1:date year="1958" day="5" month="2">Feb­ruary
 5, 1958</st1:date>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
rendered his decision forfeiting the subject merchandise in favor of the
Government <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> (pp. 42-43, Customs records.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The claimant of the merchandise, petitioner herein, appealed
in due time from the decision of the Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to the Commissioner of Customs who affirmed the
decision of the Collector, with the modification that the forfeiture was
sustained, among others, under paragraph (m-1) of Section 2530 of the Tariff
and Customs Code instead of under paragraph (m-4) of the same section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> ."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Elevated to the Court of Tax Appeals, the decision of respondent
Com­missioner of Customs <span style="">was </span>affirmed,
the said court " (f)<span class="SpellE">inding</span> that the Collector of
Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> had jurisdiction to order the seizure
and forfeiture of said cigarettes and that the forfeiture of the same is in
accordance with Section 2530 (f) of the Tariff and Customs Code". <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thus, petitioner, who claimed to have merely
purchased the cigarettes in the open market in <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>);
now turns to us for relief, advancing the following assignment of errors:</p>

<blockquote>"1. The Court of Tax Appeals erred in affirming the decision
of the respondent finding that the Col­lector of Customs for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
acted with jurisdiction in instituting seizure proceedings against the
merchandise herein involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. The Court of Tax Appeals erred in affirming the decision of the
respondent finding that the merchandise involved are liable to the penalty of
forfeiture (under Section 2530 (f) of the Tariff and Customs Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. The Court of Tax Appeals erred in not finding that the
merchandise involved which were seized and libeled for alleged violation of
particular provisions of <span style="">law </span>can not be legally forfeited for violation of any other
provision of law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">All three
assigned errors are untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner argues that the Collector of
Customs of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>, who has "jurisdiction over all
matters arising from the enforcement of tariff and </span>customs <span style="">laws within his collection district" as
provided for in Section 703 of the </span>Tariff and <span style="">Customs Code, is exclusively authorized to proceed against the
cigarettes in question inasmuch as the smuggling was allegedly perpetrated in
his col­lection district.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
petitioner concludes that the seizure and forfeiture thereof by the Collector
of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> is irregular and illegal for lack </span>of
<span style="">jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, because Section 703, on which
petitioner's conclusion is premised, is legally non-existent, the same having
been </span>vetoed by <span style="">the President.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Secondly, the Tariff and Customs Code
clearly </span>empowers, the <span style="">Bureau of
Customs to prevent and suppress smuggling and other frauds upon the Customs
[Sec. 602 (b)] over all seas within the jurisdiction of </span>the Philippines <span style="">and over all coasts, ports, airports,
harbors, bays, rivers and inland waters navigable from the sea and, in case of
"hot pursuit", even beyond the maritime zone (Sec. 603).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the due enforcement of this function, a
Collector, among others, is authorized to search and seize </span>(Sec. <span style="">2203), at any place within the jurisdiction
of the said Bureau (Sec. </span>2204, sec. par.), <span style="">any vessel, aircraft, cargo, article, animal or other movable </span>property
<span style="">when the same is subject to forfeiture
or liable Lot any fine imposed under customs and tariff laws (Sec. 2205).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of no moment where the in­troduction of
the property subject to forfeiture took place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, to our mind, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)t is the right of
an officer of the customs to seize goods which are sus­pected to have been
introduced into the country </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">violation
of the revenue </span>laws <span style="">not only in
his own district, but also in any other district than his own" [Taylor vs.
U. S., 44 U. S. (3 How.) 197, 11 L. ed. 559].<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any other cons­truction of </span>the Tariff and <span style="">Customs </span>Code, such as the one proposed by peti­tioner, would
virtually place the Collector of <span style="">Customs
in </span><span style="">a </span>straitjacket and
render inutile his <span style="">police power of
search and seizure, thereby frustrating effective enforcement of the measures
provided in the Code to prevent and suppress smuggling and other frauds upon
the Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This we can not sanction by
subscribing to petitioner's conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Code, as a revenue </span>law, <span style="">is
to </span>be construed <span style="">to carry out the
intention of Congress in enacting it and as would most effectually accomplish
its objects (15 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. </span>304).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also attacks the jurisdiction of the Collector of <span style="">Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> on
the </span>ground that the forfeiture of the cigarettes is not in ac­cordance
'with Section 2531 of the Code, as the same were, at <span style="">the time of seizure, no longer in </span>the custody and control of the
Bureau <span style="">of Customs nor </span>in the
hands, or subject to control, of the importer:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>original owner, <span style="">consignee, agent
or person with knowledge </span>dirt the same were imported contrary to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, we disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
forfeiture is effected precisely in accordance with Section 2531 afore-cited,
which plainly provides "that forfeiture shall be <span style="">effected when and while </span>the article is <span style="">in </span>the custody <u>or within <span style="">the jurisdiction </span>of the customs authority</u> ... <u>or in the
hands or subject to the control of</u> some <u>person who shall</u> receive, <u>conceal,
buy</u>, sell or <u>transport</u> the <span style="">same
.... </span><u>with knowledge that the article was imported</u> . . . . .<u>contrary
to law”</u> (Emphasis supplied). There can be no question that the cigarettes
involved were seized and forfeited at the port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
which is within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Customs and, as will be shown
later, while the cigarettes were subject to the control of petitioner, who
bought, concealed, and transported the same aboard the M/V "<span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>" with knowledge that they were imported
contrary to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is a
settled jurisprudence that forfeiture proceedings are in the nature of
proceedings <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> wherein the
jurisdiction to proceed against the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> is
vested <span style="">in </span>the court of the
district where the same is found or seized (25 C. 572).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, who has the authority under the Tariff and Customs
Code to institute forfeiture proceedings, lawfully assume jurisdiction to
forfeit, in favor of the Government, the smuggled cigarettes found and seized
within his collection district.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner next argues
that the cigarettes in question are not mer­chandise of prohibited importation
inasmuch as she had purchased the same in the open market in <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>; which goes to show that she is not the importer,
original owner, consignee, agent or person who effected the importation
thereof; and that, in the absence of evidence that she bought the same with
knowledge that they were imported contrary to law in accordance with Section
2531, as the lack of internal revenue' stamps is not evidence of illegal
importation much less her knowledge thereof, the said cigarettes are not
subject to forfeiture under Section 2530 (f) of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the first time that this question has been posed
before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Gigare</span> vs. Commissioner of Customs (G. R. No. L-21376,
August 29, 1966, 17 S. C. R. A. 1001), we disposed of the <span style="">same by holding that "(s)<span class="SpellE">ince</span>, </span>admittedly, 'ale internal revenue tax on the <span style="">cigarettes in dis­</span>pute has not been
paid, it is clear that said cigarettes fall within the category of 'merchandise
of prohibited importation,' the importation of <span style="">which is </span>contrary to law and may justify its forfeiture, as
provided in Sections 1363 (f) and 1364 of the Revised Administrative
Code," which correspond to Sections 2530 (f) an 2531, respectively, of the
Tariff and Customs Code. "Moreover, the blue se affixed on said commodities
prove satisfactorily that they are foreign products Again, the importation
thereof into the Philippines is attested by the presence of said products
within our jurisdiction" (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And concerning petitioner'<span style="">s </span>knowledge
of these facts, the following disquisition by the Court of Tax <span style="">Appeals </span>lengthily quoted <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">Gigare</span> case, finds significant application in the case at
bar:</p>

<blockquote>"Were the cigarettes in question illegally im­ported into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We <span style="">are
of the opinion </span>that the Commissioner of Customs should be sustained in
his finding that the cigarettes in question were im­ported illegally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of Philippine internal revenue
strip <span style="">stamps on cigarettes indicates
that they are either manufactured clandestinely within the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philip</span>pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or imported illegally into the country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, concomitant circumstances militate against the
manufacture <u>clandestinely</u> within the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of the cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affixture of blue
seals on the packs of the cigarettes, the wrappers, the purchase of the cigarettes
in the open market of <span class="SpellE">Jol<span style="">o</span></span><span style="">, </span>a place
where American and other foreign-made cigarettes are, of common knowledge,
frequently smuggled from Borneo ..... and the failure of-petitioner to show
that the cigarettes in question were <span style="">locally
</span>manufactured rule out the possibility that the cigarettes in question
were manufactured in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, we are constrained to conclude
that these cigarettes were foreign (American) made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were merchandise of prohibited
importation, the impartation of which was contrary to law, and should be
forfeited under Section 1363 (f) of the Revised Administrative Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">xxxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span>;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"The fact that petitioner is merely a buyer of the
cigarettes in the open market of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span> does not-render
the cigarettes immune from the penalty of for­feiture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because forfeiture proceedings are
instituted-against the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> (cigarettes) .....
and, by express provision of Section 1364 of the Revised Admin­istrative Code,
the forfeiture shall occur while the mer­chandise is in the hands or subject to
<span style="">control of </span>some person who shall
receive, conceal, buy, sell, or transport the same with knowledge that the
merchandise was imported contrary to law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner cannot but be charged with the knowledge that the cigarettes
in question were imported contrary to law, for if it were otherwise, why were
these cigarettes concealed on board the vessel . . . . ?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did she deny owner­ship over said
cigarettes? For what plausible reason was she afraid of detention? What impelled
her to believe that she would be detained by the customs authorities?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To uphold the claim of petitioner and forego
the <span style="">forfeiture would be giving a chance
to accessories after </span>the 'fact of smugglers of foreign cigarettes to ply
their trade <span style="">with impunity and with
sanction of the </span>courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the
executive department could not curb, that <span style="">is rampant smuggling of foreign cigarettes, the courts </span>should not
tolerate . . . . “ </p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner finally
contends that the decision of the Commissioner of Customs libeling and
forfeiting the cigarettes involved in the present case for violation of Section
2530 (m-1) of the Tariff and Customs Code is unconstitutional, in view of the
fact that she was allegedly not afforded an opportunity to defend the
cigarettes against such charge, said section not being one of the original
grounds cited by the Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in
forfeiting the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The contention has no
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the appellate power of
the Commissioner of Customs to review seizure and protest cases is not limited
to a review of the issues raised on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He may affirm, modify or reverse <span style="">the
decision of </span>the Collector (Section 2313) on other questions provided
that his findings and conclusions are, as in the case at bar, supported by
evidence It is of no consequence whatsoever what were the original grounds of
the seizure and forfeiture if, in point of fact, the goods are by law subject
to forfeiture [Wood vs. U. S., 16 Pet. (U.S.) 342, 10 L. ed. 987].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there is evidence on record showing that
the cigarettes in question were imported and introduce <span style="">into the country without passing </span>through <span style="">a </span>customs house, the same may be forfeited under said Section
2530 (m-1.) of the Code, <span style="">notwithstanding
that it is not one of the original charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>As <span style="">we </span>held in <span class="SpellE">Que</span> Po Lay <span style="">vs. </span>Central
Bank <span style="">et al. (104 Phil. </span>853),
what counts is not the designation of the particular section of the law that
has been violated but the description of the violation in the <span style="">seizure </span>report.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>
