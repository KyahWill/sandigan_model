				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the general elections held on November 8, 1955 in the municipality of 
Carigara, Leyte, Jose Aguilar and Herculano Grapilon were elected mayor and 
vice-mayor, respectively. Thereafter, both qualified for and assumed office in 
accordance with law.
<p>On March 6, 1957, in compliance with a resolution duly approved by the 
municipal council, Mayor Aguilar left Carigara for Manila on official business. 
On that same date appellee inquired from the municipal secretary if it was true 
that the mayor had left for Manila, to which the municipal secretary replied in 
the affirmative, informing him besides that Mayor Aguilar left for Manila on 
official business, without designating anybody as acting municipal mayor. After 
receiving the secretary's answer appellee informed him "that I assume office as 
acting municipal mayor effective today and for the duration of his absence 
pursuant to the provision of Section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code" 
(Exhibit A). He addressed a similar notice to the chief of police of the 
municipality and to the provincial governor of Leyte. In his notice (by 
telegram) to the latter, appellee also informed him that the municipal secretary 
had refused to recognize him as acting mayor and asked for advice. Answering 
petitioner's telegram, the provincial governor, under date of March 7, 1957, 
wrote him an official letter in which he said that, in view of the reasons 
therein stated, "in the absence of the municipal mayor when such absence is for 
official purpose he may not leave the office to the vice-mayor and there shall 
not be an acting mayor" (Annex B to Exhibit G, page 10 of the Record of 
Exhibits).</p>
<p>On March 11, 1957, alleging that the municipal council, the municipal 
secretary Felipe Lianza aid the chief of police Ulpiano Arpon had refused to 
recognize him as acting mayor and had excluded him from the use and enjoyment of 
the office of municipal mayor, appellee filed with the lower court a petition 
for mandamus praying that judgment be rendered requiring the therein respondents 
to (1) recognize, submit to, and respect his authority as acting municipal 
mayor; (2) open, unlock and allow his entry into the office of the municipal 
mayor in the Municipal Hall of Carigara, Leyte; and (3) perform their duties 
according to law and cooperate with their legitimate superior—the acting 
municipal mayor. He also prayed that the respondents be ordered to pay him 
P10,000 as moral damages, P1,500 as attorney's fees, and P100 as costs of 
litigation.</p>
<p>Upon denial of their motion to dismiss, appellants filed their answer 
alleging therein, <i>inter alia</i>, that the municipal council had no juridical 
personality and therefore could not be sued; that appellee had not been 
designated as acting municipal mayor and, therefore, had no right to exercise 
the rights and prerogatives of said office; that mandamus was not the proper 
remedy because appellee should have sought relief under the provisions of 
Sections 2188-2191 of the Revised Administrative Code before resorting to the 
courts.</p>
<p>After trial upon the issues thus raised, the lower court rendered the 
appealed decision, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For all the foregoing, the Court declares that.the Vice Mayor is entitled to 
assume and discharge the office of Municipal Mayor in accordance with Sec. 2195 
of the Rev. Adm. Code in the absence of the latter without having designated 
anyone to act as such; and considering that there is no other plain, speedy and 
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to which the petitioner may 
resort, the special remedy of Mandamus is in order and by the present is 
granted. The respondents Municipal Secretary, Chief of Police and the five 
members of the Municipal Council, Dr. Benito Go, Mrs. Marpa, Mr. Torrevillas, 
Mr. Molo and Mr. Badiable are hereby ordered to immediately recognize the 
authority and personality of the petitioner as acting Municipal Mayor, of the 
municipality of Carigara and to pay the costs without pronouncement as to moral 
damages and other incidental expenses alleged in the petition or in the 
counterclaim."</p></blockquote>
<p>The respondents appeal ed and now urge us to reverse the decision of the 
lower court upon the following grounds: firstly, appellee was not entitled to a 
writ of mandamus because he had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the 
ordinary course of the law to secure the relief sought in his petition; 
secondly, under the provisions of Section 2195 of the Revised Administrative 
Code appellee was not entitled to assume the office of municipal mayor of 
Carigara during the absence of mayor Aguilar on official business in Manila; and 
thirdly, the lower court erred in not awarding the moral damages, attorney's 
fees and expenses of litigation claimed in their counterclaim.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the incident involved in this case happened four years ago, the 
principal legal question involved herein could be considered as moot were it not 
for the fact that appellants claim that the lower court erred in not awarding 
them the damages sought in their counterclaim. Their right thereto depends 
principally if not entirely upon whether appellee's action was justified and, if 
it was not, whether he filed suit in bad faith.</p>
<p>It is not disputed that mayor Aguilar left Carigara for Manila on March 6, 
1957 on official business, in compliance with a duly approved resolution of the 
municipal council. While appellee contends that it was enough for the mayor to 
be away—not present physically—from Carigara for him to be entitled, to step 
into his shoes, appellants, for their part, contend that the "absence, 
suspension or other temporary disability of the mayor" mentioned in the legal 
provision relied upon by appellee refer to disability which temporarily prevents 
the municipal mayor from performing the duties of his office. Consequently, 
appellants argue, inasmuch as mayor Aguilar was in Manila <i>on official 
business</i>, he was not disabled at all but was actually performing the duties 
of his office. To allow the vice-mayor to act as acting mayor under such state 
of facts would lead to the irregular situation of two mayors for the same 
municipality acting at the same time.</p>
<p>Appellants contention seems to be logical. Section 2195 of the Revised 
Administrative Code considers "absence" on the same level as "suspension" and 
other forms of <i>temporary disability</i>—If a municipal mayor is 
<i>suspended</i>—as in the case of Laxamana <i>vs</i>. Baltazar, (92 Phil., 32; 
42 Off. Gaz., [9] 3869) relied upon by appellee obviously he is <i>disabled</i> 
temporarily; he can not act as mayor or exercise the powers and prerogatives of 
his office while under suspension. The "absence" that would authorize the 
vice-mayor to act as acting mayor should, therefore, be construed in the same 
manner; it should be such absence as <i>disables</i> the mayor from exercising 
the powers and prerogatives of his office. Such is not the case in the one 
before us because mayor Aguilar was in Manila precisely in his capacity as mayor 
of Carigara transacting official business. Although physically absent from 
Carigara, he was in the exercise of the powers and prerogatives of his office 
and was naturally entitled to continue drawing his salary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the ordinary meaning of "absence" is the state of being 
away or not present, we believe that an officer's absence is not such as to 
warrant the placing of another person temporarily in his place unless said 
officer is absent on an occasion demanding the immediate exercise of the powers 
of his office. In the case before us there is no satisfactory evidence showing 
that, during the absence of mayor Aguilar on official business in Manila, 
particularly at the time appellee attempted to assume the office of acting mayor 
of Carigara, an occasion had arisen demanding immediate and peremptory exercise 
of the powers of that office either for the preservation of public order or for 
the enforcement of the laws and ordinances. We, therefore, agree with appellants 
that under the circumstances of the case, appellee had no right to assume the 
office of acting mayor.</p>
<p>This question has already been decided by the Executive Branch of the 
government. On November 25, 1948 the then Secretary of the Interior rendered an 
opinion upon a case on all fours with the present, the pertinent portions of 
which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The phrase 'other temporary disability' found in section 2195 of the Code, 
follows the words 'absence' and 'suspension' and is used as a modifier of the 
two preceding words, under the principle of statutory construction known as 
<i>ejusdem generis</i>.</p>
<p>"Under American jurisprudence, 'absence' is construed to mean not merely 
physical absence, but absence which prevents the mayor from the active 
performance of his duties.</p>
<p>"'In the case of the mayor of a municipality, it is usually provided that the 
president of the municipal council shall exercise all the powers of the mayor 
during his absence from the municipality, and under such a provision it has been 
held that 'absence' must be construed reasonably, and so construed means what 
may be called 'effective' absence. (37 American Jurisprudence, 893.' In the case 
of Gelinas <i>vs</i>. Fugere (R.I.) 180 A. 346, 351, 'effective' absence was 
given the same interpretation.</p>
<p>"In the instant case, however, Mayor Carlos E. Perez left his office for 
Manila, for the purpose of transacting official business affecting his 
municipality * * *. Under this circumstance, his absence can not be called 
'effective' to warrant the assumption by the vice-mayor of his position by 
operation of law, as to all intents Mayor Perez continues in the exercise of his 
power and prerogatives even while outside the municipality and draws his salary 
for the period he was out of his official station." (Decision Secretary of 
Interior, dated November 25, 1948, pp. 54-55, The Provincial and Municipal Law, 
by Cortes)</p></blockquote>
<p>While the above opinion is not necessarily controlling upon the courts, it 
must be accorded considerable weight giving as it does1the interpretation of the 
Executive Department of a legal provision affecting the rights of subordinate 
officials.</p>
<p>The above notwithstanding, we find appellants' claim for damages to be 
without merit because there is no evidence of any kind showing that appellee had 
acted maliciously and in bad faith in bringing this suit for mandamus, nor is 
there sufficient evidence in the record to prove the damages claimed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed insofar as it grants the 
writ of mandamus, and is affirmed insofar as it dismisses the counterclaim of 
appellants. Without costs.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
