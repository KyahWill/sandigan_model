				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 10, 1956, defendant Wang Wan Tat executed a promissory note of 
the following tenor:—
<blockquote>
<p>"Twelve (12) months after date, I promise to pay for value received, the 
INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CO., INC. or order the sum of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS 
(P5,000.00), on four (4) equal installments payable every end of the quarter of 
P1,250.00 a quarter.</p>
<p>With 6% interest and attorney's fee if this note is not paid upon maturity, 
The maker and indorsers severally waived presentment for payment, protest, 
notice of protest and notice of non-payment of this note."</p></blockquote>
<p>To secure the above note, defendant Wang Wan Tat as principal and his 
co-defendant Pek Hock Leng as Surety, executed in favor of plaintiff 
International Tobacco Co., Inc., a Surety Bond, the pertinent portions of which 
are quoted below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREAS, the above bonded Principal, on the 10th day of December, 1956, 
executed a Promissory Note in favor of the INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CO., INC., in 
the amount of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00) payable on four (4) equal 
installments for a period of twelve (12) months commencing on December 10, 1956. 
* * *</p>
<p>The undersigned Surety in this Surety Bond are also subject to the following 
conditions and obligations:</p>
<blockquote><p>"(a) That in the event that the Principal fails to pay his obligation, as 
stipulated in the said Promissory Note,the undersigned shall upon demand 
immediately pay the INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CO., INC., the full amount of 
Promissory Note to the INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CO., INC., for the failure of the 
said Principal to comply with his obligation under the said Promissory 
Note."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>On June 28, 1957, due to the failure of defendant Wang Wan Tat to pay any of 
the stipulated installments, and after repeated demands on both Wang Wan Tat and 
Pek Hock Leng, were unheeded, a complaint for the collection of the amount 
including the interest and attorney's fees, was instituted with the Court of 
First Instance of Manila.</p>
<p>On July 10, 1957, the defendants, instead of Answering the Complaint, 
presented a Motion to Dismiss, claiming that the promissory note was not yet due 
and demandable and, therefore, the action was premature. Over the opposition of 
plaintiff, contending that the complaint states sufficient cause of action upon 
the Promissory Note and the Surety Bond, the lower court issued an order of the 
following nature:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a motion to dismiss plaintiff's action filed by the defendants on 
the ground that it states no cause of action.</p>
<p>It appears that the complaint seeks the payment of a promissory note executed 
on December 10, 1956, by the defendant Wang Wan Tat, in favor of the plaintiff, 
International Tobacco Co., which note is attached to the complaint as Annex 'A'. 
But the note itself specifically provides that the same shall be paid twelve 
months after date, which is December 10, 1957, and it is very apparent that said 
note has not yet matured because the twelve months had not yet expired. It is 
then very clear that the presentation of the complaint is premature and, 
consequently, plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the complaint is hereby dismissed without costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>After the motion for reconsideration was denied allegedly for lack of merits, 
the matter was brought before Us for review.</p>
<p>We find the lower court in error, in dismissing the complaint on the supposed 
ground of lack of cause of action. It is true that the action was brought before 
the expiration of the twelve months period, and that the terms of the promissory 
note might convey the notion entertained or interpretation made by the lower 
court thereof. Considering, however, the fact that the surety bond, Annex B, 
executed by the defendants which forms part and parcel of the complaint, 
provides that the sum of P5,000.00 is "payable on four (4) equal installments 
<i>for a period of twelve</i> (12) <i>months commencing on December 10, 
1956,"</i> there can no longer be any doubt that failure to pay any of the 
installments on the respective quarter, within the year, commencing from 
December 10, 1956, the date of the promissory note, constitutes already a breach 
and a cause of action arises. And if we consider further the condition of the 
surety bond, it becomes manifest that since there was failure on the part of the 
principal, to pay the obligation, as stipulated, the whole amount became 
immediately demandable, against the defendant surety Pek Hock Leng. Factually, 
when the complaint was filed, not a single quarterly installment was paid within 
the year.</p>
<p>Pending decision, the defendants-appellees submitted a motion to dismiss the 
appeal, enclosing therewith a photostatic copy often alleged promissory note, 
dated December 10, 1957, in which Pek Hock Leng (surety) undertook to pay the 
P5,000 in monthly installments of P100.00, providing that failure on his part to 
pay one of the installments will render the whole balance immediately demandable 
and stating that this promissory note supersedes the note signed by Wang Wan 
Tat, dated December 10, 1956, object of the present case. The new promissory note 
bore the supposed acceptance of Francisco Cokeng, General Manager of the 
plaintiff-appellant. It is alleged that the second promissory note has caused a 
novation of the pre-existing contract sued upon. In view, however, of the 
conclusions reached by Us in the case and there being no showing that the 
photostatic copy is derived from an authentic original note, and there being no 
conformity of the plaintiff-appellant to the dismissal of its appeal, the motion 
to dismiss the appeal is hereby denied, without prejudice of presenting it at 
the opportune time and in the proper place.</p>
<p>Finding that the order appealed from is not in conformity with the facts and 
the law on the matter, the same should be, as it is hereby set aside, and 
another entered remanding the case to the court of origin for further 
proceedings.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
