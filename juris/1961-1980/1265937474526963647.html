<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Commissioner of Immigration, 
represented by the Solicitor General, seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the 
Court of First Instance of Manila to give due course to his appeal, in Civil 
Case No. 51433 of said court, annulling the orders setting aside the approval of 
the appeal, and for a writ of injunction to restrain execution of the appealed 
decision. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The pertinent facts of record are 
that on March 30,1963 respondent Judge Francisco Area, of Branch I of the Court 
of First Instance of Manila, rendered a decision, in Civil Case No. 51433, 
ordering the issuance of a writ of prohibition enjoining the Commissioner of 
Immigration from arresting, confining, and deporting a Chinese woman, Lee O 
<span class="SpellE">Koo</span> <i>alias</i> Dee O <span class="SpellE">Koo</span>, 
and her son, Lim Chen Pen alias Chen Pen; to refund the immigration bond for 
their temporary stay; and declaring both to be Filipino citizens. Copy of this 
decision was served on the Solicitor General on </span><st1:date month="4" day="2" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 
2, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On April 17 of that year, the 
Solicitor General moved for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>, but this 
motion was denied on </span><st1:date month="5" day="18" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 18, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the vacation Judge, Hon. Tito V. <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span>. Copy of the 
denial was received by counsel for the Commissioner on </span><st1:date month="5" day="22" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 22, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On May 24, 1963, the Solicitor 
General filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court; and in view thereof, 
vacation Judge <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span>, by order of May 28, 1963, 
ordered that the records be elevated to this Court in accord with Section 17 of 
Rule 41.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 4, 1963, counsel for the 
Chinese asked for the reconsideration of the preceding order; and on June 23 
respondent Judge Area reconsidered and set aside the order of transmittal of the 
case record on the ground that his decision of March 30, 1963 had already become 
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, since, after discounting the 
period during which the motion for reconsideration was pending, more than 
fifteen days had elapsed from the notice ox said decision to the filing of the 
Commissioner's Notice of Appeal. His motion for reconsideration having been 
denied, the Immigration Commissioner resorted to this Court. We issued a writ of 
preliminary injunction to hold the execution in abeyance until the case could be 
decided on its merits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The sole issue in this case is 
whether the decision of the court below, dated </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 
30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
and served on the Solicitor General on </span><st1:date month="4" day="2" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 2, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, had 
been appealed on time or had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 17 of Rule 41 of the 
Rules of Court in force in 1963 requires that appeals in prohibition cases be 
perfected within 15 days. Petitioning Commissioner does not deny that, 
discounting the period during which Judge <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span> held 
his motion for reconsideration under advisement, his notice of appeal was filed 
on the sixteenth (16th) day after notice of the questioned judgment, the 
operative period for appeal being from April 2 to April 17, 1963 (14 days) and 
from May 22 to May 21 1963 (2 days). Petitioner contends, however, that Judge 
<span class="SpellE">Tizon</span>, by his order of </span><st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 
28, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
directing the Clerk to forward the records of the case to this Court, impliedly 
extended the period for the appeal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We think this position is not 
tenable, since no extension of the appeal period was ever asked by the Solicitor 
General of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span>. No objection was made at the 
time that the appeal was belated, and it is clear on the face of the record that 
Judge <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span> merely took for granted that the appeal 
notice was timely. It is true that the Solicitor General filed an affidavit of 
his clerk, dated June 11, 1963, purporting to show that the delay in filing the 
notice was due to excusable negligence (Annex A to Annex 1); but the affidavit 
was executed on June 11, almost 20 days after the expiration of the appeal 
period (on May 23), and was in fact submitted to Judge Area, who correctly 
refused to consider it since the judgment had become final, and he no longer had 
any discretion in the matter (<span class="SpellE">Tiongko</span> vs. Area, 102 
Phil. 173, and cases therein cited; Rodriguez vs. Fernandez, 51 Off <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. 1802-1801; <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Sec. of Agriculture, 104 Phil. 
151). It is well-established that extensions of time must be asked before 
expiration of the original period sought to be extended (Alejandro <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span>, 
64 Phil. 321, 325; <span class="SpellE">Singbengco</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Arellano, (99 Phil. 952; 52 Off. 
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">. 6167; 
Buena <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span>, 54 Off.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 2184).</span> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is also argued that there 
having been already an order to forward the records to the appellate court, the 
Court of First Instance no longer had jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal. This 
is not correct, since section 11 of Rule 11 expressly authorizes a motion to 
dismiss an appeal in the trial court prior to the transmittal of the record to 
the appellate court; and the best evidence that the records in this case have 
not yet been so transmitted, despite the lapse of the ten days fixed by section 
11, Rule 41, is that the petitioner is now still asking this Court to compel 
respondent Judge to elevate the records. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the writs of certiorari and 
mandamus prayed for are hereby denied; and the preliminary injunction heretofore 
issued is dissolved. No costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
