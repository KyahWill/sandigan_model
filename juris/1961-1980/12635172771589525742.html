<p class="BODY">As the abovementioned decision became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the corresponding writ of execution was issued,
and pursuant to it the Sheriff of Manila levied on certain personal properties
of the judgment debtor which, upon sale at public auction, netted only the
amount of P1<span class="GramE">,031.55</span>, with which the judgment was
partially satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 15, 1960 an alias writ of execution was issued, pursuant
to which the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, on March 16,
1960, attached end levied - the attachment and notice of levy having been
registered on the same date - all the rights, title, interest and participation
of the judgment debtor, <span class="SpellE">Jus­tiniano</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>, in a parcel of land and its improvements situated
in San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City,
and more particularly described in and covered by T.C.T. No. 236-A by the Re­gister
of Deeds of said City in the name of <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date the only encumbrance duly
annotated on the aforesaid certificate of title was a mortgage in favor of the
Bank exe­cuted by <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
and his wife, to secure the payment of the sum of P13<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the required notice of sale was
duly published, setting the sale at public auction of the property levied upon
on <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1960</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning in the City Hall

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1960</st1:date>
the Bank filed a third party claim, stating therein that it was the <u>mortgagee</u>
of the property described in the notice of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding - and presumably because
the required indemnity bond was filed by the judgment creditor - the execution
sale was made as scheduled on April 8, 1960 at eight o'clock in the morning,
the property having been sold to the highest bidder - the judgment creditor -
who assumed the mortgage with which the property was burdened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of sale dated <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1960</st1:date> (Exhibit H) was duly

<p class="BODY">Desiring to pay the mortgage obligation already mentioned, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> requested the Bank to inform him about the exact

do so claiming at that time that it already owned the property having purchased
it in an extra-judicial foreclosure sale.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">In the meantime the one year period of redemption speci­fied in
the certificate of sale (Exhibit H) of April 8, 1960 expired without any party

City executed the corresponding deed of final sale (Exhibit M-3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 27 of the same year the trial court,
upon <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion, directed the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City to deliver to him the possession of the

he filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Branch) "A Petition for Entry of New
Certificate of Title <span class="GramE">Under</span> Section 78, Act
496".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing with
previous notice served upon the Register of Deeds of said city, the Court
issued on May 9, 1961 an order directing the latter to cancel T.C.T. No. 236-A
and to issue in lieu thereof another certificate in the name of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
said officer refused to comply with said order unless the owner's duplicate of

his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>
request for the delivery of said owner's duplicate made upon the Bank was,

thereof as a result of an extra-judicial foreclosure sale; that the property
not having been redeemed within the time provided by law, the Bank became its
absolute owner upon the expiration of said period on December 17, 1959; that in
view of all these facts and circumstances, the levy and the sale at public
auction of the property covered by T.C.T. No. 236-A were of no legal force and
effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last two assignments of error would stand or fall according
to whether the Bank's main contention is sustained or overruled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the undisputed facts set forth above, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are of the opinion, and so hold, that the Bank's main contention is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its case would indeed be
unassailable had the sale in its favor made on December 17, 1958 as a result of
the extra-judicial foreclosure of the real estate mortgage executed by the <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> spouses, been registered <u>before March 16, 1960</u>
- the date when the same mortgaged property was attached and levied upon and
subsequently (April 8, 1960) sold at public auction by virtue by the alias writ
of execution issued in Civil Case No. 35447.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This levy in execution was duly registered on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="3"><u>March 16, 1960</u></st1:date>, while the certificate of
sheriff's sale (Exhibit H) in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
executed on <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1960</st1:date>
was registered on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="4"><u>April 12, 1960</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, it is an admitted fact
that the extra-judicial foreclosure sale made in favor of the Bank on December
17, 1958 <u>was registered the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City only on April 21, 1960</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled in this jurisdiction that a sale of real estate,
whether made as a result of a private transaction or of a foreclosure or
execution sale, becomes legally effective against third parties only from the
date of its registration (Section 50, Pct 496; Anderson &amp; Co., vs. Garcia
64:506) which, in the case of the foreclosure sale in favor of the Bank, as
stated heretofore, was ef­fected only an <u>April 21, 1960</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, when the same property subject
matter thereof was actually attached and levied upon on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="3"><u>March 16, 1960</u></st1:date> and the levy thus made was
registered on the same date, the property stood in the official records of the
government still as property of <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and was therefore properly at­tached, levied upon
and subsequently sold as his property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The net result of this is that the execution sale made in favor of
herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> transferred to him all the rights,
interest and participation of <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> in the
aforesaid property at that time, subject only to the lone encumbrance duly
registered and annotated on the back of Certificate of Title No. 236-A issued
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> (Ramirez vs. <span class="SpellE">Causin</span>, G. R. L-10794, July 31, 1957; Capistrano vs.
Philippine National Bank et al., G. R. L-­9628, August 30, 1957; Vargas vs. <span class="SpellE">Tancioco</span> 67:308; Philippine Executive Commission vs. <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span> 74:68).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the conclusion <span class="GramE">We</span> have
arrived at in con­nection with the first six assignments of error, a dis­cussion
of the remaining two is no longer deemed necessary.</p>
