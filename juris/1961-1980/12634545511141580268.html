appeal fro</span><span style="">m </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">decision of </span><span style="">the Court of </span>First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte dismissing the complaint, without costs.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 7, 1960, the
plaintiffs, numbering 24 in all, surnamed <span class="SpellE">Manarpaac</span>,
filed this action against <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span>, the Director of Lands and the Register of Deeds
of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, on
a complaint which as amended on December 22, 1960, alleges that the plaintiffs
have been, since time </span><span style="">immemorial,
in </span><span style="">actual pos­session as owners
of two parcels of land, the first, with an area of 8,742 sq. m. and assessed at
P160.00 under tax declaration No. 034206, in the name of <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manarpaac</span>, the second, with </span>an area <span style="">of 12211 sq. </span>m. <span style="">and assessed at P3</span>9<span style="">0.00 under tax de­</span>claration No.
030876, both parcels are situated at Barrio 15, <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, specifically described in paragraph
"2" of the complaint; that such posses­sion has been public,
uninterrupted and in the <span style="">concept </span>of
owner; that they <span style="">have </span>their
houses built on the land; that in the year 1956, the defendant <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span> filed an
application for free patent of a parcel of agricultural public land situated at
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Suyo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, with an area of 27,788 sq. <span style="">m., and said defendant "taking advantage
of the ig­</span>norance and lack of education of the plaintiffs, <span class="SpellE">wil­<span style="">fully</span></span><span style="">, fraudulently, maliciously, and </span>surreptitiously
<span style="">without previous notice </span>to the
plaintiffs whatsoever, <span style="">included the
above described parcels of land" (par. </span>"2" of the
complaint) in his application for free pa­tent; that on November 7, 1959, a
free patent was is­sued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span> by the Director of Lands, and on December 3,
1959, certificate of <span style="">title No. V-105031 was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span> by the register of deeds; that said
certifi­cate of title which included the land of the plaintiffs, is null and
void, because the patent was obtained thru <span style="">"fraudulent </span>misrepresentation"; and that <span style="">the </span>proceed­ings leading to the
investigation and survey of the land were without notice <span style="">and without compliance with </span>the
requirements of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs,
therefore, prayed that the free patent and the certificate of title be <span style="">declared null </span>and void, and the same
should be cancelled; "4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in
case the title issued may <span style="">not be
annulled, that the defendant <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span> </span>be ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
unto the plaintiffs their lands unlawfully and fraudulently included in said
title"; that the defendant be <span style="">ordered
to pay </span>attorney's fees in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;
and "6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiffs pray
for such further relief and remedy <span style="">as
may be </span>deemed just and equitable in the premises."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defendants filed
separate answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his answer dated
February 8, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span>
denied </span><span style="">the material allegations
in the com­</span><span style="">plaint, and, as
special defense alleged: (a) that the issuance of the free patent </span><span style="">and certificate of title </span><span style="">in his name were regular and after </span><span style="">compliance with </span><span style="">the requirements of the </span><span style="">law; (b) that </span><span style="">the plaintiffs </span>never protested with the Director of Lands
against the defendant's application for free patent; they did not appeal from
the decision of the Director of Lands awarding the land to said defendants; and
the plain­tiffs have failed to exhaust the administrative reme­dies required by
law, and, therefore, the decision of the Director of Lands has<span style=""> </span>become final; (c) that the original
complaint was for nullity of title, however, the amended complaint <span style="">is </span>for
RECONVEYANCE which <span style="">is </span>le­gally impermissible, for it changed the cause of action,
and hence, the amended complaint should have been <span style="">dis­missed, </span>and the plaintiffs
required to file <span style="">a </span>new com­plaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer dated <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="1">January
 6, 1961</st1:date>, the Direct­or of Lands alleged that the issuance of the
free patent was regular and after compliance with the require­ments of the law;
that "2. <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><u>he admits the alle</u><u><span style="">gation in paragraph 6 of the complaint to the
</span>effect that one year from the issuance of patent has not yet elapsed</u>";
and that the plaintiffs never filed any pro­test with the Bureau of Lands
against the application for free patent filed by <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
Register of Deeds in his answer dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="1"><span style="">January
 </span>11, 1961</st1:date>, <span style="">alleged
that </span><span style="">the
issuance </span>of the certificate of title in the name of <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span> was in pur­suance of a decree of <span style="">patent </span><span style="">presented to </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">office, </span><span style="">and that he merely acted in compliance of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
September 22, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span>
filed a motion </span><span style="">to dismiss on the
following </span><span style="">ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That even </span><span style="">assuming that plaintiffs have a right over
the land in suit, their </span><span style="">action has already prescribed and </span><span style="">that the </span>court, therefore, has no
jurisdiction", predicating the contention on the rulings that "When
any <span style="">public </span>lands are alienated,
the same shall be brought forthwith un­der the operation of Section 22 of the
Land Registra­<span style="">tion Act and shall become
registered land x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">certificate of title
shall be issued </span><span style="">as in other </span><span style="">cases </span>of
registered land (<span class="SpellE">Diwaling</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumail</span>,
et al. v. CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, L-8287, April 20, 1955),
and "the one year period under Section 38 of Act 496 should, in the case
of <span style="">public
land </span><span style="">grants (patent), be counted
from the issuance of the patent by the Government under the Public Land Act (<span class="SpellE">Nelayan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Nelayan</span>, 109 Phil. 183</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The plaintiffs opposed
the <span style="">motion to dismiss.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 23, 1963, the court issued an order dismissing the
complaint holding that the free patent having been issued on November 3, 1959,
and the first complaint was filed on December 7, 1960, the action for review of
the decree was, therefore, filed more than one year after the issuance of the
patent.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this order, the plaintiffs appealed directly to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the averment of facts in the complaint, it clearly appears
that the plaintiffs have been, <u>since time immemorial, in possession as
owners of the dis­puted </u><u><span style="">land, have declared the land for tax purposes </span><span style="">the names of two of them and have built </span></u><u><span style="">their houses on the land</span></u><span style="">, but that through fraud and irregularity, de­fendant
<span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span>
succeeded in <span class="GramE">securing</span> for himself, the certificate of
title in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing <span class="GramE">recital of facts in the complaint are</span> sufficient averment of
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Possession since time <span class="GramE">immemorial,</span> carries the presumption that the land had never
been part of the public domain, or, that it had been a private property even
before the Spanish con­quest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, we
said in one case –<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="GramE">All</span> lands that were
not acquired from the Government, either by purchase or grant, be­long to the
public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An exception to the rule
would be any land that should have been in the possession of an occupant and of
his predecessors in interest since time immemorial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FOR SUCH POSSESSION WOULD JUSTIFY THE PRE­SUMPTION
THAT THE LAND HAVE NEVER BEEN PART OF THE PUBLIC DOMAIN OR THAT IT HAD BEEN A
PRIVATE PROPER<span style="">TY EVEN BEFORE THE
SPANISH CON­QUEST." (Oh <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> v. Director of
Lands, </span><span style="">75 Phil. 890, citing <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> v. Insular Government, 212 U.S. 449, 53 L. Ed. 394.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Whether
this presumption should hold as </span><span style="">a fact </span><span style="">or
not, is a question appropriately determinable only after the parties have
adduced, or at least, are given the </span><span style="">opportunity to adduce, their respective
evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
ruling in <span class="SpellE">Susi</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> and
Director of Lands, 48 Phil. 414 [re-affirmed in <span class="SpellE">Mesin</span>
v. Pineda, 108 Phil. 251] sustained on all fours the validity of plaintiffs'
theory, thus -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In favor of <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Susi</span>, there is, moreover, the presumption <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">juris</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>et</u> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE">j<u>u</u><u><span style="">re</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>establish­ed in paragraph (b) of
section 45 of Act No. 2874, amending Act No. 926, that all the necessary
requirements for a grant by the Government were complied with, for he has been
in actual and physical possession, personally and through his predecessors, of
an agricultural land of the pub­lic domain openly, continuously, exclusively
and publicly since July 26, 1894, with <span style="">a </span>right to <span style="">a certificate </span>of title to said land
under the provisions of Chapter VIII of said Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that when Angela <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
applied for the grant in her favor, <span class="SpellE">Va­lentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Susi</span> had already acquired by operation of law, not only <span style="">a </span>right to
a grant, but a grant of the Government, for it <span style="">is </span>not necessary that certificate of
title should be issued in order that said grant may be sanctioned by the
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If by legal fiction, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Susi</span> had acquired the
land in question by <span style="">a </span>grant of the state, it had already ceased to be of the public
domain and had become private property, at least by presumption, of <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Susi</span>, beyond the control
of the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
in selling the land in question to Angela <span class="SpellE">Ra­zon</span>, the
Director of Lands disposed of a land over which he had no lon­ger any title or
control and the sale thus made was void and of no effect, and Angela <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> did not thereby acquire any right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Director of Lands con­tends that the land in question
being of the public domain, the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
cannot main­tain an action to recover poss­ession thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If, as above stated, that land, the possession of which is in
dispute, had already become, by operation of law, private pro­perty, there is
lacking only the judicial sanction of his title, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Susi</span> has the right to bring an action to recover the
possession thereof and hold it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
the case at bar, predicated upon the allega­tions in the complaint, together
with the admission of defendant <span class="SpellE">Cabanatan</span> in his
answer - that the amended complaint is an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>,
which are deemed admitted on a motion to </span><span style="">dismiss, </span><span style="">there can hardly be
any debate that the complaint states a sufficient cause of action for recovery
of possession of the land, for, settled is the rule that the remedy of the land­owner
whose property has been wrongfully or erroneously registered </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">another's name is,
after one year from the date of the </span><span style="">decree, </span><span style="">not to set aside
the decree, but respecting the </span><span style="">decree </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">incontrovertible
and no longer open to review, to bring an ordinary action in the ordinary court
of justice for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> or, if the property has
passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser for value, for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>
</span><span style="">v. <span class="SpellE">Espartero</span>, 95 Phil. 799.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the order of dismissal appealed from is hereby set aside, and the case
is ordered remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs in this appeal
