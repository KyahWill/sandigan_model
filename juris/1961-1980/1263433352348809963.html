				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review by certiorari, but treated by this
Court as a special civil action in a resolution dated February 14, 1977 (p.
157, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), instituted by petitioner, Southwestern
University, herein referred to as SU, to review the decision of the City Court
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in Civil Case No. 9965 as affirmed <span class="GramE">by</span> the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City on a petition for certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1963</st1:date>,
SU an educational institution located in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
filed separate actions for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against Jose <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span> (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-9965) and
Julia <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> (Civil Case No. 9981) with the City Court
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>SU alleged that it had acquired by purchase (conditional sale) three
parcels of land located at <st1:street><st1:address>Jones Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
from the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and more particularly described in <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> Nos. 16951,
16952, <span class="GramE">16953</span> sometime in July 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sought to eject the defendant <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span> from the 84 square meters lot which forms part of
the three parcels of land on which the defendant built a house, when the latter
failed to pay the P20.00 monthly rental despite repeated demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant alleged, on the other hand, that
the monthly rental of P20.00 is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
agreement between the Philip­pine Railway Company which is the original owner
of the land in question, the original agreed rental having been only P5.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1969</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which insofar as <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span> is concerned is

both parties, with the approval of the court." (pp. 60-61, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the City Court's decision, SU filed an appeal with the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City on <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="8">August
 21, 1971</st1:date>, petitioner made an alleged consignation of the P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, after the appeal was pending for more than three (3) years, it
withdrew the appeal on <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1973</st1:date>
on the ground that it is no longer interested in pursuing the appeal, having
been convinced of the fairness and reasonable­ness of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1973</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion for the execution of the judgment dated <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1969</st1:date> with the City Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court denied said motion in an order made
on <st1:date year="1973" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1973</st1:date>
disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore in view of the foregoing, the Court believes and so
holds that the decision of this Court dated June 18, 1969 as against defendant,
Jose <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span> has already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on July 24, 1969 and since plaintiff has failed
to comply with the decision of this Court, particularly paragraph 5 thereof,
plaintiff's Motion for Execution of Judgment is hereby denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However in the interest of justice and
equity, the defendant in the exercise of the right granted him in the decision
of this Court is hereby ordered to pay to the plaintiff the value of 84 square
meters which is occupied <span style="">by<i> </i></span>him
in the amount of P8<span class="GramE">,400.00</span> from the Office of the City
Treasurer at the rate of P100.00 per square meter which according to the City
Assessor was the prevailing assessed value of the land in 1969." <span class="GramE">(p. 70, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">SU filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Court denied it in an order dated
February 28, 1974 for lack of merit and ordered the plaintiff to withdraw the
amount of P8<span class="GramE">,400.00</span> from the office of the City
Treasurer and further required him to execute a Deed of Sale in favor of the
defendant for the 84 square meters of land located at <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(p. 88, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the above orders of the City Court, SU filed a petition for
certiorari with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Branch XIV whereby the actuations of the respondent judge were assailed for
lack, or being in excess, of jurisdiction and tainted with grave abuse of
discretion in issuing the above orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision dated <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1975</st1:date>, the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> dismissed the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 87, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Motion for Reconsideration was filed by petitioner-plaintiff but was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus petitioner filed the instant
petition for review on certiorari with this Court, but treated as a special
civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 157,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Memorandum petitioner raised the following issues,
corresponding to the errors assigned:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->WHETHER OR NOT <span class="SpellE">BALIGUAT</span>
IS A BUILDER IN GOOD FAITH TO JUSTIFY THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 448 OF THE
CIVIL CODE, AND WHETHER THIS PROVISION GRANTS THE BUILDER IN GOOD FAITH THE
RIGHT TO BUY THE LAND.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->WHETHER OR NOT THE PAYMENT OF INDEMNITY OF P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> WAS WELL WITHIN THE 90 DAY PERIOD FROM THE TIME THE
JUDGMENT HAS BECOME FINAL AND <span class="SpellE">EXECUTORY</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->WHETHER OR NOT IT IS WITHIN THE JURIS­DICTION OF
THE TRIAL COURT TO GO OUTSIDE THE TENOR OF THE JUDGMENT THAT ORDERED THE
PURCHASE PRICE TO BE AS AGREED UPON BY BOTH PARTIES, AND DECREE THAT PETI­TIONER
ACCEPT RESPONDENT'S P8<span class="GramE">,400.00</span> AS THE PRICE OF THE LAND
AT THE RATE OF P100.00 PER SQUARE METERS AS FIXED BY THE OFFICE OF THE CITY
ASSESSOR BASED ON THE PREVAILING ASSESSED VALUE OF THE LAND IN QUESTION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Petitioner's Memorandum, pp. 172-173, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner questions the finding of the City Court and the
Court of First Instance that respondent was a builder in good faith, by relying
on the fact that as a lessee, he cannot be considered a builder in good faith
and therefore Article 448 of the Civil Code does not apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such finding of the lower courts can no
longer be disturbed at this stage because the petitioner's act of withdrawing
his appeal is tantamount to his <span class="SpellE">acquiescense</span> and
acceptance of the decision, as petitioner him­self said in his motion to
dismiss that "he is no longer interested <span style="">in pursuing the appeal </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>having been convinced of the fairness and
reasonableness of the judgment of the lower court</u>." <span class="GramE">(p.
137, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where an appellant withdraws his appeal, he must face the consequence of
his withdrawal, such as the deci­sion of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> becoming
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Director of Lands vs. Alberto, L-28516, July 31,
1973, 52 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 186).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the withdrawal of the appeal from
the decision of the City Court holding that the defendant was a builder in good
faith and should be indemnified for P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> for the
improvements made, and that failure to pay such indemnity shall give the
defendant the right to buy the land at a price agreed upon by both parties and
with the approval of the court, renders said decision final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as well as conclusive and <span class="SpellE">estops</span>
the petitioner from questioning anew said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue to be resolved is when the judgment of the City
Court became final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Court in
its order dated December 20, 1973 relying strongly upon the cases of Singh vs.
Liberty Insurance Corporation (L-16860, July 31, 1963, 8 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
517) and Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tempongko</span>
(L-24399, March 28, 1969, 27 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 418) held that
since <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span> did not interpose any appeal from the
decision of this Court, dated June 18, 1969, said decision has long become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as to <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span>
after the lapse of 15 days from June 18, 1969 and more specifically on July 24,
1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends that the
judgment of this Court has become final only upon the withdrawal of the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of this issue, this Court is of the belief
that it would be absurd to accept the view that the judg­ment pending appeal
has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as to res­pondent, <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span>, and not final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
as to the petitio­ner, because the result of the appeal proceedings is
determina­tive of the respective rights of the litigants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling relied upon by the City Court in
the cases of Singh vs. Liberty Insu­rance Corporation and Firestone Tire and
Rubber Co. of the Phil. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tempongko</span> which states
that "xxx as against other parties adversely affected by the decision who
did not appeal, the decision must be deemed to have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as to him", finds no application in the case
at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cited cases dealt with
collection actions to recover certain sum of money where the plaintiffs
obtained judgment in the municipal <span style="">court
against defendants who in turn obtained judgment for reimbursement against the
3rd party defendants, but only the latter appealed to the CFI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in the case at bar the
defendant also did not appeal from the questioned decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in the Singh and Fires</span>tone
cases, <span style="">notwithstanding the appeal of
the 3rd party defendants the decision insofar as the plaintiff and defendant
were concerned, there was no hindrance to the execution of the judg­ment which
could stand despite the appeal made by the 3rd party defendant from whom the
defendant can seek contribution, indemnity or subrogation or any other relief
(Rule 6, Sec. 12 Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rights and claim of the plaintiff against defendant remain unaffected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case however, it is the
plaintiff who appealed from the City Court's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending the appeal, with trial de novo, the
decision was vacated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But </span>as <span style="">to the plaintiffs and defendants in the Singh
and Fire­stone cases, the judgment is final since neither is disputing the said
judgment notwithstanding the appeal instituted by the 3rd party defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our ruling on the matter
is in accordance with Rule 40 Section 9 of the Rules of Court which is
applicable in the case at bar since the appeal was made on July 14, 1969, that is,
before the passage of RA 6031 on August 1969 (New Japan Motors Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Perucho</span>, L-44387, November 5, 1976, 74 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
Rule which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"xxx If the appeal is withdrawn or dis­missed for failure to
prosecute, the judgment shall be deemed revived and shall forthwith be remanded
to the municipal or City Court for execution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">clearly</span></span><span style=""> shows
that what makes the decision <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, when same is
appealed, is its withdrawal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, the
appeal filed by the petitioner before the CFI was withdrawn on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February
 1, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CFI gave due course to the withdrawal on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="3"><span style="">March
 30, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">records of the remanded
case was</span> received by the City Court on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="8"><span style="">August 14, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the appeal was withdrawn by the petitioner, the case has been revived
and shall be remanded to the municipal court for execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In many cases (<span class="SpellE">Saulog</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Custombuilt</span> Manu­facturing Corporation, et al.,
L-29612, Nov. 15, 1968, 26 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 1; International
Harvester Macleod Inc. vs. Co Ban Ling and Sons Co., et al., L-26863, October
26, 1968, 25 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 612 and the early cases of Tomas
Fortuna vs. <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> <span class="SpellE">Villoria</span>,
No. 4526, October 24, 1909, 14 Phil. 232; Mateo <span class="SpellE">Capunu</span>
</span>vs. <span style="">Julio <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span>
No. 9990, February 1, 1915, 29 Phil. 3921; Smith vs. <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span>,
et al., 57 <span class="SpellE">OG</span> 757) this Court has consistently
enunciated the uniform ruling that in cases of withdrawn or dismissed appeal,
the judg­ment shall be revived and shall be remanded to the municipal court for
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only after the remand
of the judgment that execution will lie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It follows, then, that the judgment is revived as of the time of the
withdrawal of the appeal, and is to be executed upon its remand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view is the most logical interpretation
of Rule 40, Sec. 9 because where the appeal is not <span class="GramE">withdrawn,</span>
the appeal must have to be decided upon sometime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is only from the time of the rendition
of the judgment of the appellate court that the time for the judgment's </span>finality
shall be reckoned with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the appeal filed by the petitioner gave the
respondent the time to remain in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a way, this incident worked to his benefit for his having stayed in
the pre­mises longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equity dictates
that petitioner be not punished for the appeal he had taken but later
withdrawn.</p>

<p class="BODY">The consignation cannot be attacked on ground of lack of notice
to the defendant because, if execution has to be made from the time the case is
remanded to the court of origin, notice of the consignation must have come to
the knowledge of private respondent when SU moved for execution on Oct. 9,
1973, fol­lowing the receipt of the remanded case by said court on Aug. 14,
1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less than 90 days expired from the
date of receipt of the remanded case by the court of origin to the date of the
motion for execution filed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the require­ment of notice to make the consignation effective
as provided in Art. 1257 of the Civil Code applies only in consignation as
contemplated by Art. <span class="GramE">1256 of said Code which presupposes a
refused tender of payment.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deposit of the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> with the Court was not
actually preceded by a tender of pay­ment that was refused, for the obligation
to pay the amount to the defendant <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span> was
imposed by the Court not by contract, and <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span>
could not have refused the tender of payment made in compliance with the order
of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the timely payment of the indemnity of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span> has lost the right to buy the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge, therefore,
committed a grave error when he gave the defendant the right to buy the land
for P8,400.00, the price as assessed by the Assessor's Office, not only because
its judgment provides that "should the payment of the indemnity be not
made within the 90 day period, the buyer shall have the right to buy the land
for a price agreed upon by the parties and approved by the court", but
also because the price was fixed by the Assessor's Office, and not "for a
price agreed upon by the parties and approved by the court", as so
directed in the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations made by the respondent, <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span>,
in a memorandum submitted to this court, that at the time the action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> was filed, petitioner SU is not yet the owner of
the parcels of land in question, having purchased the same only in 1971; that
the 84 square meters of the land occupied by him is located at <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> Street and not Jones Avenue; that there is no
definite showing as to which portion of the land is 84 square meters located -
all these contemplate questions of fact which can not be resolved by this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said allegations touch on the
very core of the lower court's finding that petitioner is the owner of the
land, a finding which will not be disturbed by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Reyes, et al. vs. Court of
Appeals, L-28466, March 27, 1971, 38 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 138).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the respondent court is hereby
reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the private
respondent, Jose <span class="SpellE">Baliguat</span>, is hereby ordered to
vacate the land in question and to accept from the Clerk of Court the P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> deposited with the latter as valid payment for the value

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MELENCIO-HERRERA, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result.</p>

<p class="BODY">A lessee is neither a builder in good faith nor in bad faith
(Albioso vs. Villanueva, 7 Phil. 277).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His rights are governed not by Article 448 but by Article 1678 of the
Civil Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1678.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
lessee makes, in good faith, useful improvements which are suitable to the use
for which the lease is intended, without altering the form or substance of the
property leased, the lessor upon the termination of the lease shall pay the
lessee one-half of the value of the improvements at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the lessor refuse to reimburse said
amount, the lessee may remove the improvements, even though the principal thing
may suffer damage thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall not,
however, <span class="GramE">cause</span> any more impairment upon the property
leased than is necessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" xxxxxxxxxx</span> "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the foregoing provision that the lessee may
remove the improvements should the lessor refuse to reimburse, but the lessee
does not have the right to buy the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The tenant cannot improve the landlord out of his property."</p>

<p class="BODY">As a practical measure to end this controversy, the P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> consigned by petitioner can be deemed to be one-half
of the value of the house built by private respondent on the land leased to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, if petitioner
should opt not to pay said amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, it
would be private respondent's obligation to remove his house from the portion
of the land occupied by him.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span class="SpellE">TEEHANKEE</span>, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the judgment in the main opinion of Mr. Justice De
Castro ordering respondent to vacate the land and to accept from the Clerk of
Court the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as deposited by petitioner
in payment of the house built by respondent in good faith on petitioner's
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge's judgment of June 18, 1969 providing for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of respondent from petitioner's land upon
petitioner's paying respondent the sum of P3,000.00 by way of indemnity for the
value of the house built thereon by respondent and furthermore that upon
petitioner's failure to pay such indemnity within 90 days from finality of the
judgment, respondent would have the right to buy the land occupied by his house
"at a price to be agreed upon by both parties with the approval of the
court" is patent error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed
out by Mme. Justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Herrera in her separate
opinion, the only right of respondent-lessee is to remove his house should
petitioner (as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>) refuse to pay one-half the
value thereof under Article 1678 of the Civil Code, but the Code gives
respondent-lessee no right whatever to buy the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">But since petitioner withdrew its appeal from respondent judge's
decision, said decision upon its revival with the withdrawal of the appeal, has
become the law of the case, notwithstanding its manifest error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner chose to abide by it and
timely paid by way of consignation the indemnity adjudged in favor of
respondent. Respondent has no other recourse but to vacate the land, by the
terms of the very judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge's questioned Order of <u>December 20, 1973</u>
ruling that his revived decision of June 18, 1969 <u>instantly</u> became final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> (<u>retroactively</u> as of <u>July 24,
1969</u>) upon petitioner's withdrawal on February 1, 1973 of its appeal from
said judgment has been aptly rejected as "<u>absurd</u>" in the
Court's judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bit of sound
discretion and circumspection on the primary objective of the Rules of Court to
assist the parties in obtaining a just and expeditious determination of their
action would have rendered it unnecessary for respondent judge's
"absurd" order (of <u>instant retroactive finality</u> of a decision
upon withdrawal of the appeal) to have reached this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, such "absurd" order
frustrated for over <u>six years</u> until now petitioner's commendable move of
withdrawing its appeal and cutting short the litigation (at the cost of paying
the indemnity erroneously awarded by respondent judge) and prevented petitioner
up to now from recovering the rightful possession of its land as adjudged in
respondent judge's ten-year old judgment of June 18, 1969.</p>
