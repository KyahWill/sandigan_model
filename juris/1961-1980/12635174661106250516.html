				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The right to a day in court is dearly cherished — and under­standably
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, one is enabled to seek the
protection the law affords whenever he can show injury to his person or
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a right, however, must be
seasonably exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For there are
policy considerations of the most exigent character that so compel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be lost, then, under circumstances
amounting to <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is in the appeal before us filed by
appellant Sofia Gonzales <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Delima</span>,
plaintiff below, against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Tio</span>, from an order of
dismissal of the lower court based on <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and the
prescription of the two causes of action for the recovery a the disputed real
property, the transaction out of which the litigation arose dating back to 1936
and the complaint not being filed until May 8, 1964, a period of almost 28
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As would thus be readily
discernible, the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the order of dismissal
appears to be indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint filed by plaintiff on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1964</st1:date> sets forth two causes of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first, after stating the fact of ownership
of property consisting of the coconut land in question, it was alleged that on
August 27, 1936 a contract or agreement was executed in writing whereby for the
sum of P600.00 the property of plaintiff was sold by her husband to Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tio</span>, predecessor-in-interest of defendant, with the right
to repurchase for an unlimited time, such property sold being <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> in character owned jointly by plaintiff with
her sister, <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> Gonzales <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>, who was neither a party to the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was asserted that their
respective husbands did enter into such contract without having been so
authorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was the claim made
that a year or two after August 27, 1936, plaintiff sought the return of such
coconut land, but she was prevailed upon not to insist on such demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1964</st1:date> that the complaint was actually filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second cause of action asserted that, for
reasons unknown to plaintiff, the aforesaid Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tio</span>
included in the transaction another parcel of adjoining coconut land which she
would likewise seek to recover by this complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a motion to dismiss, filed on
November 16, 1964, based on the ground that such first and second causes of
action allegedly existing in favor of plaintiff were barred by the statute of
limitation, defendant moreover having acquired the property, subject matter of
the complaint, by acquisitive prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of dismissal of <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1966</st1:date> sustained such a motion to dismiss on
the ground of the statute of limitation consisting a bar to such a complaint as
well as <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court refrained from ruling on the question of acquisitive
prescription as it "would necessitate the presentation of proof to its
complete satisfaction by means of relevant and competent evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stage of the proceeding for that purpose
has not yet come to pass."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal from such order of dismissal was then taken,
plaintiff seeking, unsuccessfully, as was announced at the opening of this
opinion, to reverse the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
it has to be thus will now be taken up.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is now an established doctrine that inaction and neglect
convert what otherwise could be a valid claim into a stale demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are factors that militate against any
judicial cognizance of a matter that could have been within its ken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such passivity in the face of what might have
given rise to an action in court is visited with the loss of such a right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in essence is what <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
signifies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does ignorance resulting
from inexcusable negligence suffice to explain such failure to file seasonably
the necessary suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the complaint that plaintiff waited until almost
28 years from the time of the transaction before she filed the action on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case not too dissimilar, Rodriguez v.
Rodriguez,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held: "<span class="SpellE">Appelant’s</span> inaction to enforce
her right, for 28 years, cannot be justified by the lame excuse that she
assumed that the transfer was valid." Laurel-Manila v. Galvan,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
an equally recent decision, this Court speaking through justice J. B. L. Reyes,
is even more relevant. Thus: "We find no reversible error in the dismissal
of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even grant­ing that
the order of March 19, 1925, authorizing the sale was invalid in that it did
not state the amount of the debt of the deceased nor the value of his personal
estate, nor was a time and place for hearing and resolving the application
previously set, nor was, due notice thereof ordered to be given to the persons
interested (although this is disputed by defendants), the unexplained interval
of twenty-nine (29) years that plaintiffs allowed to elapse (1925?1954)
before making any claim or instituting action constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>
that places them in <span class="SpellE"><u>estoppel</u></span> to question the
validity of the probate court's order and of the transactions executed in
pursuance thereof * * *. " The lower court was thus on firm ground in
relying on <span class="SpellE">laches</span> for its order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Nor could it entertain any apprehension as to the correctness
of its ruling when in deference to what the then applicable Code of Civil
Procedure provision prescribed, it based its order of dismissal on plaintiff's
right to file the action having prescribed as much more than 10 years had
elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As provided therein: "An
action for recovery of title to, or possession of, real property, or an
interest there­in, can only be brought within ten years after the cause of such
action accrues."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court has, from the two leading cases of <span class="SpellE">Conspecto</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Fruto</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Corporacion</span> de PP. <span class="SpellE">Agustinos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Recoletos</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
consistently applied the literal, language of the above provision limiting to a
period of 10 years after the accrual of the cause of action a suit for recovery
of title to or possession of real property.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A case with features that call to mind the facts alleged in this
complaint is <span class="SpellE">Amar</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pagharion</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
As in the contract here in question, there was no stipulation as to the period
of time within which the vendors could repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As distinguished from this case, however,
there was a repurchase from the vendee, but with money coming from a third
party who thereafter remained in possession, Plaintiffs, the original vendors,
would still assert a right to repurchase the parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court was of a different mind, as
explained in the opinion: "The plaintiffs rest their case on their right
they claim they have to repurchase the parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the defendant's possession of the parcel
of land from 27 October 1927, when he took possession thereof, to 7 December
1949, when the complaint was filed in this case, 22 years, 1 month and 11 days
had already elapsed, which is a period of time sufficient not only to bar the
action but to vest in him title by prescription."</p>

<p class="BODY">That the right of redemption in force under Art.1508 could not be
for an unlimited period, even under a stipulation as that found in the contract
here in question that the vendee had the obli­gation to resell the land at any
time that the vendor could pay him back the amount agreed upon, was made clear
in an earlier case, <span class="SpellE">Aliño</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Adove</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus: "It must not be forgotten that accord­ing to article 1508 of the
Civil Code, in this kind of contracts the period may be either conventional or
legal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former is fisted by the
parties and cannot exceed ten years; the latter is fixed by law at four years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that in every case there is always a
period within which the right of redemption must be exercised, In the case of
Albert and Albert v. <span class="SpellE">Punsalan</span> (9 Phil., 294), this
Court said: ‘Where the property is sold under an agreement of <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro,</u> and the right to
repurchase is not exercised within the time fixed by the agreement or within
the maximum period allowed by the Civil Code when no period is stipulated, the
title of the purchaser becomes absolute.’ In the case of <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Viceo</span> (13 Phil., 97), it was held that: 'In a
contract of sale with a right to repurchase, when no time is specified within
which the repurchase must be made, it must be done within four years.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">There was likewise an allegation in the complaint that a year or
two after August 27, 1936 that the contract was entered into, there was a
demand by plaintiff for the return of the coconut land in question but that she
"was prevailed upon to defer said demand for the return of said property
for one reason or another,"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
one of which was that plaintiff and her husband were godchildren of defendant's
predecessor-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What does
emerge most dearly is that whether the period be counted from the date the
contract was signed on <st1:date year="1936" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1936</st1:date>
or from sometime in August of 1938, in accordance with the above allegation,
much more than 10 years had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, then, plaintiff's cause of action was barred by the above
statutory provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was correctly
held by the lower court.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. In the above <span class="SpellE">Amar</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pagharion</span> decision, it was stated that the complaint having
been filed after 22 years, not only was the action barred but the person in
possession acquired the property by acquisitive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For again, under the Code of Civil Procedure,
10 years actual adverse possession by any person claiming to be the owner for
that time of any land in whatever way his occupancy might have commenced or
continued and under a claim of title exclusive of any other right and adverse
to all other claimants, could result in the acquisition of title thereto by
prescription.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As was clearly set forth in the above leading case of <span class="SpellE">Conspecto</span> v, <span class="SpellE">Fruto</span>, the opinion
of this Court relying almost verbatim on the language of Justice Miller of the
United States Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Probst</span> v. Trustees of
the Board of Domestic Missions: "It is the essence of the statute of
limitations that, whether the party had a right to the possession or not, if he
entered under the claim of such right and remained in possession for the period
(ten years) named in the statute of limitations, the right of action of the
plaintiff who had the better title is barred by that adverse possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right given by the statute of limitations
does not depend upon, and has no necessary connection with, the validity of the
claim under which the possession is held.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise there could be no use for the statute of limitations or
adverse possession as a defense to an ocean, for if the decision is made to
depend upon the validity of the respective titles set up by plaintiff and the
defendant, there can be no place for the consideration of the questions of
adverse possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is because the
plaintiff has a better title that the defendant is permitted to rely upon such
uninterrupted possession, adverse to the plaintiff's title, as the statute
prescribes, it being well understood and an element in such cases, that the
plaintiff does have the better title, but that he has lost it by delay in
asserting it.”</p>

<p class="BODY">While the lower court then did not feel called upon to rely on
acquisitive prescription, it would appear that it could have done so without
its order of dismissal being susceptible to any alleged error having been
committed as a result thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
again, we have been consistent in our decisions that literally apply, the terms
of the above Code of Civil Procedure provision.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> An excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Ongsiaco</span> v. Dallo,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a> the latest decision in point,
penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, speaking for the Court,
supplies additional light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: ”It is
thus admitted that since 1924 or for a period of forty-two years before the
basic complaint was filed in 1966, petitioners had been in possession of the
land claimed by plaintiffs below, now respondents and that such possession, was
adverse, or in concept of owner, although allegedly in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Code of Civil Procedure, formerly
in force, good or bad faith was immaterial, for purposes of acquisitive
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adverse possession in
either character ripened into ownership after the lapse of ten years."</p>

<p class="BODY">While the lower court did exercise caution and did refrain from
making any ruling on the question, of acquisitive pres­cription, it could,
following the above course of decisions, have done so without incurring the
risk of committing error.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. In the light of the above discussion, it is clear that it was
futile for appellant, as she did in her brief, to ascribe to the lower court a
failure to adhere to what the settled law requires both on the question of
prescription, whether extinctive or acquisitive, as she did in her second and
third assigned errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would impart
a novel twist to her argument on the question of acquisitive prescription
ascribing to the order of dismissal the defect of leaving undecided the
ownership of the disputed property as the lower court failed to consider the
effects of adverse possession and did not rule on defendant acquiring title to
such land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A more informed analysis
would have disclosed that insofar as the order of dismissal is based on <span class="SpellE">laches</span> as well as the statutory bar, plaintiff having lost
her right to file the suit through prescription, there is more than sufficient
justification for the challenged actuation of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not much purpose would be served, therefore,
in pursuing further this line of attack by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error would, however, rely on the
allegation that no prescription could lie as the contract was void and
non-existent from the beginning.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> This is on the assumption that the
matter could be governed by the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if it were so, plaintiff suffers from a misapprehension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract dealing as it did with <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> property cannot be considered as void or
non-existent, but merely as unenforceable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it was provided by the old Civil Code in force at the time it was
entered into.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the allegations of her complaint to
the effect, that she did demand of defendant's predecessor-in-interest as well
as from defendant himself the return of said coconut land presumably upon the
payment of the P600.00 which was the consideration would indicate that there
was at least implied ratification.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if such were not the case, however, as is clear from the above <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision, an argument based on the allegation of a
void or non-existent contract obviously lacks persuasiveness.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus evident that it is unwarranted to assert that errors
could justifiably be imputed to the lower court in ordering the dismissal of
the complaint.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. There is more than just a hint of equitable considera­tions on
which plaintiff could rely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to
be admitted, but the force of the above authoritative precedents leaves us no
alter­native but to affirm the order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is by no means to' indicate approval of
what apparently transpired, if the complaint be accepted at its face
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not too much to say that
dependant's predecessor-in-interest in his dealings with plaintiff failed to
exhibit the utmost respect for the promptings of good faith that the situation
would seem to require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did defendant
make matters any easier for plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both of them, it would appear, were motivated solely by the promptings
of inordinate self-interest; they did yield unduly to the temptation to take ad­vantage
of the unfortunate circumstances in which plaintiff found herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regrettably, however, she did allow this state
of things to continue until she lost the right to invoke the appropriate remedy
the law provides so that whatever grievance might have been alleged could be
redressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it any reproach to the
law if in the interest of public peace and stability in property relationship,
a continuing state of incertitude and doubt is put an end to, <span class="SpellE"><u>Vigilantibus</u></span> <u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>dormientibus</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>equitas</u></span> <u>subvenit</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>
This Court then, in submission to such a dictate of public policy, cannot <span class="SpellE">disauthorize</span> what the lower court did.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1966</st1:date> is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

According to Section 41 of the Code of Civil Pro­cedure: "Ten years actual
adverse possession by any person claiming to be the owner for that time of any
land or interest in land, uninterruptedly continued for ten years by occupancy,
descent, grants, or other­wise, in whatever way such occupancy may have com­menced
or continued, shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor of such land a
full and complete title, saving to the persons under disabilities the rights
secured by the next section. In order to constitute such title by prescription
or adverse possession, the- posses­sion by the claimant or by the person under
or through whom he claims must have been actual, open,, public, continuous,
under a claim of title exclusive of any other right and adverse to all other
claimants. But failure to occupy or cultivate land solely by reason of war
shall not be deemed to constitute an interruption of possession of the claimant
and his title by prescription shall be com­plete, if in other respects perfect,
notwithstanding such failure to occupy or cultivate the land during the continu­ance
of war."</p>
