Ortiz <i>vs</i>. Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, et al.",
and the Writ of Execution issued to implement said Order, allegedly for being
inconsistent with the judgment sought to be enforced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. C-90 was filed by <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
Ortiz who sought the review and/or annulment of the decision of the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, giving preference to the sales applications
of private respondents <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Zamora over Lot No. 5785, PLS-45,

<p class="BODY">The factual background of the case, as found by respondent Court,
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * The lot in controversy was formerly the subject of
Homestead Application No. 122417 of Martin <span class="SpellE">Dolorico</span>
II, plaintiff's ward who died on August 20, 1931; that since then it was plaintiff
who continued the cultivation and possession of the property, without however
filing any application to acquire title thereon; that in the Homestead
Application No. 122417, Martin <span class="SpellE">Dolorico</span> II named his
uncle, Martin <span class="SpellE">Dolorico</span> I as his heir and successor in
interest, so that in 1951 Martin <span class="SpellE">Dolorico</span> I executed
an affidavit relinquishing his rights over the property in favor of defendants <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Zamora, his grand son and son-in-law,
respectively, and requested the Director of Lands to cancel the homestead application;
that on the strength of the affidavit, Homestead Application No. 122417 was
cancelled and thereafter, defendants <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> and
Zamora filed their respective sales applications Nos. 8433 and 9258; that
plaintiff filed his protest on November 26, 1951 alleging that he should be
given preference to purchase the lot inasmuch as he is the actual occupant and
has been in continuous possession of the same since 1931; and in spite of
plaintiff's opposition, 'Portion A' of the property was sold at public auction
wherein defendant <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> was the only bidder; that
on June 8, 1957, investigation was conducted on plaintiff's protest by
Assistant Public Lands Inspector <span class="SpellE">Serapion</span> <span class="SpellE">Bauzon</span> who submitted his report to the Regional Land
Officer, and who in turn rendered a decision on April 9, 1958, dismissing
plaintiff's claim and giving due course to defendants' sales applications on
the ground that the relinquishment of the homestead rights of Martin <span class="SpellE">Dolorico</span> I in favor of <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>
and Zamora is proper, the former having been designated as successor in
interest of the original homestead applicant and that because plaintiff failed
to participate in the public auction, he is forever barred to claim the property;
that plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of this decision which was
denied by the Director of Lands in his order dated June 10, 1959; that finally,
on appeal to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the decision
rendered by the Regional Land Officer was affirmed <i>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A peti­tion for review on <i>certiorari</i>
of the decision of the Court of Appeals was denied by this Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point, private respondents filed a
petition for appointment of a new receiver with the court <i>a quo</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was granted and the receiver
was reappointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner sought the
annulment of this Order with the Court of Appeals, but said Court ruled that
its decision had already become final and that the records of the case were to be
remanded to the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with such denial, petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary injunction before this Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

insufficient showing of grave abuse of discre­tion.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
private respondents filed a motion for the execution of the same, praying as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court
to order the issuance of a writ of execution in accordance with the judgment of
this Honorable Court, confirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court,
commanding any lawful officer to deliver to defendants <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>

judgment is already executed, then to <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Zamora;

<blockquote>"Finally, to condemn plaintiff to pay moral damages for

an amount this Court may deem just in the premises."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon the foregoing motion, respondent Judge issued an
Order, dated <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1970</st1:date>,
stating, among others, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"The records further disclosed that from March 1967 to December
31, 1968, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Ortiz collected tolls
on a portion of the property in question wherein he has not introduced any
improvement particularly on Lot No. 5785-A, PLS-45 awarded to defendant <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>, thru which
vehicular traffic was detoured or diverted, and again from September 1969 to
March 31, 1970, the plaintiff resumed the collection of tolls on the same
portion without rendering any accounting on said tolls to the Receiver, who was
reappointed after submitting the required bond and specifically authorized only
to collect tolls leaving the harvesting of the improvements to the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In virtue of the findings of this Court as contained in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of its decision, the defendants are
jointly obligated to pay the plaintiff in the amount of Pl3,632.00 as
reasonable value of the improvements he introduced on the whole property in question,
and that he has the right of retention until fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be gleaned from the motion of the
defendants that if plaintiff submits an accounting of the tolls he collected
during the periods above alluded to, their damages of about P25,000.00 can more
than offset their obligation of P13,362.00 in favor of the plaintiff,
thereafter the possession of the land be delivered to the defendants since the
decision of the Supreme Court has already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
but in the interregnum pending such accounting and recovery by the Receiver of
the tolls collected by the plaintiff, the defendants pray that they be allowed
to put up a bond in lieu of the said P13,632.00 to answer for damages of the
former, if any.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, plaintiff contends in his opposition,
admitting that the decision of the Supreme Court has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; (1) the offer of a bond in lieu of payment of
P13,632.00 does not, and cannot, satisfy the condition imposed in the decision
of this Court which was affirmed <i>in</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>toto</i></span>;
(2) the public sale of Portion 'B' of the land has still to take place as
ordained before the decision could be executed; and, (3) that whatever sums
plaintiff may derive from the property cannot be set off against what is due
him for the improvements he made, for which he has to be reimbursed as ordered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let it be known that plaintiff does not dispute his having
collected tolls during the periods from March 1967 to <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1968</st1:date> and from September 1969 to <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of
this Court in its findings that said tolls belong to the defendants,
considering that the same were collected on a portion of the land in question
where the plaintiff did <i>not</i> introduce any improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reimbursement to the plaintiff pertains
only to the value of the improvements, like coconut trees and other plants
which he introduced on the whole property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The tolls collected by the plaintiff on an unimproved portion naturally
belong to the defendants, following the doctrine on accretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the reappointment of a Receiver by
this Court was upheld by the Supreme Court when it denied the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
filed by the plaintiff, bolstering the legal claim of defendants over said
tolls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the decision of the Supreme
Court rendered the decision of this Court retroactive from <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1966</st1:date> although pending appeal its
implementation was suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our
honest conviction, therefore, that the putting up of a bond by the defendants
pending accounting of the tolls collected by the plaintiff is justified and
will not prejudice anybody, but certainly would substantially satisfy the
conditions imposed in the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, insofar as the one-half portion 'B' of the property, the
decision may be executed only after public sale by the Bureau of Lands shall be
accomplished.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding Motion for Execution filed by the
defendants to be meritorious, the same is granted; provided, however, that they
put up a bond equal the adjudicated amount of P13,632.00 accruing in favor of
the plaintiff, from a reputable or recognized bonding or surety company,
conditioned that after an accounting of the tolls collected by the plaintiff
should there be found out any balance due and payable to him after reckoning
said obligation of P13,632.00 the bond shall be held answerable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, a Writ of Execution was issued after private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>
had filed the required bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ directed
the Sheriff to enforce the decision of the Court, and stated, in part, the
following:</p>

return of your proceedings within this Court within sixty (60) days from date

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1970</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the aforesaid Order and Writ
of Execution, alleging:</p>

<blockquote>"(a) That the respondent judge has no authority to place
respondents in possession of the property;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) That the
Supreme Court has never affirmed any decision of the trial court that tolls
collected from the diversionary road on the property, which is public land,
belong to said respondents;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That to assess
petitioner a P25,000.00 liability for damages is purely punitive imposition
without factual or legal justification."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing Motion for Reconsideration was denied by respondent
Judge per Order dated <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="11">November 18,
 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Order states, in
part:</p>

<blockquote>"It goes without saying that defendant <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>
is entitled to be placed in possession of Lot No. 5785-A of PLS-45 (<span class="SpellE">Calauag</span> Public Land Subdivision) and enjoyment of the tolls
from March, 1967 to March, 1968 and from September, 1969 to March 31, 1970
which were received by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Ortiz,
collected from the property by reason of the diversion road where vehicular
traffic was detoured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To defendant <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> belongs the tolls thus collected from a portion of
the land awarded to him used as a diversionary road by the doctrine of
accretion and his right over the same is <i>ipso</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>jure</i></span>,
there being no need of any action to possess said addition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so because as consistently maintained
by the Supreme Court, an applicant who has complied with all the terms and
conditions which entitle him to a patent for a particular tract of public land,
acquires a vested right therein and is to be regarded as equitable owner
thereof so that even without a patent, a perfected homestead or sales
application is a property right in the fullest sense, unaffected by the fact
that the paramount title is still in the Government and no subsequent law can
deprive him of that vested right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question of the actual damages suffered by defendant <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>
by reason of the unaccounted tolls received by plaintiff had already been fully
discussed in the order of <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="9">September
 23, 1970</st1:date> and the Court is honestly convinced and believes it to be
proper and regular under the circumstances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Incidentally, the Court stands to correct itself when in the
same order, it directed the execution of the decision with respect to the
one-half portion 'B' of the property only after the public sale by the Bureau
of Lands, the same being an oversight, it appearing that the Sales Application
of defendant <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Zamora had already been
recognized and fully confirmed by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view thereof, finding the motion filed by plaintiff to be
without merit, the Court hereby denies the same and the order of September 23,
1970 shall remain in full force subject to the amendment that the execution of
the decision with respect to the one-half portion 'B' shall not be conditioned
to the public sale by the Bureau of Lands.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner thus filed the instant petition, contending that in
having issued the Order and Writ of Execution, respondent Court "acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction, and/or with grave abuse of discretion,
because the said order and writ in effect vary the terms of the judgment they
purportedly seek to enforce." He argued that since said judgment declared
the petitioner a possessor in good faith, he is entitled to the payment of the
value of the improvements introduced by him on the whole property, with right
to retain the land until he has been fully paid such value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise averred that no payment for
improvements has been made and, instead, a bond <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
had been filed by defendants (private respondents), which, according to
petitioner, is not the payment envisaged in the decision which would entitle
private respondents to the possession of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, with respect to portion
"B", petitioner alleges that, under the decision, he has the right to
retain the same until after he has participated and lost in the public bidding
of the land to be conducted by the Bureau of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed that it is only in the event
that he loses in the bidding that he can be legally dispossessed thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the position of petitioner that all the fruits of the
property, including the tolls collected by him from the passing vehicles, which
according to the trial court amounts to P25,000.00, belongs to petitioner and not
to defendant/private respondent <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>, in accordance with the deci­sion itself, which
decreed that the fruits of the property shall be in lieu of interest on the
amount to be paid to petitioner as reimbursement for improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any contrary opinion, in his view, would be
tantamount to an amendment of a decision which has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and, therefore, cannot be lawfully done.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, therefore, prayed that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) a Writ of Preliminary Injunction be
issued enjoining the enforcement of the Orders of September 23, 1970 and
November 18, 1970, and the Writ of Execution issued thereto, or restoring to
petitioner the possession of the property if the private respondents had been
placed in possession thereof; (2) annulling said Orders as well as the Writ of
Execution, dissolving the receivership established over the property; and (3)
ordering private respondents to account to petitioner all the fruits they may
have gathered or collected from the property in question from the time of
petitioner's illegal dispossession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1971</st1:date>,
this Court issued the Writ of Preliminary Injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="1">January

manifested that the amount of P14,040.96, representing the amount decreed in
the judgment as reimbursement to petitioner for the improvements, plus interest
for six months, has already been deposited by them in court, "with the
understanding that said amount shall be turned over to the plaintiff after the
court <i>a</i> <i>quo</i> shall have determined the improvement on Lot 5785-A,
and subsequently the remaining balance of the deposit shall be delivered to the
petitioner (plaintiff therein) in the event he loses the bid for Lot 5785-B in

question and put private respondents in possession thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 10, 1971, petitioner filed a "Comment on
Respondents' 'Motion for Reconsideration' dated January 29, 1971' and
'Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration and Manifestation'", contending that
the tender of deposit mentioned in the Supplemental Motion was not really and
officially made, "inasmuch as the same is <i>not</i> supported by any
official receipt from the lower court, or from its clerk or cashier, as
required by law"; that said deposit does not constitute sufficient
compliance with the judgment sought to be enforced, neither was it legally and
validly made because the requisites for consignation had not been complied
with; that the tender of legal interest for six months cannot substitute petitioner's
enjoyment of the fruits of the property as long as the judgment in Civil Case
No. C-90 has not been implemented in the manner decreed therein; that contrary
to the allegations of private respondents, the value of the improvements on the
whole property had been determined by the lower court, and the segregation of
the improvements for each lot should have been raised by them at the opportune
moment by asking for the modification of the decision before it became final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; and that the tolls on the property
constituted "civil fruits" to which the petitioner is entitled under
the terms of the decision.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue decisive of the <span class="SpellE">controvery</span> is
-- after the rendition by the trial court of its judgment in Civil Case No.
C-90 on March 22, 1966 confirming the award of one-half of the property to <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> -- whether or
not petitioner is still entitled to retain for his own exclusive benefit all
the fruits of the property, such as the tolls collected by him from March 1967
to December 1968, and September 1969 to March 31, 1970, amounting to about
P25,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioner
contends that so long as the aforesaid amount of P13,632.00 decreed in the
judgment representing the expenses for clearing the land and the value of the
coconuts and fruit trees planted by him remains unpaid, he can appropriate for
his exclusive benefit all the fruits which he may derive from the property,
without any obligation to apply any portion thereof to the payment of the
interest and the principal of the debt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find this contention untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that a possessor in good faith is entitled
to the fruits received before the possession is legally interrupted.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Possession in good faith ceases or is legally interrupted from the moment
defects in the title are made known to the possessor, by extraneous evidence or
by the filing of an action in court by the true owner for the recovery of the
property.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, all the fruits that the possessor may receive from the time he is
summoned in court, or when he answers the complaint, must be delivered and paid
by him to the owner or lawful possessor.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, seven after his good faith ceases, the possessor in fact
can still retain the property, pursuant to Article 546 of the New Civil Code,
until he has been fully reimbursed for all the necessary and useful expenses
made by him on the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right
of retention has been considered as one of the conglomerate of measures devised
by the law for the protection of the possessor in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its object is to guarantee the reimbursement
of the expenses, such as those for the preservation of the property,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
or for the enhancement of its utility or productivity.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It permits the actual possessor to remain in possession while he has not been
reimbursed by the person who defeated him in the possession for those necessary
expenses and useful improvements made by him on the thing possessed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal characteristic of the right of
retention is its accessory character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is accessory to a principal obligation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the right of the possessor to receive the fruits terminates
when his good faith ceases, it is necessary, in order that this right to retain
may be useful, to concede to the creditor the right to secure reimbursement
from the fruits of the property by utilizing its proceeds for the payment of
the interest as well as the principal of the debt while he remains in
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right of retention of
the property by the creditor, according to <span class="SpellE">Scaevola</span>,
in the light of the provisions of Article 502 of the Spanish Civil Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
is considered not a coercive measure to oblige the debtor to pay, depriving him
temporarily of the enjoyment of the fruits of his property, but as a means of
obtaining compensation for the debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
right of retention in this case is analogous to a contract of <span class="SpellE">antichresis</span> and it can be considered as a means of
extinguishing the obligation, inasmuch as the right to retain the thing lasts
only for the period necessary to enable the creditor to be reimbursed from the
fruits for the necessary and useful expenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">According to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
the right of retention is, therefore, analogous to that of a pledge, if the
property retained is a movable, and to that of <span class="SpellE">antichresis</span>,
if the property held is immovable.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
This construction appears to be in harmony with similar provisions of the civil
law which employs the right of retention as a means or device by which a
creditor is able to obtain the payment of a debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under Article 1731 of the New Civil
Code, any person who has performed work upon a movable has a right to retain it
by way of pledge until he is paid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, under Article 1914 of the same Code, the agent may retain in
pledge the things which are the object of the agency until the principal
effects reimbursement of the funds advanced by the former for the execution of
the agency, or he is indemnified for all damages which he may have suffered as
a consequence of the execution of the agency, provided he is free from
fault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the same effect, the
depositary, under Article 1994 of the same Code, may retain the thing in pledge
until the full payment of what may be due him by reason of the deposit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span>,
pursuant to Article 612 of the same Code, may retain the property until he is
reimbursed for the amount paid for taxes levied on the capital (Article 597)
and for extraordinary repairs (Article 594).</p>

<p class="BODY">In all of these cases, the right of retention is used as a means
of extinguishing the obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
amply observed by <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>:
"El <span class="SpellE">derecho</span> de <span class="SpellE">retencion</span>,
lo <span class="SpellE">hemos</span> <span class="SpellE">dicho</span>, <span class="SpellE">es</span> el <span class="SpellE">derecho</span> de <span class="SpellE">prenda</span> o el de <span class="SpellE">anticresis</span> <span class="SpellE">constituido</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> la <span class="SpellE">ley</span> con <span class="SpellE">independencia</span> de la <span class="SpellE">voluntad</span> de <span class="SpellE">las</span> <span class="SpellE">partes</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In a pledge, if the thing pledged earns or produces fruits, income, dividends
or interests, the creditor shall compensate what he receives with those which
are owing him.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
In the same manner, in a contract of <span class="SpellE">antichresis</span>, the
creditor acquires the right to receive the fruits of an immovable of his debtor
with the obligation to apply them to the payment of the interest, if owing, and
thereafter to the principal of his credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The debtor can not reacquire enjoyment of the immovable until he has actually
paid what he owes the creditor.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the afore-cited principles to the case at bar,
petitioner cannot appropriate for his own exclusive benefit the tolls which he
collected from the property retained by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was his duty under the law, after deducting the necessary expenses for
his administration, to apply such amount collected to the payment of the
interest, and the balance to the payment of the principal of the obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, therefore, that the disputed tolls, after deducting petitioner's
expenses for administration, belong to <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>, owner of the land through which the toll road
passed, further considering that the same was on portions of the property on
which petitioner had not introduced any improvement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court itself clarified this matter
when it placed the toll road under receivership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The omission of any mention of the tolls in
the decision itself may be attributed to the fact that the tolls appear to have
been collected after the rendition of the judgment of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records further reveal that earnest efforts have been made by
private respondents to have the judgment executed in the most practicable
manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They deposited in court the
amount of the judgment in the sum of P13,632.00 in cash, subject only to the
accounting of the tolls collected by the petitioner so that whatever is due
from him may be set off with the amount of reimbursement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is just and proper under the
circumstances and, under the law, compensation or set off may take place,
either totally or partially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that petitioner is the creditor with respect to the judgment obligation and the
debtor with respect to the tolls collected, <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>
being the owner thereof, the trial court's order for an accounting and
compensation is in accord with law.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the amount of reimbursement to be paid by <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span>, it appears that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision was lacking in specificity, as it merely provided that <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>
are jointly liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When two persons are liable under a contract
or under a judgment, and no words appear in the contract or judgment to make
each liable for the entire obligation, the presumption is that their obligation
is joint or <span class="SpellE"><i>mancomunada</i></span>, and each debtor is
liable only for a proportionate part of the obligation.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
The judgment debt of P13,632.00 should, therefore, be pro-rated in equal shares
to <span class="SpellE">Comintan</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5785-B, it appears that no
public sale has as yet been conducted by the Bureau of Lands and, therefore,
petitioner is entitled to remain in possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not disputed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Zamora.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
After public sale is had and in the event that Ortiz is not declared the
successful bidder, then he should be reimbursed by respondent Zamora in the corresponding
amount for the improvements on Lot 5785-B.</p>
