				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari to review the order dated

      August  5,  1959 of the  Court of First Instance of Nueva

      Vizcaya, directing the execution of petitioners'' bond.
<div align="justify"><p>On  April 13, 1953,  Pablo Española  Estate, Inc. filed

      in  the  court  of  First Instance  of Nueva Vizcaya  an

      action against Raymundo Guinsatao for the  recovery of

      the sum of P9,360.   It  applied for a writ of  preliminary

      attachment on the  ground  that  Guinsatao had removed

      or was  about to remove his  properties  with intent to

      defraud his creditors. </p>
<p>Guinsatao denied the allegations of the  complaint  and
  
expressed willingness to  file a  counterbound to discharge the writ of preliminary attachment applied for by Pablo
  
 Española Estate Inc.  Whereupon, the court ordered him "to file a counterbond within 5 days  from the receipt of
  
 this order, in the  amount of P9,360.00 to secure the payment  to the  plaintiff of  any judgment he may recover in
  
 the present  case.</p>
<p>Guinsatao  filed  a bond entitled "Defendant's  Bond"
  
 which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Whereas, in an action now pending in the Court of
First Instance of the Province of Nueva Viscaya, First Judicial
District, wherein PABLO ESPAÑOLA ESTATE INC., is plaintiff, and
RAYMUNDO GUINSATAO defendant, the above-named plaintiff has applied for
an order of a Writ of Preliminary Attachment against RAYMUNDO GUINSATAO.</p>
  <p>"And whereas,  the Law allows  the  plaintiff certain securities:</p>
  <p> "Know  all men by these presents: That  RAYMUNDO  GUINSATAO of Mabasa,  Dupax, Nueva Vizcaya as  principal and
          
ESTEBAN  VADIL,   EUGENIO  VADIL,  JUAN  GALIBOSO,
          
 JOAQUIN VADIL, VICTOR VADIL and VICENTE VADIL all
          
 of Mabasa, Dupax, Nueva Vizcaya  as sureties, are hereby held and
          
 in the  sum of NINE THOUSAND  THREE HUNDRED SIXTY
          
 (P9,360.00) PESOS, for which payment well  and truly to be made
          
 we  bind ourselves, our heirs,  and legal  representatives,  jointly
          
 and  severally, firmly  by these presents.</p>
  <p>"The  condition of this  obligation is  as  follows:</p>
  <p>"To pay all the costs which may be awarded to  the defendant,
            
and  all damages  that the defendant  may suffer by reason  of the
            
Writ of Preliminary  Attachment  should it  be  finally adjudged
            
that the same  was done  without legitimate  cause.</p>
  <p>"Then  this obligation shall be null and  void, otherwise of full
              
force and virtue.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The  case was then  tried, after which the trial  court
            
rendered judgment ordering Guinsatao  to pay respondent
            
Pablo  Española Estate Inc. the  sum of P9,360 plus  legal
            
interest.   After the  decision  become  final,  execution followed but Guinsatao had no  sufficient property. And so,
          
on motion of Pablo Española Estate Inc., the lower court
          
ordered the execution of the bond.  Hence, this petition.</p>
<p>While this  case  was pending in  this  Court,  petitioner
            
Joaquin Vadil moved for the dismissal of the case as to
            
him  on the  ground that he had not engaged the services
            
of Attorneys Primicias and  Del Castillo.  While joining
            
in the motion to  dismiss the  case  as to  Joaquin Vadil,
            
Atty. Teodoro Regino  of the law firm of Primicias and
            
Del  Castillo denied  Joaquin's  allegation and asked  that
            
Joaquin Vadil be cited for contempt for allegedly telling
            
falsehood.</p>
<p>As prayed for by Joaquin  Vadil, this  case is dismissed
              
as to  him. There is  no ground in  the  motion to  cite
            
Joaquin Vadil for  contempt.</p>
<p>We  now  come to the merits  of  this case.   Petitioners
              
contend that they  are not liable to the plaintiff  in the
              
trial court because their  undertaking under the bond was
              
to pay "all the costs which may be awarded to the defendant, and  all damages  that the  defendant  may suffer  by
              
reason  of the Writ of Preliminary  Attachment should  it
              
be  finally adjudicated that  the  same was done  without
              
legitimate cause"  rather than  to pay the judgment that
              
plaintiff might  recover.</p>
<p>This is  a case  where,  instead  of a  bond conditioned
              
on the payment to the plaintiff of any judgment which he
              
may recover in an action, as the trial court directed, the
              
bond filed provides that the  sureties  will  pay—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>***all the costs  which may be awarded to the <i>defendant</i>, and
                      
all damages that the <i>defendant</i> may suffer  by reason of the Writ
                      
of Preliminary Attachment should it be finally adjudged that the
                      
same was done without legitimate cause," </p>
</blockquote>
<p>thus raising doubt as  to whether the  petitioners, as  sureties, understood the import of the order of the court.</p>
<p> This doubt, as  to whether  petitioners  understood the
                  
court order, is further shown by the fact that under  Section 2 of Rule  59 of the Rules  of Court, the issuance of
                  
an order of attachment may be prevented if the defendant
                  
''makes deposit or gives bond * * * in an amount sufficient
                  
to  satisfy such demand,  besides costs, or<i> in an  amount
                  
equal to the value of the property which is to be attached.</i>" Now, if, as alleged in the motion of Pablo Española Inc.,
                  
only P150 was  realized from the sale of Guinsatao's property,  it  is not  likely that  petitioners  would  agree  to
                  
stand surety  for P9,360  for the  defendant,  whose properties  (worth only P150)  stood in imminent  danger  of
                  
attachment.</p>
<p>We are inclined to  resolve the doubt in favor of petitioners.   As  this  Court held  in People  <i>vs.</i>  De la  Cruz,
                    
93  Phil., 487; 49 Off. Gaz., No.  8, 3389,  sureties  are favorites  of the law.  Assuming an obligation  without any
                    
thought of material  gain,  except  in  some instances, all
                    
presumption are  indulged in their favor.  And in  Pacific
                    
Tobacco Co. <i>vs.</i> Lorenzana, et al., 102 Phil. 234, this Court
                    
said in  amplification: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"***The rationale of this doctrine is reasonable; an accommodation surety acts without motive of pecuniary gain and, hence,
    
should be protected  against  unjust pecuniary  impoverishment  by
    
imposing on the principal duties akin to those of a fiduciary.  This
    
cannot be said of compensated corporate surety which is a business
    
association organized for the purpose of assuming classified  risks
    
in large  numbers, for profit  and on  an impersonal  basis, through
    
the medium of standardized  written contractual forms drawn  by
    
its  own  representatives  with the  primary  aim of  protecting  its
    
interest.   (See  Stearn's The Law   Suretyship, 4th ed. 402-403).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> We  hold there fore that  petitioners are not liable  to
  
Pablo  Española Estate, Inc. on their bond.</p>
<p> Another reason in  support of the  conclusion reached
    
herein  is that actually there was no  writ of attachment
    
issued by the Court.   It is  to be noted that the obligation
    
to be assumed by the bondsmen  is premised  upon the issuance  of such a writ.</p>
<p> We feel it unnecessary to  pass upon  the  other assignments of error.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the petition is granted;  the  writ of preliminary  injunction  is  made permanent  and  the order
      
dated August  5,  1939 and  the writ of execution dated
      
September 4, 1959 are hereby set aside, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
