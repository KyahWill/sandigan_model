				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Republic has appealed from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch II (Judge Hon. Pedro
Navarro presiding), in its Naturalization Case No. 688, dated 5 April 1967,
declaring applicant <span class="SpellE">Yoy</span> On, alias Ah <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chan, possessed of "all the qualifications, and
none of the disqualifications enumerated in the law to become a Filipino
citizen".</p>

<p class="BODY">Applicant's petition was filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="11">23 November 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His real name is <span class="SpellE">Yoy</span> On, but was known from
childhood as Ah <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chan, and was enrolled and
registered by that name in the schools that he attended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was born in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
on <st1:date year="1927" day="27" month="8">27 August 1927</st1:date>, of
Chinese parents, and is a citizen of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Nationalist China</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applicant is married to Juanita Chan, also a Chinese
national, and they have three children, Florence, born 10 February 1960;
Alberto, born 1 April 1961; and Manuel, born on 28 March 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three children are registered in the
Bureau of Immigration; <st1:city><st1:place>Florence</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="2">8 February 1961</st1:date>; Alberto on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="2">7 February 1963</st1:date>; and Manuel on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="8">26 August 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner owns no real property and his net income is mainly
derived from juke boxes that he rented to various establishments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown by his income tax declarations, his
net income (before deductions) was P5,498.60 in 1963; P3,052.20 in 1964; and
P4,703.40 in 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter year he
also derived income from his bakery business (Tip Top Bakery) in which he
engaged in 1965 and 1966, receiving <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> a net
of P112.64 for 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">The State objected to the proposed naturalization on the grounds
of lack of lucrative income, lack of proper and irreproachable conduct and <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> of the witnesses named in the application, <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quijance</span> of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city> and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objections were overruled by the trial
court hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our scrutiny of the record compels us to agree with the Solicitor
General that the admission of applicant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was
improper and should be reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Most serious objection against the application is the applicant's
disregard of our immigration and revenue laws.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the date of birth of his three children and of their registration
in the Bureau of Immigration, it is apparent that the applicant did not register
his children until long after the 30 days afterbirth prescribed by the 1950
Regulations for Registration of aliens issued under the Alien Registration Act
(Republic Act 562), thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">In Koa <span class="SpellE">Heng</span> vs. Republic, L-21079, 28
February 1966 (16 SCRA 232), and Emmanuel Lai vs. Republic L-22619, promulgated
28 March 1969 (27 SCRA 754), this Court held that a late registration of an
applicant's children constitutes a double infraction of the law, being a
violation not only of immigration regulations, but also of the Alien
Registration Act; and that such violations constitute "improper and
reproachable conduct in his relation with the government, which renders him
disqualified to be a naturalized citizen".</p>

<p class="BODY">The court below accepted, with precipitate credulity, the
applicant's excuse that the delay was due to the lack of registration forms at
the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
branch of the Bureau of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
only was there no competent evidence of this excuse, but its flimsiness is
readily apparent, since applicant delayed registering his children three times
in succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not only improbable
that there should be a dearth of blank forms at the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
branch for three years running, but <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> is so near
the head Immigration Office in Manila where such forms could be obtained that
the excuse becomes unacceptable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same thing can be said of the applicant's conducting his
bakery business during 1966, without renewal of his 1965 permit from the Bureau
of Commerce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The excuse given is that he
did apply for renewal but the same was not acted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is this not a lawful excuse, but the
filing of the application is not properly established.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that the applicant <span class="SpellE">Yoy</span> On
alias Ah <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chan has not conducted himself in a
proper and irreproachable manner, as required by Section 2, third paragraph, of
the Revised Naturalization law (C. A. 473, as amended); hence his application
should have been denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of his two character witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quijance</span> admitted that he had lost contact with
applicant and knew nothing of his conduct from 1941 to 1948, for during said
period the witness had returned to <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, while <span class="SpellE">Yoy</span> An remained in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering besides that this witness was a
driver of applicant's brother, he can not be considered a trustworthy and
reliable insurer of the applicant's character and conduct, and hence is not a
"credible witness" within the contemplation of the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant's net income, before deductions, being less
than P500.00 a month, is certainly not adequate to support himself, his wife
and his three children, considering the increasing cost of living, so as to
negate the danger of their becoming charges upon the resources of the State,
which is what the naturalization law seeks to avoid by requiring that applicants
possess lucrative trade or occupation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed and the
application for naturalization of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Yoy</span> On alias Ah <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chan is
ordered dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against
