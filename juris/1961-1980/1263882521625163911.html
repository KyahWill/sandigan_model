				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Attorney William E. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span> (admitted
to the bar in 1939) was the counsel of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> and Antonio Romano in Civil Case No. 5624 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> branch entitled "Felipe <span class="SpellE">Gonowon</span> versus <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> and Antonio Romano".</p>

<p class="BODY">That damage suit was filed in June, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gonowon</span> prayed that
<span class="SpellE">Requio</span> and Romano be ordered to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to him damages amounting to P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> which were allegedly suffered by him when his bus was
bumped by defendants' bus.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the substantial legal services rendered by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span>, the record shows that he filed an answer dated <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1963</st1:date> and a manifestation dated
<st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1965</st1:date> as to
defendants' admissions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He appeared at
eleven hearings, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>July 20, and
September 8, 1966, May 12, 1967, February 29, May 2, July 26 and October 3,
1968, and February 14 and 19, June 26 and October 2, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eight witnesses testified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than thirty exhibits were offered in
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span> said that, for those
legal services, he received from <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> as
compensation the sum of P385, itemized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">He said that <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>
had agreed to pay him P500 for handling the case in the trial court and that <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> owed him P115 as the unpaid balance of the
stipulated attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in its decision dated <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1970</st1:date> ordered <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>
and Romano to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to <span class="SpellE">Gonowon</span>
damages amounting to P5<span class="GramE">,920</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Requio</span> had
"attached his bus operation to Romano's franchise").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found that <span class="SpellE">Requio's</span>
bus, after having had a tire blowout, bumped <span class="SpellE">Gonowon's</span>
bus, which had stopped to unload passengers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court found <span class="SpellE">Requio's</span> <span style="">tire </span>to be "quite old and
unreliable".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It characterized the
accident as an <span class="SpellE">allision</span>, not a collision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Requio's</span> behalf, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span> perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals from
that decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was dismissed
in that Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1973</st1:date> because Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span> did not
file any brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He explained that he did
not file any brief because <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> decided not to
"proceed with the appeal on account of financial reverses and difficulties
due to his illness and that of his wife".</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="7">July 5,
 1973</st1:date> Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span> apprised <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> of the dismissal of the appeal and the fact <span style="">that the lower
court's </span>judgment had become final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He warned <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We can therefore expect that the next
move of plaintiff is to ask for the execution of the lower court's
decision."</p>

<p class="BODY">Two years and five months after receiving that letter, or on <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1975</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>
filed a complaint charging Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span> with
"serious misconduct and negligence".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue is whether
under the pleadings herein <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> </span>has <span style="">shown a </span><u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facie</span></u><span style=""> case against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dy-Liacco</span> that would
warrant a full-dress investigation of his charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Requio's</span> complaint is that he allegedly paid to
the respondent the total sum of P1<span class="GramE">,885</span> "for
expenses in the appeal of his case" and that, notwithstanding such
payment, the respondent did not file any appellant's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Requio</span> has no
receipts to substantiate that allegation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When he was required to produce documentary evidence proving his
alleged payment of P1,885 to the respondent, he <span class="SpellE">alibied</span>
that the receipts, together with other papers, were left in a taxicab which he
and his wife took upon arrival at the <span class="SpellE">Paco</span> railroad
station on February 9, 1976 and that his efforts to locate the taxicab were
fruitless.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand,
respondent's version is that, as already indicated, for his services in the
trial court, <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> paid him only P385 out of the
stipulated fee of P500; that he (respondent) advanced the sum of P120 as appeal
bond and has never been reimbursed of that amount; that <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>
abandoned the appeal because he had no money to defray the expenses for
prosecuting it, including respondent's attorney's fees (par. 6, Supplemental
Rejoinder, p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>); that another factor which
caused <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> to lose interest in the appeal was that
he had received from the insurer P3,500, and that <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>
told the respondent that, even if the decision against him were to be executed,
the judgment creditor would not get anything because he (<span class="SpellE">Requio</span>)
had no real properties declared in his name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully weighed the conflicting contentions of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our conclusion is that <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> has not shown in his <span style="">pleadings </span>any compelling justification for requiring respondent
lawyer to undergo the rigors of an investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Requio's</span> allegation that he paid to the
respondent the total sum of P1<span class="GramE">,885</span> (P1,000 for the
prosecution of the appeal) and that the receipts were lost, when the baggage
where they were contained, was left in a taxicab on <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1976</st1:date>, is not credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Loss of papers, because they were left in a
motor vehicle, is a common subterfuge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could have attached copies of the receipts to the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not do so although the receipts were
the bases of his complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to <span class="SpellE">Requio's</span> explanation of <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1976</st1:date>, the receipts were
lost when <u>he and his wife</u> boarded a taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That allegation is inconsistent with his
wife's affidavit, attached to the same explanation, that the baggage containing
the receipts was lost when she and her <u>son</u>, Rodrigo, and her <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span>, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Estares</span>, boarded a taxicab at the <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>
railroad station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Requio</span>,
the husband, is not mentioned in that affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Requio</span> does not dispute respondent's
allegation that he (<span class="SpellE">Requio</span>) was the one who paid
directly to the Court of Appeals the docket fee of P53 on <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1972</st1:date> as shown in Official Receipt No.
98442259.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent had wired <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> on <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="7">July 25,
 1972</st1:date> that the docket fee should be paid on or before <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, according to <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>, he paid to the
respondent P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> to cover the expenses of the appeal,
then it would not have been necessary for the respondent to ask him to remit
P53 for the docket fee nor for <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> to pay that
amount to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as
above noted, <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> paid the docket fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That payment signifies that he never gave any
amount to the respondent, much less the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
to defray the expenses of the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the lathes of <span class="SpellE">Requio</span> and the
other inconsistencies in his averments show that his complaint is <span style="">devoid of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Requio</span></span><span style=""> admits that in <u>July, 1973</u> the
respondent wrote to him that the appeal was dismissed, that the lower court's
judgment had become final, </span>and <span style="">that
execution would follow that dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Yet, in spite of that admission, he alleged in his complaint that
he came to know of the dismissal only in <u>October, 1974</u>, when he
conferred with the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in
that same complaint, he alleged that he c<span style="">a</span>me
to know of the dismissal on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="12"><u>December
 4, 1975</u></st1:date> when he was shown in the Court of Appeals the
resolution dismissing his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is manifest that <span class="SpellE">Requio's</span> complaint
herein contains inconsistencies which are inconsistent with his admission that
he came <span style="">to know of the dismissal in
July, 1973 when he received respondent's letter apprising him that his appeal
was dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that no malice or inexcusable neglect can be
imputed to the respondent in not filing the brief and that <span class="SpellE">Requio</span>,
who was unable to pay respondent's fees and the expenses for printing the
brief, abandoned his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Compare
with <span class="SpellE">Heredia</span> vs. Salinas, 10 Phil. 157 where a lawyer
who did not seasonably appeal the adverse decision against his client was absolved
from the client's suit for damages, and <span class="SpellE">Ventanilla</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, 110 Phil. 811 where a lawyer who failed
to appeal was adjudged liable to pay P200 as damages to his client).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the complaint against respondent <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dy-Liacco</span></span><span style=""> is dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
