				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by writ of certiorari taken by <span class="SpellE">Rileco</span>
Inc. from an order of the Court of Industrial Relations in Case No. <span style="">69-MC-DB, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Department of Labor, pursuant to the
provisions of Section 12 of R. <span style="">A. </span><span style="">No. 875 is hereby requested to conduct an election
among </span>the eligible workers in the ramie culture of the <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span> Plantation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appropriate collective bargaining unit is composed of <span class="GramE">all</span> the workers whose names appear in Exhibit 'X-Court', <span style="">Ramie </span>Project, numbering 176 workers
in all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon termination of the
election, the results shell forthwith <span class="GramE">be</span> submitted to
this Court for its further disposition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contending unions are the Mindanao Congress of Labor-Ramie United
Farm Workers' <span style="">A</span><span style="">s</span><span style="">sociation-Local
and the <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> Plantation Laborers Union-Mindanao
Association of Agricultural and Industrial Labor."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case below involved a
petition for certification election filed by the Mindanao Congress of
Labor-Ramie, United Farm Workers' Association-Local, a legitimate labor
organization, claiming that more than 10% of the employees and laborers of the <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span> Plantation - owned by <span class="SpellE">Rileco</span>
- were its members; that no certification election had been conducted at such
plantation for the past twelve months immediately prior to the filing of its
petition, and praying that </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">certification election be ordered held.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Herein petitioner filed a
motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">valid and binding collective bargaining agreement already existed
between it, on the one hand, and, on the other, the <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>
Plantation Laborers Union, </span>a <span style="">duly
registered labor union which represented a majority of the employees of said
plantation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, petitioner
filed a supplemental motion to </span><span style="">dismiss </span><span style="">the
petition upon the ground that the Court of Industrial Relations </span><span style="">did </span><span style="">not have juris­diction to entertain it because the <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span>
plantation was engaged solely in agricultural work and, consequently, its
laborers were agricultural laborers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4"><span style="">April
 22, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> the respondent
Court of Industrial Relations issued the order appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only question raised
now </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">whether or not the ramie </span><span style="">culture in which
petitioner is admittedly engaged in its <span class="SpellE">Mano<span style="">lita</span></span></span><span style=""> plantation is an agricultural or an
industrial undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">If </span><span style="">it is </span><span style="">of the latter nature, the order appealed from
must be set aside because the Court of Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction
over the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
above issue the relevant provisions of Section 2, Republic Act 602 are to this
effect:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"'Agricultural' includes farming in all its branches and <span style="">among other </span>things
includes the cul­tivation and tillage of the soil, dairying, the production,
cultivation, growing, and harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural
commodities, the raising of livestock or poultry, <u>and </u><u><span style="">any </span>practices performed by a farmer </u><u><span style="">or on f</span>arm
as an incident to or in conjunction with some farming operations, but does not
include the manufacturing or processing </u><u><span style="">of </span></u><u><span style="">sugar,
coconuts, </span></u><u><span style="">abaca, tobacco,
pineapples or other farm products</span></u><span style="">.” (Underscoring Supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the nature of ramie culture the respondent court found that
the whole process known as such end in which the <span class="SpellE">Manolita</span>
plantation was engaged consisted of the preparation of the soil, planting of
ramie roots and caring thereof for at least one-hundred days; then the ramie
stalks are cut and delivered to the stripping sheds where they are stripped
with the use of decorticating machines powered by electricity; then the wet
fibers are dried under the sun for one day and later made to pass through the
brusher to cleanse them of impurities; that thereafter the fibers are deemed
ready for the market.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Benjamin Celestial, et al. vs. The Southern
Mindanao Experimental Station et al. 57 O. G. 8461 which involved a similar
process or functions, <span class="GramE">We</span> said -</p>

<blockquote>"Where an experimental station operates <span style="">a </span>farm
comprising 960 hectares, and, through its employees and laborers actually tills
the soil, introduces and plants <span style="">seeds </span>of the best crop (principally cacao)
varieties found by it after study and experiment, raises said crops in the best
approved methods of cultivation, including the spacing of each plant or seed<span style="">ling and the amount of water needed through
irrigation, weeding, etc. and the proper harvesting of the crops, including the
timing and method, discovers plant </span><span style="">pests </span><span style="">and
their eradication by means of treatment with the proper insecticides, and,
thereafter, <u>extracts the seeds </u>from the <u>harvest for sale</u> and
distribution to farmers, there can be no <u>question tha</u></span><u><span style="">t</span></u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">al</span></u><u><span style="">l</span></u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">these acts </span></u><u><span style="">and functions</span></u><span style=""> ... <u>are agricultural</u> as <u>distinguished
from non-a</u></span><u><span style="">g</span></u><u><span style="">ricu</span></u><u><span style="">ltural</span></u><u><span style=""> functions</span></u><span style="">." (Underscoring Supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the Celestial case involved a farm or plantation dedicated
to the growing and cultivation of c<span style="">a</span>c<span style="">ao </span>and other plant seeds, it can not be
denied that there is a great similarity between the processes therein discussed
and the ones involved in ramie culture.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner has invited our attention to case No.
95-MC-DB entitled "Petition for Certification <span style="">as </span>Sole Collective Bargaining Representative of the Workers of <span class="SpellE">Odel</span> Plantation in the Court of Industrial Relations"
where the Court of Industrial Relations itself held that the production of
hemp, abaca and copra and the use of stripping machines in connection with its
harvesting which ends with the classification and packaging of the products
ready for marketing are "purely agricultural work"; that although the
plantation therein questioned raised <span style="">abaca
</span>and processed it until it was ready for marketing, the processing did
not convert the abaca into another product, and that the mere use of modern
machines as <span style="">a </span>labor saving
device does not alter the agricultural nature of the product.</p>

<p class="BODY">This, while not binding on us, would seem to be reasonable
construction of the law and must be applied likewise to the processing of ramie
fiber.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, We hereby rule <span style="">that </span>the ramie process or culture as
described in the appealed order is purely agricultural in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the writ prayed for is granted
and the decision under review <span style="">is </span>set
aside, with costs.</p>
