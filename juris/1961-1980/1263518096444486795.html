				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 23, 1960 petitioner
Wilfredo Lim @ Wilfredo </span>Uy filed a petition for naturalization with the
Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros, to which was attached the joint
affidavit of his character witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After due publication, the petition was heard on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, 1961 the trial court issued an <span style="">order </span>granting the petition <span style="">for naturalization and ordering </span>that
the proper naturalization certificate be issued to petitioner, the order
providing further that it shall not become executory until after the lapse of
two <span style="">years from </span>the date of its
promulgation <span style="">and after compliance with
the requisites prescribed by Republic Act No. 530.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 16, 1961 the Provincial Fiscal of Oriental Negros moved
for a reconsideration of the abovementioned <span style="">order upon two grounds, namely, that </span><span style="">petitioner had not </span><span style="">satisfactorily
proved </span><span style="">his alleged chinese
(nationalist) </span><span style="">citizenship and
that <span style="">his evidence was insufficient to
prove that he was gainfully employed as required by the Revised Naturalization
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding the motion for re­</span></span><span style="">consideration to be
well founded, the trial court set aside its order of June 20, 1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
October 5 of </span><span style="">the same </span><span style="">year petitioner moved for a new trial on the </span><span style="">ground of the </span><span style="">alleged newly
discovered evidence enumerated in his pleading.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Over the opposition of the Provincial Fiscal the trial court granted the
motion for new trial and set the </span><span style="">case for the </span><span style="">reception of the alleged newly discovered
evidence on September 11, 1961, and after receiving the same, on February 1962
said court issued </span><span style="">a new order </span><span style="">granting the petition for naturalization, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">dispositive part of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the petitioner is <span style="">GRANTED and </span>it is ordered that the proper Naturalization
Certificate be issued to petitioner WIL<span style="">FREDO
LIM, which certificate shall be regis</span><span style="">tered </span><span style="">as required by Section 10 of Act No. </span><span style="">3753.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this Order shall
not become executory until after the lapse of two (2) years from the date of
promulgation and after complying with the requisites prescribed by Republic Act
No. 530." (pp. 70-71, rec. on appeal).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The State appealed in due time from the last order and now prays
for a reversal thereof on the ground that <span style="">the
trial court committed the following errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING A NEW TRIAL TO RECEIVE FORGOTTEN,
NOT NEWLY DISCO­VERED EVIDENCE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT PETITIONER USES AN ALIAS
WITHOUT COURT AUTHORITY AND IN VIOLATION OF LAW.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER HAS ACTUAL
EMPLOYMENT AND LUCRA­TIVE INCOME.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE PETITION WAS NOT
PUBLISHED IN A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">V</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT <span style="">HOLDING
</span>THAT THE CHARACTER WITNESSES HAD NO OPPOR<span style="">TUNITY TO OBSERVE PETITIONER'S CONDUCT.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">VI</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE PETITION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first assignment of error, it is clear that the alleged
newly <span style="">discovered </span>evidence
presented by petitioner was not newly discovered but forgotten<span style=""> evidence; </span><span style="">something that petitioner already knew or should have known at the time
he filed his petition for naturalization or </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">the time </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">petition was heard
on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As far as the second alleged error is concerned, petitioner
admits having used the alias WILFREDO UY in addition to his name WILFREDO LIM
appearing in his birth certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
character witnesses also knew him by either one of both names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His school record also shows that he had been
using the name UY WILFREDO.</p>

<p class="BODY">That petitioner used the alias mentioned above with­out proper
authority and had, in fact, never applied for such authority was openly
admitted by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(T.S.N. Espiri­tu, p.
90).</p>

<p class="BODY">In relation to the issue raised in the third assignment of error,
petitioner tried to prove that he had a lucrative income as a purchasing agent
in Cebu City for the Lim Quico Trading.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said firm was owned by his father - who was not <span style="">a </span><span style="">Filipino citizen - </span>was managed by his brother and was engaged in
the relatively small <span style="">town </span>of Jamalalud, Oriental Negros, in the business of buying
and selling corn mill.</p>

<p class="BODY">As there is no sufficient evidence in the record to show that the
aforesaid trading firm needed a purchasing <span style="">agent in Cebu City; considering further that petitioner's </span><span style="">alleged employment was not reported to the
Social Security System for coverage, and that the business in which the firm of
his father was engaged was a <u>nationalized</u> business, it is not
unreasonable to pre­sume that his alleged employment was fictitious, in­vented
exclusively to make it appear that petitioner had a lucrative income for the
purposes of his appli­cation for Philippine citizenship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the conclusions we have arrived at in connection with
the first three assignments of error, We do not deem it necessary to consider
and resolve the issues covered by the others.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is reversed and set
aside, with costs.</p>
