				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><p> Romeo Almodiel filed a petition against spouses Romulo Legarde and
Adelina Latigay before the Court of Agrarian Relations to recover 3,961
budded citrus and 3,900 citrus seedlings, or their value, in the
aggregate amount of P5,143.30, with legal interest thereon from the
filing of the petition. It is alleged that in the month of July, 1958,
petitioner and respondents entered into a verbal tenancy contract to
operate a citrus nursery on the land of respondents situated in
Lambunao, Iloilo, upon the condition that the budded citrus shall be
divided in the proportion of 1/3 as share of respondents and 2/3 as
share of petitioner, but that on February 6, 1960, respondents ejected
petitioner from the land thereby causing him damages.</p>
<p> Respondents in their answer alleged that there was no tenancy
relationship between them and petitioner, nor did they eject him from
the land as he claimed, the truth being that petitioner abandoned the
nursery without the knowledge and consent of respondents. Because of
such abandonment, respondents suffered damages.</p>
<p> Issues having been joined, the agrarian court set the case for
hearing during which the parties agreed on some facts and presented
additional evidence. And among the facts agreed upon are: Petitioner
would furnish at his expense all the seedlings and seeds that may be
necessary to establish the citrus nursery. He will also furnish the
technical know-how in the care, cultivation, budding, and balling of
the budded citrus. Respondents, on the other hand, would furnish (1)
the land necessary for the nursery; (2) all the farm labor at their
cost; (3) the insecticide or fungicide that would be necessary; (4) the
board and lodging of petitioner during the duration of the tenancy; and
(5) all chemicals, fertilizers, and bud tapes, such as bees, wax and
resin.</p>
<p> The evidence of petitioner discloses that' he brought from Lipa
City to Lambunao, Iloilo, 20,000 seedlings less than one foot high
which he planted in the nursery, out of which 10,000 survived. He also
brought 3 1/2 gantas of citrus seeds. He budded the 10,000 seedlings
and only 6,100 were successful. On the basis of 2/3 for petitioner and
1/3 for respondents, 4,067 trees should belong to him while 2,033
should belong to respondents. Out of 2,033 trees, respondents got 1,372
from the nursery and planted them in their orchard, aside from 156
which they sold to some persons as partial payment of their share. Out
of petitioner's share of 4,067,he sold 106 at P1.20 per tree.</p>
<p> On February 6, 1960, he went with respondent Romulo Legarde to the
nursery to ball 3,961 trees. Shortly thereafter, Legarde disappeared
only to appear sometime in the afternoon and angrily stopped the
balling. He approached Legarde and asked what happened to which Legarde
replied that petitioner should go back to Batangas otherwise something
will happen to him. At that time Legarde was armed wife a pistol.
Having heard that Legarde wanted to kill him, he reported the matter to
the Chief of Police of Lambunao and the PC Commander of Iloilo. The
price per tree of 3,961 budded citrus is P1.20, while that of the
seedlings is P0.10 per seedling. The nursery project started in 1958.</p>
<p> The evidence of respondents shows that petitioner brought from
Batangas 15,000 seedlings out of which 11,000 were planted and 4,000
withered and were thrown away. Of the 11,000 planted 2,000 died. Of the
9,000 that were budded, only 4,000 grew. They balled 894 trees and
planted them in the demonstration lot as per their agreement but
petitioner sold 106 trees because he needed money. Petitioner stayed in
their house from July, 1958 to February, 1960, free board and lodging.
Petitioner was not ejected. He asked permission from Romulo Legarde to
go to Iloilo but he did not return. They were willing to have him back
because the plants in the nursery would die for lack of proper care. He
was selling 1,600 plants to overseer Mallari for P600.00 which was too
cheap and so he was advised to wait for Romulo's wife. Because of this
petitioner got angry. On February 6, 1960, after lunch, he asked
permission to go to barrio Agserap. On the following day, Sunday, he
returned to respondents' house, got his bag, asked permission to go to
Iloilo and never returned.</p>
<p> Without passing on the merits of the claims of both parties
concerning their disagreement and the damages they have allegedly
suffered, the agrarian court confined the issue to the question of
jurisdiction since that issue was raised by respondents in their answer
based on the theory that there was no tenancy relationship between the
parties. And after dwelling on the nature of the contract entered into
between them relative to the establishment of the nursery, the court
concluded that there was no tenancy relationship and so it dismissed
the petition on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p> Almodiel interposed the present petition for review.</p>
<p> In reaching the conclusion that there was no tenancy relationship
between the parties, the agrarian court made the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "There is no question that the agreement was to
operate a nursery for budded citrus for sale to the public on the
sharing basis of 2/3 for the petitioner and 1/3 for the respondents.
There was no agreement that the original citrus plants, or the budded
ones would be planted or transplanted, taken care of and made to bear
fruits after which they would divide the fruits or the proceeds thereof
in accordance with their agreement. Simply, the agreement was that, out
of the budded citrus plants or trees which would successfully grow, 2/3
of them or the proceeds thereof would belong to the petitioner while
1/3 of them or the proceeds thereof would go to the respondents. It
should be noted that labor in the cultivation of fruit trees consists
of—watering the trees, fertilizing them for better, production,
uprooting weeds, turning the soil, fumigating to eliminate plant pests,
etc., (Marcelo <em>vs.</em> De Leon, 105 Phil., 1175). These phases of
labor were furnished by the respondents. It is therefore clear that,
based on the agreement as crystallized in the pleadings and evidence on
record, the petitioner did not perform the labor required of tenant.</p>
  <p>
"Aside from this, the labor in the preparation of the nursery, taking
care of the plants and other incidental phases of labor was furnished
by respondents. The petitioner who pretends to be a tenant, only did
the budding, or the laborers of the respondents did the budding under
the technical supervision of petitioner. In other words, he only
contributed scientific knowledge in budding the citrus plants."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> With the foregoing observation we disagree. There is no question
that the parties have entered into a verbal tenancy agreement the
purpose of which was to operate a citrus nursery upon, the condition
that they would divide the budded citrus in the proportion of 1/3 as
share of respondents and 2/3 as share of petitioner. It was agreed that
petitioner would furnish all the necessary seedlings and seeds, as well
as the technical know-how in the care, cultivation, budding and balling
of the budded citrus, while respondents would furnish the land
necessary for the nursery, the farm labor that may be needed to plant
and cultivate and all the chemicals, fetilizers, and bud tapes that may
be necessary for such cultivation. It would, therefore, appear that the
tenancy agreement entered into between the parties has relation to the
possession of agricultural land to be devoted to the production of
agricultural products thru the labor of one of the parties, and as such
comes within the purview of the term <em>agricultural tenancy</em> as defined in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended.<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup></p>
<p> It appearing that the present controversy involves a relationship
which affects the rights of two litigants over the cultivation and use
of an agricultural land, one of the parties agreeing to furnish the
labor, such controversy comes within the jurisdiction of the Court of
Agrarian Relations, as provided for in Section 7 of Republic Act 1267,
as amended, which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 7. <em>Jurisdiction of the Court</em>—<em>The Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction </em>over
the entire Philippines, to consider, investigate! decide, and settle
all questions, matters, controversies or disputes involving all these
relationships established by law <em>which determine the varying
rights of persons m the cultivation and use of agricultural land where
one of the parties works 'the land: Provided, however,</em> That cases
pending in the Court of Industrial Relations upon approval of this Act
which are within the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations,
shall be transferred to, and the proceedings therein continued in, the
latter court." (Italics supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The agrarian court, therefore, acted not in accordance with law
when it dismissed this case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p> The decision appealed from is reversed. The ease is remanded to the
Court of Agrarian Relations for further proceedings. No costs.</p>
<p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, </em>and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
