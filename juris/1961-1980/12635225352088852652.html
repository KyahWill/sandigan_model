				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Petition for review by <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 37153-R, setting aside the writ
of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, Branch VI, in its Civil Case No. 293.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts of the case as
found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In Civil Case No. 7435 the herein petitioner as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the estate of Luis B. <span class="SpellE">Puentevella</span>
obtained a decision from Branch II, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental rescinding a contract of sale entered
into by Luis B. <span class="SpellE">Puentevella</span> as vendor and Raul <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> as vendee of 36 lots mentioned in the complaint
and declaring that the installments on account of said lots paid by Raul <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> as well as the buildings and other improvements
constructed thereon be considered as rentals for the use and occupation of the
lots, ordering further that the defendants Raul <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>
and Southern <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> College vacate the lots and
deliver possession thereof to the plaintiff.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The decision having become final, a writ of execution was
issued and the Sheriff of Occidental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> placed
the plaintiff in possession of the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the buildings which as stated above were declared to be
the property of the plaintiff for having been considered as part of the rentals
of the lots, the acting Director of the Southern <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
College which was occupying the building, informed the Sheriff that the
President of the School and his wife Mr. and Mrs. Jose Lopez were then in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
implied from the return of the Sheriff that the buildings and the equipment of
the school were not delivered to the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the fact that the decision above referred to
provided for the payment of additional rentals at the rate of P500.00 a month
from February, 1957 until the premises shall have been delivered to the
plaintiff, plus P5,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs, the Sheriff, pursuant
to the same writ of execution, levied upon the books, equipment and supplies
found in the premises and presumably belonging to the defendant Southern <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> College, for the satisfaction of the amounts
mentioned in the decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1965</st1:date>
a certain Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
filed a third-party claim with the Sheriff alleging that he was the owner of
the building and school equipment including the books and supplies, for having
allegedly purchased them from Mr. and Mrs. Jose Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December
 28, </span>1965</st1:date> <span style="">another
third-party claim was </span>filed over the <span style="">same </span>school buildings, equipment, books and supplies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this second third-party claim, the
claimant is <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> De la Cruz who <span style="">like Mr. </span><span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>,
alleges that she acquired the same properties from Mr. and Mrs. Jose Lopez also
by purchase.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On January 3, 1966 <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> De la
Cruz and her husband Miguel De la Cruz filed a complaint before Branch VI of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental and
alleging that they are the owners of the buildings occupied by the Southern <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> College as well as the equipment, books, and
supplies found therein, and that the same were levied upon by the Sheriff to
satisfy a judgment rendered by Branch II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental of which said plaintiffs Mr. and Mrs. De
la Cruz are not parties and, therefore, not binding on them, obtained from the
Presiding Judge of Branch VI of the same court Honorable Carlos <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span> a writ of preliminary injunction ordering Angelina
E. <span class="SpellE">Puentevella</span> and her co-defendants Sheriff and
deputy sheriffs of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
'to refrain from taking possession of the buildings and other properties
mentioned in the depository receipt marked as Exhibit A and the lots wherein
they are situated; and from going on with the sale of the properties; and from
preventing the students, instructors and other personnel of the school from
entering the school premises and to remove the barricades from the main gate of
the school premises, (until further orders) from this court."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due course respondent <span class="SpellE">Puentevella</span>
filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> or <i>mandamus</i> with the Court of
Appeals, with a prayer "that an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> writ of
preliminary injunction be issued enjoining the Hon. Carlos <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span>
from enforcing the writ of preliminary injunction issued by him in Civil Case
No. 293 of the Court <span style="">of First </span>Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental and from further issuing any
other writ or process which would in any manner affect the enforcement of the
judgment rendered by Branch II of the same Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental in Civil Case No. 7435; that, after
hearing, judgment be declared making the writ of preliminary injunction prayed
for in this case permanent." In its decision dated <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1966</st1:date> the Court of Appeals granted the petition
and set aside the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the trial court in
Civil Case No. 293. The spouses De la Cruz moved to reconsider but the motion
was denied in a resolution dated June 27, 1966, the same resolution the Court
of Appeals issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining "respondent
Judge from further enforcing the injunction issued by him in Civil Case No.
293."</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the said decision as well as with the order
denying their motion for reconsideration, the spouses De la Cruz filed the
instant petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion
of petitioners We issued, on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1966</st1:date>, a restraining order to stop the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental from proceeding with the auction sale in
Civil Case No. 7435; and on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="4">April 5,
 1967</st1:date> <span style="">We </span>issued a
writ of preliminary injunction for the same purpose, upon a bond of P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lone issue presented for resolution is whether or not Branch
VI of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental acted with authority in enjoining the Provincial Sheriff from
proceeding with the execution sale of properties levied upon by him pursuant to
a final judgment rendered by Branch II but claimed by the petitioners herein,
the De <span style="">la </span>Cruz spouses, in the
action filed by them <span style="">in </span>the
court which issued the injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision of the Court
of Appeals now sought to be </span>reviewed relies upon <span style="">the case of <span class="SpellE">Hacbang</span> et al. <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">C<span style="">lementino</span></span></span>
<span class="SpellE">Diez</span>, 8 SCRA 103 (May 30, 1963), where this Court
acted and applied the doctrine earlier laid down in <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span>
<i>vs</i>. Del Rosario and Lim, 44 Phil. 192, and subsequently reiterated in
several other cases, that "no court has power to interfere by injunction
with the judgments or decrees of a court of concurrent or coordinate
jurisdiction having equal power to grant the relief sought by injunction <span style="">* * *"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine as thus formulated is well settled, and has been
adhered to consistently whenever justified by the facts in order to avoid
conflict of power between different courts of coordinate jurisdiction and to
bring about a harmonious and smooth functioning of their proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the doctrine to apply, however, the
injunction issued by one court must interfere with the judgment or decree
issued by another court of equal or coordinate jurisdiction, and the relief
sought by such injunction must be one which could be granted by the court which
rendered the judgment or issued the decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no question that the action filed by
the De la Cruz spouses wherein they claim ownership of the properties levied
upon by the provincial sheriff is sanctioned by Section 17 of Rule 39, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"If property levied on be claimed by any other person than the
judgment debtor or his agent, and such person make an affidavit of his title
thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right
or title, and serve the same upon the officer making the levy, and a copy
thereof upon the judgment creditor, the officer shall not be bound to keep the
property, unless such judgment creditor or his agent, on demand of the officer,
indemnify the officer against such claim by a bond in a sum not greater than
the value of the property levied on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be determined by the
Court issuing the writ of execution.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The officer is not liable for damages, for the taking or
keeping of the property, to any third party claimant unless a claim is made by
the latter and unless an action for damages is brought by him against the
officer within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">But nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any third
person from vindicating his claim to the property by any proper action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i><span class="GramE"><span style="">" </span>*</span> * * " (Italics
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may be inferred from the foregoing provision that the right of
a person who claims to be the owner of property levied upon on execution to
file a third-party claim with the sheriff is not exclusive, and that he may
file an action to vindicate his claim even if the judgment creditor files an
indemnity bond in favor of the sheriff to answer for any damages that may be
suffered by the third-party claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
"action," as stated in this Rule, what is meant is a separate and
independent action, such as was resorted to by the third-party claimants in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has been held in Manila
Herald Publishing Co., Inc. <i>vs</i>. Ramos, 88 Phil. 94, where this Court,
through Justice Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, resolved a question
similar to the one now before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
an order of attachment was issued by the Court in a civil suit for libel filed
by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> against the editor, the managing
editor and a reporter of the Daily Record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By virtue of the writ the sheriff levied upon certain properties found
in the premises of the publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Herald Publishing Company, alleging ownership of the properties thus attached,
filed a third-party claim with the sheriff and subsequently an action to enjoin
the attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action fell to
another branch of the Court of First Instance, which issued the preliminary
injunction against the sheriff.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court said, in
relation to the point which is of relevance here:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The objection that at once suggests itself to entertaining in
Case No. 12263 the motion to discharge the preliminary attachment levied in
Case No 115391 is that by so doing one judge would interfere with another
judge's actuations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objection is
superficial and will not bear analysis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been seen that a separate action by the third party who
claims to be the owner of the property attached is <span style="">appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>If this is
so, it must be admitted that the judge trying such action may render judgment
ordering the sheriff or whoever has in possession the attached property to
deliver it to the plaintiff-claimant or desist from seizing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows further that the court may make an
interlocutory order, upon the filing of such bond as may be necessary, to
release the property pending final adjudication of the title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction over an action includes
jurisdiction over an interlocutory matter incidental to the cause and deemed
necessary to preserve the subject matter of the suit or protect the parties'
interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is self-evident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fault with the respondents' argument is that it assumes that
the Sheriff is holding the property in question by order of the court handling
the case for libel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reality this is
true only to a limited extent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
court did not direct the Sheriff to attach the particular property in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order was for the Sheriff to attach <span class="SpellE">Borres</span>', Padilla's and Pastor's property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not supposed to touch any property
other than that of these defendants', and if he did, he acted beyond the limits
of his authority and upon his personal responsibility.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is true of course that property in custody of the law can not be
interfered with without the permission of the proper court, and property
legally attached is property in <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">custodia</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">legis</span></i></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>But for the reason just
stated, this rule is confined to cases where the property belongs to the
defendant or one in which the defendant has proprietary interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Sheriff acting beyond the bounds of
his office seizes a stranger's property, the rule does not apply and
interference with his custody is not interference with another court's order of
attachment.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It may be <span style="">argued </span>that
the third-party claim may be unfounded; but so may it be meritorious, for that
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Speculations are however beside
the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The title is the very issue <span style="">in </span>the case for the recovery of
property or the dissolution of the attachment, and pending final decision, the
court may enter any interlocutory order calculated to preserve the property in
litigation and protect the parties' rights and interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rationale of the decision in the Herald Publishing Company <span style="">case </span>is peculiarly applicable to the
one before Us, and removes it from the general doctrine enunciated in the
decisions cited by the respondents and quoted earlier herein.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Under Section 17 of Rule 39 a third person who
claims property levied upon on execution may vindicate such claim by action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously a judgment rendered in his favor,
that is, declaring him to be the owner of the property, would not constitute
interference with the powers or processes of the court which rendered the
judgment to enforce which the <span style="">execution
was </span>levied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that be so – and
it is so because the property, being that of a stranger, is not subject to levy
– then an interlocutory order such as injunction, upon a claim and prima facie
showing of ownership by the claimant, cannot be considered as such interference
either.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->To adopt the statement <span style="">in </span>the Herald Publishing Company decision and apply it here,
Branch II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, in Case No. 7435, did not direct the sheriff to levy upon the
particular properties in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
order was for him to levy upon properties of the judgment debtor, without
specifying them.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The issue presented by herein private
respondents in Civil Case No. 293 before respondent Judge was one of ownership,
which could not have been presented <span style="">to and </span>resolved by the other court in Civil
Case No. 7435.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In other </span>words, that court could not
grant the <span style="">relief
sought by the </span>injunction, and consequently neither its judgment nor the
enforcement thereof was interfered with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Execution could still proceed with respect to the judgment debtor's
properties.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The case of <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> <i>vs</i>.
Del Rosario and Lim, supra, is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that case a writ of execution was issued by one court (second branch,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>) to enforce its judgment for
a sum of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the defendant's
property was levied upon he filed a petition in another court (first branch),
praying that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued to restrain the sheriff
from carrying out the execution on the ground that there was another action
pending between the same parties in the Supreme Court and in which action the
defendant had been given a judgment by the Court of First Instance for a much
larger amount than that for which the execution was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these facts, it is quite clear that the
preliminary injunction issued by Branch I was improper, and constituted undue
interference with a decree of Branch II, where the same relief could have been
sought.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> against the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> Autobus Co., Inc. in Civil Case No. 2045.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of execution was issued, and a
passenger bus was levied upon by the provincial sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
Autobus Co., Inc., claiming that it was the owner of the bus and that it was
not the defendant in Civil Case No. 2045, although it bore the same name, filed
a third-party claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> court <i style=""><span style="">denied the </span></i><i style=""><span style="">claim
and directed that the sale of the bus be carried out</span></i><span style="">, </span>on the
ground that the said respondent was the very same company that was the
defendant against whom the judgment had been rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently the respondent filed another
action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
reproducing substantially the allegations in its third-party claim, and prayed
that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued to restrain the sale of the
passenger bus which had been levied upon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The injunction was issued as prayed for and the sheriff came to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, through Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
now Chief Justice, granted the petition and annulled the said writ, applying
the doctrine laid down in <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> <i>vs</i>. Del
Rosario, <i style=""><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">, </span>and citing in its decision still another case, namely,
National Power Corporation <i>vs</i>. Hon. Jesus de <span class="SpellE">Veyra</span>,
3 SCRA 646 (Dec. 22, 1961).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that in the <span class="SpellE">Hacbang</span> case
the injunction issued by the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> court constituted
an interference with the processes of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
court, since the latter had already denied the third-party claim filed before
it by the respondent company, held that the latter was the very defendant
against whom judgment has been rendered, and directed the sale of the specific
property claimed by it.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. The National Power Corporation case presented a more or less
similar situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the
decision penned by Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, "the
question raised is whether or not property which has been levied upon in a
garnishment proceeding by one court (in Manila) may be subject to the
jurisdiction of another court (in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>) in an
independent suit impugning the legality of said garnishment – the property
garnished allegedly being exempt from execution." This Court held:
"The reason advanced by the respondent court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City that it should grant relief when 'there is apparently an <i style=""><span style="">illegal
</span></i><i style=""><span style="">service</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the writ' </span>*
* * may not be upheld, there being a better procedure to follow, i.e., a resort
to the Manila Court, wherein the remedy may be obtained, it being the court
under whose authority the illegal levy had been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, an effective ordering of
legal relationships in civil society is possible only when each court is
granted exclusive jurisdiction over the property brought to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow coordinate courts to interfere with
each other's judgments or decrees by injunction would obviously lead to
confusion and might seriously hinder the proper administration of
justice."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As may be noted, the statement of the doctrine relied upon by the
respondents in the present case must be taken <span style="">in </span>context, that is, in the particular factual setting wherein <span style="">it is </span>applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of this case do not lend themselves
to <span style="">its </span>application.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. Respondents assail the injunction issued by Judge Carlos <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span> on the ground that, irrespective of the question as
to his authority, the facts and circumstances of the case do not justify its
issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is, however, a factual
matter which we cannot here review, involving as it does evidence adduced
before the trial court, and which should have been, if at all, raised in the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is
reversed and set aside, and the authority of respondent Judge Carlos <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span> to issue the writ of preliminary injunction which he
did in Civil Case No. 293 is upheld, without prejudice to whatever further
action he may take in respect thereof, as may be justified by the facts and
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur, but I would like to state a few considerations relative
to the points taken up in the main opinion which I believe need to be
emphasized.</p>

<p class="BODY">In my view, which is not necessarily shared by all my colleagues,
by adopting and reiterating in this case the doctrine laid down in Manila
Herald Publishing Co., Inc. vs. Ramos, 88. Phil. 94, the Court is once more
making it clear that in implementing a writ of attachment or execution issued
by a Court of First Instance, the sheriff must see to it that only properties
unquestionably belonging to the attachment defendant or judgment debtor against
whom the writ is issued are levied upon and that should there be any
controversy as to the ownership of said properties, such controversy may be
submitted for resolution not necessarily to the court issuing the writ involved
but to any other Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe it is necessary to make this point very clear because at first
blush, one would feel that inasmuch as the property the ownership of which is
being disputed is the subject of an order of a particular court for the seizing
thereof to the end that it may be used to satisfy a judgment already rendered
or to be rendered by it, it would seem that the more logical rule should be to
confine the jurisdiction of such a controversy in the same court, as a
necessary consequence of its authority and power to make effective its
judgment, since otherwise it would be the easiest thing for a defendant or a
judgment debtor to nullify the recognition by the court of the validity of the
grounds of attachment of the plaintiff or the cause of action of the judgment
creditor by simply asking or allowing some friendly third party to file a claim
of ownership over his properties and thereby oust the jurisdiction of the court
over the writ issued in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, there seems to be logic in the proposition that in order to
preserve the subject matter of the suit, the court issuing the writ should be
the one to decide any claim of any third party over the property being subject
by it to its ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, there is the consideration that the taking up of such claim would have
nothing to do with the merits of the cause of action in the litigation before
the court and could unnecessarily delay its complete termination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I for one am convinced that as between these
two considerations, the latter is more weighty, particularly, because as
indicated by Mr. Justice Tuason in the Manila Herald Publishing case, it is clearly
inferable from the provisions of the Rules of Court on third party claims, both
under Rule 39 (section 17) and Rule 57 (section 14), that the "proper
action" referred to in both sections, by which the third party may
vindicate his claim to the property, is more appropriately an independent
action instead of a mere intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, I feel it is opportune in this case to invite
attention to a matter of practice that has caused complications and
multiplicity of suits with the correspon­ding delay in the adjudication of the
merits of cases brought to the court, which ought not to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I refer to the particular circumstance in
this case of the action of petitioner Miguel de la Cruz and Jovita de la Cruz
being assigned to Branch VI of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental
when the parties knew all the time and could have easily informed the court
that the main case had been decided by Branch II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If proper arrangements were only made by
Courts of First Instance having several branches in the same province such that
related cases may fall only in the same branch, cases similar to the present
one would not arise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is about time
that the attention of judges of the Courts of First Instance and of
practitioners were called to this matter so that proper remedies may be sought
and applied to this situation which has been the root cause of considerable
delay in the administration of justice.</p>
