Asuncion Cruz, et al., defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>"

<p class="BODY">On April 22, 1964, the spouses Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> Santos filed a complaint against
Asuncion Cruz, widow of the deceased Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> and
their children Alberto, Cesar, Angel, <span class="SpellE">Roman,and</span>
Marina, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, for the recovery of
possession of a parcel of residential land with an area of 1,637 sq. meters,
located in <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> originally covered by Tax Declaration No. 388
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>,
assessed at P830.00, bounded on the north by Juan <span class="SpellE">Maniego</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Santos; south by provincial road; east by
<span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> Santos and west by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint averred that plaintiff Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
inherited the property by virtue of inheritance from her parents, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> and Angelina <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, both deceased; "that sometime in the later part
of 1952, plaintiff had agreed with Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> that
the latter could build a house on the above-described property and to pay the
corresponding tax of said property and allow her to live with the family of
Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> in the house without any other obligation;
they further agreed that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> could build, as
he did, <span class="SpellE">accessorias</span> on the property and for her to
share in the rentals which rentals she had been sharing per their agreement at
P50.00 per month since 1958 up to May 1961 (par. 5);"</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint further alleged that after the death of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> on June 19, 1961, Asuncion Cruz, surviving widow of
Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, began refusing to share the rentals with
the plaintiffs insisting that the land above-described belongs to them because
it was sold by plaintiffs' father, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> to her husband, Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
which is not true and that despite demands for said rentals and for the return
of possession of the property, defendants refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs pray for the payment of rent <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P1,750.00 plus subsequent rentals that may accrue
with legal interest, the return of the property and damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, defendants (now the petitioners) denied
the material averments alleged, claiming as special defense that their
predecessor-in-interest Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, deceased husband
of Asuncion and father of the other defendants, acquired the land from his
mother Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and upon the death of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, defendants acquired the same by operation of law;
they further claimed that they have been in actual possession of the land by
themselves and thru their predecessors-in-interest publicly, openly,
peacefully, continuously, under a claim of title and in the concept of owner
exclusively and adversely against the whole world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also set up a counterclaim by way of
attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They prayed for the dismissal of the complaint; that they be declared
owners of the land and awarded moral damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the pre-trial, the following were admitted by the
parties:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"that previously the land
in question was declared for taxation purposes in the name of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>, father of
plaintiff Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> died on September 18, 1917; that the only heir
of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> is
plaintiff Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>; that the said tax
declaration in the name of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> was cancelled and transferred in the name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> on May 29, 1953 and after his death in the names of
his heirs, defendants herein; that defendants have been and are in possession
of the property in question having buildings for residential purposes and for
rent; that defendants have consistently paid the corresponding taxes."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the
defendants and against the plaintiffs:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Declaring
the defendants the real owners of the land described in the complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering
the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants damages by way of attorney's fees in
the amount of P1,000.00 and the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals by the plaintiffs, the decision
of the trial court was reversed and the respondent court ordered the return of
the property to the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Arceos</span>, payment
of back rentals due them covering the period from June, 1961 at the rate of
P50.00 a month with legal interest until the premises are vacated and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a motion for reconsideration, the same was denied although
the appellate court specifically made the finding that the possession of the
petitioners "became adverse to plaintiffs' rights in 1953, after the Civil
Code had taken effect." Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of petitioners' brief is the grave error of the
respondent court in the gross <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span> and
misapprehension of facts that have been admitted and stipulated by the parties,
and established on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioners.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The principal bone of contention
between the parties is the nature and concept of petitioners' possession of the
premises, which the private respondents admit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the private respondents as alleged in their complaint, par.
5, sometime in the later part of 1952, Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
had agreed with Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> that the latter could
build a house on the property and to pay the corresponding tax thereon and
allow her to live with the family of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> in
the house without any other obligation and they further agreed that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> could build, as he did <span class="SpellE">accesorias</span>
on the property and for her to share in the rentals at P50.00 per month since
1958 up to May, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted by
Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> that the alleged lease agreement was
entered into orally, there being no document executed between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., </span><st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="10">Oct. 8, 1968</st1:date>, pp. 4-5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, private respondents contend that
petitioners' possession was pursuant to such oral lease agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners vigorously deny the existence of the alleged oral
lease agreement and they maintain that their possession and occupancy was in
concept of owner under a claim of ownership from their predecessor-in-interest
Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> by operation of law, the latter in turn
inheriting the same from his deceased mother, Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the vital issue emerges as to whether
such oral lease was really entered into between the parties and upon which the
nature and concept of petitioners' <span class="SpellE">possesion</span> may be
determined and resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, the trial court in disbelieving and rejecting the
alleged oral lease said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is amusing to note that Exhibits 1, 1-A to 1-C are tax
receipts for the years 1947 to 1950 paid by the defendants'
predecessors-in-interest on the land in question, while plaintiffs claim that
the alleged agreement with Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> started only in
the earlier part of 1952 and he (Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>) started
paying the rental from 1958 up to 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These tax receipts belie the pretension that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
paid the taxes on the house and lot in question because of the said alleged
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 2 is the receipt for
the house erected therein in the name of Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and is dated <st1:date year="1948" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1948</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the respondent court without squarely deciding the
issue, impliedly upheld the oral lease agreement by ordering petitioners to pay
back rentals and subsequent rentals at P50.00 a month with interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the facts established on record,
We hold that the finding of the appellate court is not supported by substantial
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court that Exhibits 1, 1-A to 1-C which
are tax receipts for the years 1947 to 1950 paid by petitioners'
predecessors-in-interest on the property in dispute clearly overthrow the
contention of the private respondents that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
agreed to pay the taxes by reason of the alleged oral lease agreement which was
supposedly made in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is highly
impro­bable, if not incredible that a lessee would pay taxes due for five years
on the leased premises before he actually begins occupancy of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records also disclose proceedings during the pre-trial of the
case wherein counsel of the private respondents admitted the possession of the
land in question by the petitioners to have started in 1938 when Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> married and she went out of the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And immediately thereafter, the Court
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In this connection, the
plaintiff admits that it was only in 1938 that the defendant possessed the
property, only in 1938 when said plaintiff left the premises and married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants however contend that they
possessed the property even prior to 1927."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This admission by respondents' counsel further repudiates and conflicts with
the claim of Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> that petitioners'
possession and occupancy of the premises was by virtue of the oral lease
agreement made in the later part of 1952.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents are bound by their counsel's admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioners were admittedly already in
possession of the property in 1938, it may be reasonably inferred that they
possessed and occupied the property not by virtue of the alleged oral lease
agreement executed in 1952.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also find that the testimony of Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
that in 1952 she delivered the lot in question to Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
under a lease agreement of P50.00 a month is not corroborated nor supported by
any document, writing, some note or memorandum thereof subscribed by Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, the alleged lessee, or by his agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is absolutely no showing or explanation
whatsoever why no receipt, writing, note or memorandum of the lease agreement
exists or is available notwithstanding the fact as she claims that the lease
had been in force from 1952 to 1961 during which time Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
is alleged to have religiously paid the monthly rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is
unable to produce receipts of the rents paid during a period of ten years or
even a single receipt for a month or some document, writing, note or memorandum
of the lease and does not even explain his failure thereof, the claim of
private respondents that there was such a lease of the property is rendered
beyond belief, contrary to human experience and practice and the usual course
of things.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records further disclose that petitioners' counsel, at the
trial of the case, objected to the introduction of <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence to prove the oral lease agreement which the trial court sustained.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, there being no <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence to prove the
oral lease agreement, the ruling of the appellate court upholding the lease
agreement was without legal or factual basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold that there is no competent proof of such oral lease.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The Court of Appeals, in reversing
the judgment of the trial court, relied mainly on what the former called the
"(s)<span class="SpellE">ilent</span> and eloquent proof of plaintiffs'
ownership of the land in dispute (which) is the expressed recognition of Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> of Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo's</span> property right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this is best illustrated when Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
consented to the annotation in her tax declaration No. 5775 that her house was
"Erected on the Solar of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> Tax No. 388" (Exhibit 1-C).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the respondent court for there is no
scintilla of evidence that Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> consented to
the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> annotation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had long died when the case was filed, so
was Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, her only son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also no proof when such annotation
was made and by whom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time Tax
Declaration No. 5775 was constituted by Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
on February 13, 1948, the land itself bore Tax Declaration No. 388, hence, it
was merely <span class="SpellE">routinary</span> on the part of the assessor to
indicate the tax declaration number of the land on which the house was erected
without Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> participation much less consent
thereto, otherwise her initial or signature to such annotation would have
appeared below the annotation, which We find none in Exhibit C.</p>

Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
had already died, the resolution of this controversy may be sought on the basis
of who had been paying the taxes on the land in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> had been paying the taxes on the property as shown in
Exhibit 1 (tax receipt for 1947), Exhibit 1-A (tax receipt for 1948), Exhibit
1-b (tax receipt for 1949), Exhibit 1-C (tax receipt for 1950); that peti­tioners
paid the taxes for the years 1961 (Exhibit 1-d) and 1962 (Exhibit 1-E).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tax payments for 1944 and previous years were
not available on account of the war and those from 1945 to 1947 were destroyed
by white ants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit I).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, on the other hand, have not paid any tax on
the property in litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court of Appeals, however, held that although Juan
<span class="SpellE">Andan</span> paid the taxes, the tax receipts indicated that
the name of the declared owner of the land was E. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
was merely the <span class="SpellE">payor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We reject this conclusion of the appellate court not only because it is
weak, flimsy and unrealistic, but also because it is not justified and
warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examining the tax receipt for
the year 1947 (Exhibit 1), it appears thereon that the declared owners of the
lot for which the taxes were paid were "J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,"
"do"(or "J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>"),
"do" (or"J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>"),"do"
(or "J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>"), "E. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>," and "A. <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>."
For the year 1948 (Exhibit 1-a), the declared owners of the lots paid for were
"J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>," "do" (or "J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>"), "do" (or "J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>"),"do" (or"J. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>")
and "E. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>." For the year 1949 the
declared owners of the lots paid for were the same as for the year 1948 and the
same is true with respect to the tax receipt for the year 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant that not one of these
properties was in the name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, but
considering that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> was the only son and heir
of Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
and, therefore, a claimant to these pro­perties of Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and Angel <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, there is strong and substantial
reason to conclude that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> paid the taxes for
all these properties including that under the name of E. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
under a claim of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
fair to conclude that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> was merely a <span class="SpellE">payor</span> from the fact of payment of one lot without taking
into consideration the other lots whose taxes were paid at the same time as
well as similar payments for the lots for the succeeding years up to 1950,
including other relevant circumstances of time, persons and relationship.</p>

covering the land in the name of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> to Tax Declaration No. 7574 in his (Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>) name.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Disputing this ruling of the Court of Appeals, petitioners claim
that they have acquired ownership over the land thru their possession which had
been shown to be actual, peaceful, open, public, continuous and under a claim
of title, adverse against the whole world since the complaint was filed only in
1964 or after eleven (11) years from 1953.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners further contend that their possession and occupation of the
premises date back to the year 1938, which the parties have stipulated and
agreed at the pre-trial hearing of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention of the petitioners is impressed with truth and
merit as the same is borne out by the records and the transcript thereof which
We have previously discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We,
therefore, find that the ruling of the respondent court dating petitioners'
adverse possession to the year 1953 is contrary to the admission of the private
respondents thru counsel, and since petitioners' possession of the property in
question commenced way back in 1938 which was at the time the old Civil Code
was still in force, the prescriptive period is governed under Section 41 of the
Code of Civil Procedure because Article 1116 of the New Civil Code provides
that "Prescription already running before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Code (August 30, 1950) shall be governed by laws previously in
force." Section 41 of the C. C. P. states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Title to land
by prescription.- Ten years of actual adverse possession by any person claiming
to be the owner for that time of any land or interest in land, uninterruptedly,
continuously for ten years by occupancy, descent, grants of otherwise, in
whatever way such occupancy may have commenced or continued, shall vest in
every actual possessor of such land a full complete title, saving to the person
under disabilities the rights, secured by the next section."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the evidence for petitioners clear, competent and
substantial establishing that they have exercised acts of dominion in
derogation of respondents' interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They have constructed permanent buildings thereon and collected the
rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Permission was sought and
obtained from them when another building for a drug store and later when
enlarged to include a bakery, were built by other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They collected the fruits of fruit bearing
trees planted on the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Questions of
boundaries between adjoining properties were consulted with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These acts of dominion were not rebutted by
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And most importantly
petitioners have paid religiously the taxes on the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the part of private respondents, their evidence appear
inconsequential, inherently weak and unsatisfactory for it would appear
unnatural for respondent Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> to abandon
the lot when in 1938 she married her co-respondent <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>
Santos and built their conjugal home some seven houses away and later
transferred to a house and lot purchased and constructed by her in-laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her claim that in 1952 she entered into the
lease agreement with Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> on condition, among
others, that she will be allowed to live free in the house built by Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> appears to be doubtful and dubious, considering that,
as may be gleaned from the testimony of Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>,
she never lived in said house and there is no showing that she attempted to
live there or that she complained or protested to Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
for not complying with this term of the lease agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the trial court made the correct observation
that:</p>

<blockquote>"When Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> was placed in
the stand for the first time, she was positive on cross-examination that she
nor anyone did not make any claim for war damage for the house erected on the
land in question which was burned down during the Japanese occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, after defendants had introduced
Exhibits 4, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C and 4-D, documents relating to the war damage claim
and award to Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> on said house she reversed
and contradicted herself as a rebuttal witness and stated that she was given
the sum of P300.00 by Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, because she (Julia
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>) was the one who had said house repaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the plaintiffs were the real owners of the
land in question, why did they not file the war damage claim? If it is true
that the land in question belongs to the plaintiffs, why did they not build
their house on the said land when they separated from her in-laws and instead
built their house on some other's property not theirs?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
not make an assertion of her alleged rights until Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> had died and death had sealed their
lips?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>,
admittedly a relative of plaintiff Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>,
was presented to bolster the claim of the existence of the agreement between
Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> and said plaintiff over payment of rent on
the land in question, by testifying that on several occasions Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> had sent through him P50.00 to Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
cross-examination, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
admitted that the distance between his house and the house of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> and the distance of the house of said Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> from that of Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>
were almost the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> had to go almost the same distance from the house to
Catalina's and from his house to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro's</span>, why would
he have bothered to go to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro's</span> and not directly
to Catalina's?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be stated here that the house which burned down during
the Japanese occupation was the house of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> according to <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
Santos, witness for the private respondents (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
August 15, 1968, p. 15), but the fact established is that the war damage claim
for said house was claimed by and paid to Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
mother of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>, which fact militates against
private respondents' claim that they owned the house and the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court laid stress on the affidavit of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> (Exhibit E), claiming purchase of the lot in question
from <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>, and
the court declared it was utterly improbable for Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>
to have bought the land because he was only ten years old when <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> died in
1917.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conceding that Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> was then a minor, minority is only one of the
limitations on the capacity to act and do not exempt the incapacitated person
from certain obligations, as when the latter arise from his acts or from
property relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 161 of
the old Civil Code, whatever the child may acquire with the capital or property
of the parents belongs to the latter in ownership and in usufruct, which is
also the same provision in Article 324 of the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the circumstances of the
sale under which Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> as a minor acquired the
property with the capital of his mother, Julia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
are not improbable under the law aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances may not be sufficiently
clear or explained since the affiant Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> had
long passed away in 1961 and can no longer be confronted <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
whereas private respondents chose conveniently to file their complaint against
the heirs of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> in 1964 or 3 years
thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisprudence, however, is overwhelming and well-established in
support of petitioners' claim of title acquired through acquisitive
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Ongsiaco</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dallo</span></u>, 27 SCRA 161, the Supreme Court said:
"Under the Code of Civil Procedure formerly in force, good or bad faith
was immaterial for purposes of acquisitive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adverse possession in either character
ripened into ownership after the lapse of ten years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, an action to recover
title to or possession of immovable property prescribed in the same
period." In <span class="SpellE"><u>Narag</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span></u>, 48 SCRA 11, the Supreme Court traced the
pronouncements and rulings of the Supreme Court dating as far back as 1908 in
the case of <u>Altman vs. Commanding Officer</u>, 11 Phil. 516, to the case of <span class="SpellE">Ongsiaco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dallo</span>, <u>supra</u>,
concerning the ten-year period required by Sec. 41 of the Code of Civil
Procedure that it suffices that there be a claim as "owner for that time
of a piece of land [to vest] in him the full and complete title thereto,"
the Court speaking thru Justice Willard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Narag</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span></u> case, continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The same form of words was repeated by
Justice Trent for the Court in <span class="SpellE">Corporacion</span> de PP. <span class="SpellE">Agustinos</span> <span class="SpellE">Recoletos</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, 32 Phil. 427 (1915).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'With real property however, it is different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 40 bars the owner's remedy after ten
years, and Section 41 vests in the adverse possessor after the same period of
time "a full and complete title."' Two years later, in 1917, came
this reaffirmation of such a view from Justice Torres: "Taking into
consideration that the applicant, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span> <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, is now and has been for twenty years, in possession
of the same property, counting that of his predecessors, it may be said that
beyond a shadow of a doubt that the <span class="SpellE">owership</span> in the
said strip of land has prescribed, pursuant to the provisions of section 41 of
Act No. 190, since the possession of the applicant has been actual, open,
public, and continuous, under a claim of title exclusive of any other right and
adverse to all other claimants, ***' Nor is there any need for a just
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Street made such a
point-clear as early as 1921 in <u>Santos v. Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span></u>,
41 Phil. 342.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Our opinion upon this point is that adverse
possession must be taken to have begun with occupancy and supposing that
occupancy of the usurped property began, as the trial court evidently believed,
with the execution of the contract of sale ***, or soon thereafter, it results
that the petitioners had acquired title by ten years' adverse possession, under
section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, prior to the beginning of these
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
x' As a matter of fact, Justice Laurel, in <span class="SpellE">Labot</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Librada</span>, 72 Phil. 433 (1941), in sustaining a plea that a
party was entitled to the benefits of this provision of law, stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘To constitute exclusive possession, it is
not necessary to exclude every one from all entry on the land, and the fact
that another person uses the property concurrently with the claimants by the
permission of the latter or in subordination to their claim, does not, in a
legal sense, militate against the exclusiveness of their possession.’ Moreover,
in a 1950 decision, <span class="SpellE">Arboso</span> v. Andrade, 87 Phil. 782,
Justice Bautista Angelo, for this Court, reiterated the view that the presence
of good faith, inferentially by just title, is immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As was so categorically announced by Justice J.B.L.
Reyes: ‘Prescription lies under the said section even in the absence of good
faith and just title.' (<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Reas</span>,
L-28337, September 30, 1970, 35 SCRA 210, 214).</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the good faith and just title of Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span> in the case at bar, is immaterial for prescription
lies under Section 41, C.C.P.</p>

<p class="BODY">To recapitulate, We have ruled herein that petitioners’
possession and occupancy of the property commenced in 1938 when Catalina <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> got married and abandoned the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have also rejected as inexistent and
spurious the alleged oral lease agreement entered into in 1952 between Catalina
<span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> and Juan <span class="SpellE">Andan</span>,
petitioners’ predecessor-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
also find as established the claim of petitioners that they have acquired

1938.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever right private respondents had to the property had
already prescribed by the mere lapse of time by reason of negligence,
carelessness and abandon­ment and their cause of action is barred or can no
longer prosper after more than twenty-six (26) years, that is, from 1938 when
the cause of action accrued, to 1964 when the complaint was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The laws aid the vigilant, not those who

<p class="BODY">It is appropriate to stress here the essence of the statute of
limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Conspecto</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Fruto</span></u>, 31 Phil. 144, 151, the Supreme Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>''It is the essence of the statute of limitations that, whether the
party had a right to the possession or not, if he entered under the claim of such
right and remained in possession for the period (ten years) named in the
statute of limitations, the right of action of the plaintiff who had the better
title is barred by that adverse possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right given by the statute of limitations does not depend upon, and
has no necessary connection with, the validity of the claim under which the
possession is held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise there
could be no use for the statute of limitations or adverse possession as a
defense to an action, for if the decision is made to depend upon the validity
of the respective titles set up by the plaintiff and the defendant, there can
be no place for the consideration of the question of adverse possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is because the plaintiff has a better
title that the defendant is permitted to rely upon such uninterrupted
possession, adverse to the plaintiff’s title, as the statute prescribes, it
being well understood and an element in such cases, that the plaintiff does
have the better title, but that he has lost it by delay in asserting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Probst</span> vs.
Presbyterian Church, 129 U.S., 182).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Neither is it necessary that the defendant should have a proper
title, under which he claims possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is sufficient, if he asserts ownership of the land, and that this
assertion is accompanied by an uninterrupted possession for the period named in
the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this which
constitutes adverse possession--claiming himself to be the owner of the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the one in possession asserts
his right to own the land in dispute, asserts his right to the possession, and
his possession has been adverse and uninterrupted, it constitutes a bar which
the statute intended to give him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ewing
vs. Burnet, 11 Peters [U.S.], 39, 52; Harvey vs. Tyler, 2 Wallace [U.S<span style="font-size: 12pt;">]</span>, 328, 349; Coke's
Institutes; First Part, 153).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Sections 40 of Act No. 190 is plain and unambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It plainly says:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"An action for the recovery of title to,
or possession of, real property, or an interest therein, can only be brought
within ten years after the cause of such action accrues." In the present
case, the action for the recovery of the possession of the real property in
question was not brought within ten years after the cause of action had
accrued." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since private respondents abandoned the property in question in
1938 and petitioners and their predecessors-in-interest took possession of the
land from that time and have remained therein up to the present, the action to
recover possession has clearly lapsed, firstly, in the light of Section 40, Act
190 quoted above which is applicable hereto since the possession of the
predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners commenced before the New Civil Code
took effect and thus, Article 1116 of the New Civil Code governs, as previously
elucidated. (Development Bank of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Ozarraga</span>,
14 SCRA 653).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the C.C.P., an
action for recovery of title to, or possession of, real property, or an
interest therein, can only be brought within ten years after the cause of
action accrues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.

<p class="BODY">And secondly, whether We consider the complaint of private
respondents to recover possession of the property in question as an <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></u>
or <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">reivindicatoria</span></u>,
the same has prescribed after the lapse of ten years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After private respondents had aban­doned for
26 years the property which is unregistered land, the law as well as justice
and equity will not allow them "to lie in wait and spring as in an

made and constructed residences, buildings and other valuable improvements
thereon, and enjoying the fruits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Parcotilo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Parcotilo</span>, 12 SCRA 435; <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>
