<p class="BODY">Respondent Manuel B. Casaclang, a member of the <span style="">Bar, </span>is charged by Maxima C. Lopez
with malpractice on three <span style="">counts, </span>namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) for having improperly notarized a
document <span style="">purport­ing </span>to be a
deed of transfer of <span style="">rights over </span><span style="">a piece </span>of <span style="">land </span>by
<span style="">complainant in favor </span>of Demetria
B. Casaclang, respondent's mother, in the absence of the person executing said <span style="">document and of </span>the two witnesses,
contrary to what is recited <span style="">in the </span>acknowledgment;
(2) for <span style="">having notarized a falsified </span>general
power of attorney; and (3) for having prepared an affidavit <span style="">and </span>t<span style="">aken the verification of the affiants, knowing the con</span>tents
thereof to be false.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our resolution of <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1962</st1:date> we referred the case to the Solicitor-General for
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He submitted his report
on <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1968</st1:date>,
recommending dismissal <span style="">of the charges,
but with an admonition to respondent to </span><span style="">be </span>more careful in the performance of
his notarial duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first count it appears that in 1957 <span style="">com­plainant, then </span>a
public school teacher in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">,</span> applied for the right to purchase a 460 square-meter lot
from the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her application was approved in 1958,
whereupon she made a down payment of P460.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In June <span style="">of
</span>that year, according to her testimony at the investigation, she was
transferred to Binmaley, Pang­<span style="">asinan, </span>where respondent's father, Pedro Casaclang,
was Dis­trict Supervisor and therefore her superior in the service.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The latter's wife became interested in the
lot and asked complainant to transfer it to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She refused in the beginning, but later on
the two of them went to the PHHC office to inquire as to the feasibility of
such transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PHHC manager advised
her against it, and the next thing she knew was that <span style="">sometime in </span>the early part of 1962 her
rights to the land had been transferred to respondent's parents by <span style="">virtue of a deed to
</span>that effect prepared by said respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said she did not remember having signed the document, but was
positive that she and the two witnesses thereto did not sign it before
respondent as notary public, although <span style="">on cross-examination she admitted </span>that her
signature seemed or looked genuine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
their part the witnesses - Marceline L. Delgado <span class="GramE">and</span>
Emilia J. Lopez - testified in the same vein, that is, although the signatures
were theirs they <span style="">did not appear before respondent for the signing and notarial acknowledgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent's
testimony </span>is that when his mother and complainant went to the PHHC
office in connection with <span style="">the intended </span>transfer of rights, they were <span style="">advised </span>to go back to Pangasinan to
have the corresponding document signed by respondent's father as one of the <span style="">transferees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The parties <span style="">then applied to have respondent prepare it,
which he did, </span>after which he explained its contents to the parties -
complainant <span style="">and
respondent's </span>parents - who thereupon signed the same, together with the
witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">genuineness </span>of the signatures is not seriously in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in the preliminary <span style="">investigation </span>of
the charge of falsification (of the same <span style="">document) filed by complainant against respondent
and his father before the </span>Assistant Fiscal in Lingayen, Pangasinan, her
signature as well as the signatures of the two witnesses were categorically
admitted by them to be genuine, <span style="">although they denied </span>having <span style="">signed in
respondent's presence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">Solicitor-General is </span>of the opinion that upon <span style="">the evidence of
record respondent's version is more deserving of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see </span>no reason to <span style="">disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, </span>it has been held that mere
preponderance of <span style="">evidence is </span>not sufficient to overcome the import of the
certification by a notary that the grantor in a document acknowledged the fact
of <span style="">its
execution </span>before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Robinson v. <span style="">Villafuerte, 18 Phil. 171; Jocson </span>v. Estacion, G. R. No.</span>
L-41867, <st1:date year="1935" day="22" month="7">July <span style="">22, 1935</span></st1:date><span style="">.) To accomplish </span>this
result the evidence to the contrary <span style="">must be clear, </span>strong and convincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, considering that <span style="">the </span>signatures <span style="">on </span>the document in question are genuine, even if <span style="">respondent </span>did
notarize the same in complainant's absence the <span style="">irregularity is not serious </span>enough to
warrant disbarment or <span style="">suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It merely
suggests lack<span style=""> </span><span style="">of </span>caution, not culpable <span style="">malpractice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">(Ramirez <span style="">v. Ner, Ad.</span></span><span style=""> Case No. 500,</span><span style=""> </span><st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="9">Sept. 27, 1967</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Nor </span>does the fact that respondent's mother
was a party <span style="">make
his act any more </span>blameworthy, the transaction being above board and <span style="">untainted </span>with
fraud or trickery.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second count respondent <span style="">is charged with having notarized a falsified
general power of attorney purportedly executed </span>by one Teofila S.
Banigued, <span style="">authorizing
respondent's </span>father to follow up her application <span style="">for certain benefits </span>due her deceased
husband from the mutual <span style="">aid system of the Philippine Public School Teachers' Association.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the evidence, and so found by the
Solicitor-General, that the signature <span style="">purporting
</span>to be that of Teofila S. Banigued had <span style="">been written, with her </span>consent, by her aunt-in-law, <span style="">Alejandra Banigued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Respond­</span><span style="">ent's </span>narration of events <span style="">is
</span>as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Teofila <span style="">S. Banigued and </span>her family were his
clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One <span style="">day Alejandra and San­</span><span style="">tiago Banigued, complainant's brother-in-law, came
to his </span>office and requested him, <span style="">in the </span>name of <span style="">Teofila who could not then come because she
was ill, to prepare the power </span><span style="">of </span>attorney in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He prepared </span>a draft and <span style="">gave it </span>to
them unsigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently he dropped <span style="">at Teofila's place
on </span>his way to Dagupan and inquired about <span style="">the document </span>he had <span style="">drafted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Teofila sent for her sister-in-law
Alejandra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When </span>the latter
arrived she had with her signed <span style="">copies of </span>the<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">power </span>of
attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent asked <span style="">if she was the one
who signed above the typewritten name Teofila </span>S. Banigued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alejandra answered yes, saying that Teofila
could not herself <span style="">sign </span>because
she was <span style="">indisposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Then respondent <span style="">explained </span>the
contents of the <span style="">document to Teofila, </span>who expressed her <span style="">con</span>formity thereto and affirmed that
she had <span style="">indeed
authorized her sister-in-law to sign her name for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent </span><span style="">there</span>upon took the document with him
for notarization, and later<span style=""> </span>gave
it to his father who was the attorney-in-fact named there­<span style="">in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Teofila had really given such authority
to Alejandra was confirmed by both of them when they testified in this </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">as well as in </span>the preliminary <span style="">investigation </span>of the charge of <span style="">falsification </span>filed against respondent
before the Assistant Fiscal of Pangasinan.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The third count refers to an affidavit <span style="">prepared </span>by and subscribed and sworn to
before respondent, the <span style="">al</span>legation
being that he knew the contents thereof to be false.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affiants were Justino Z. Flores and Romeo
B. <span style="">Manaois.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>T</span>he fact sworn to by them is that
Maria G. Lopez, <span style="">a daughter </span></span><span style="">of </span><span style="">complainant, was born on </span><st1:date year="1944" day="5" month="4"><span style="">April 5, 1944</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span style="">which
was false, since </span>the correct date of birth is </span><st1:date year="1946" day="5" month="4"><span style="">April 5,
 1946</span></st1:date><span style="">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent, testifying in
his own behalf, <span style="">said </span>that </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">prepared the affidavit a<span style="">t</span>
the instance of complainant herself, who came to his office with Flores and M<span style="">anaois and furnished him the ???? <span class="GramE">to</span> be stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He</span>
was not <span style="">related </span>in any manner to
complainant and did not know that the recitals </span><span style="">in the </span>affidavit were untrue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant told him that its purpose was to enable her daughter to
enter the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Nursing</st1:placename></st1:place>
in <st1:place><st1:placename>Baguio</st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE">,</span>
the latter’s birth certificate not <span style="">being
then available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent </span>had no
interest <span style="">whatsoever in </span>the
matter of her <span style="">studies </span>and had no
reason therefore to compound the falsity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If anybody <span style="">at all was guilty
thereof</span><span style=""> it was complainant
herself, because it was she who supplied respondent the facts to be stated.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We believe </span><span style="">that under the facts <span style="">established
by</span></span><span style=""> </span>the record the
penalty of disbarment or suspension is not warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in connection with the second charge
respondent is guilty <span style="">of a </span>certain degree of <span style="">laxity
and </span>carelessness in notarizing a power-of-attorney which, although duly
acknowledged by the parties, was known to him not to have been signed by the <span style="">principal </span>but by another upon her
authority, without such fact being made to appear on the face of the document
itself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, <span style="">respondent
Manuel B. <span style="">Casaclang is hereby
reprimanded, and </span></span><span style="">warned </span><span style="">to be </span><span style="">more </span><span style="">careful in the performance </span><span style="">of his notarial duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let this decision be noted in respondent's
record as a member of the </span><span style="">Bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
