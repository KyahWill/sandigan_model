				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Civil Service, the Treasurer and Auditor of
the City of Manila, are appealing from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila (in its Civil Case No. 53383), declaring the order of
appellant Civil Service Commissioner, terminating the services of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Billy <span class="SpellE">Millares</span> null and
void, and ordering appellants city officials to pay <span class="SpellE">Millares</span>'
salary from February 15, 1963 and thereafter, at the rate of P6<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> per annum.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case are not in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under date of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="9">September
 24, 1962</st1:date>, Billy <span class="SpellE">Millares</span>, a lawyer
employed in the office of the City Treasurer of Manila since 1946, was
appointed "Technical Assistant on Fiscal Matters" in the office of
the Mayor of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
with compensation at P6<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> per annum, effective <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointment further carried the notation
- "transfer from the office of the City Treasurer, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
as Field Supervisor at P3<span class="GramE">,120.00</span> p.a." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Submitted to the Civil Service Commission, the appointment was
approved by the Chief, Personnel Transactions Division, signing on behalf of
the then Acting Commissioner of Civil Service (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1-A).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 8, 1963,
Acting Commissioner of Civil Service <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> issued an order (sent to the City Mayor of Manila
for compliance) terminating the services of Billy <span class="SpellE">Millares</span>,
on the grounds that although <span class="SpellE">Millares</span> has passed the
bar examinations, the position of Technical Assistant on Fiscal Matters does
not re­quire the knowledge of the law profession and the latter's bar-elig­ibility
under Republic Act 1080 is only equivalent to second grade, thus, he cannot
receive more than P3,720.00 per annum; that <span class="SpellE">Millares</span>
has not pursued any course in economics, banking or finance; that the approval
of the appointment was not complete, because it was signed by the Chief of the
Personnel Transactions Division who has no authority to approve appointments or
promotions involving com­pensation beyond P4,800.00; that the position in
question should have been filled by certification from the appropriate register
of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>; and that the transfer of <span class="SpellE">Millares</span>, from field inspector in the office of the City
Treasurer at P3,120.00 per annum to that of Technical Assistant on Fiscal Matters,
office of the City Mayor, at P6,600.00 per annum, was irregular (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Following the directive
of the Commissioner of Civil Service, further payment of the salary of <span class="SpellE">Millares</span> was discontinued by the City Treasurer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 14, 1963, and after the Civil Service Commissioner had
refused to revoke his order, <span class="SpellE">Millares</span> filed an action
for mandamus against herein appellants in the Court of First Instance of Manila
(<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Case No. 53383), asserting that the Civil
Service Commissioner had no authority to terminate his services there having
been no admin­istrative charges filed against him, and that the withholding of
his salaries by the City Treasurer and the City Auditor was made in violation
of Section 4, Article XII of the Constitution and Section 32 of Republic Act
2260.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">For his part, respondent Civil Service
Commissioner contended that the action complained of was within the general
powers conferred on him "to enforce, execute and carry out the
constitutional and stat­utory provisions on the merit system" (Sec. 1,
Art. <span class="GramE">XII, Constitution; Sec. 16-b, Rep. Act 2260), and
"to have exclusive jurisdiction over the approval under the Civil Service
law and rules of all appointments including promotions to positions in the
competitive service."</span> (Sec. 16-h, Rep. Act 2260)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Respondents</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> officials alleged that the
withholding of the salaries of petitioner was made in obedience to the order of
the Commissioner of Civil Service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due hearing,
decision was rendered for the petitioner, the court holding that, as two of the
four duties assigned to him involve knowledge of the law profession, petitioner
may be considered a first-</span>grader; that having been employed in the
office of the City Treasurer of Manila for 16 years, he must have received
practical training in finance and economics; that although the appointment
stated that it was a transfer from the position of field inspector in the
office of the City Treasurer with compensation at P3,120.00 per annum, it was
evidently both a transfer and promotion and, consequently, not gov­erned by the
rule on transfers; that the list of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span> does
not in­clude technical assistant on fiscal matters; that there is no proof that
the approval of petitioner's appointment by the Chief of the Per­sonnel
Transactions Division of the Civil Service Commission was <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span> act; and that the summary termination of
petitioner's ser­vices without observance of due process makes his removal
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, therefore,
rendered judgment as stated at the begin­ning of this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein appellants raise several legal issues which can be re­stated
as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not
petitioner is qualified to occupy the position of Technical Assistant on Fiscal
Matters in the office of the City Mayor of Manila; (2) whether or not the
appointment of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was made in
pursuance of the Civil Service rules on certification and transfer; (3) whether
or not there was valid approval of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
appointment by the Civil Service Commission; (4) whether or not the Civil Service
Commissioner has authority to order the revoca­tion or cancellation of
appointments already approved; (5) whether or not appellant Commissioner of
Civil Service has authority to order the termination of the services of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>; and (6) whether or not the institution of the
present court proceeding was proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The first issue calls for the resolution of other questions,
namely, whether or not the position of "Technical Assistant on Fiscal
Matters" involves "professional knowledge of law” and, whether or not
to qualify for appointment to that position, it is necessary for petitioner to
have taken subjects in economics and finance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of Republic Act 1080, as amended by Republic Act 1844,
reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span> The bar examinations and
the examina­tions given by the various boards of examiners of the Government
are declared as civil service examinations, and shall, <u>for purposes of
appointment to positions in the classified service the duties of which involve
knowl­edge of the respective professions</u> except positions re­quiring highly
specialized knowledge not covered by the ordinary board examinations, be
considered as equivalent to the first grade regular examination given by the
Bureau of Civil Service if the profession requires at least four years of study
in college, and as equi­valent to the second grade regular examination if the
profession requires less than four years of college study:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>however</u>, That such bar or board
examination shall be equivalent to the next lower grade of civil service examination
when the person is to be employed in a position other than one requir­ing his
professional knowledge:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Underscor­ing
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
position involved in this case, the Mayor of Manila issued a certification,
dated October 8, 1962, that petitioner was assigned the following duties:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. Study and check ways and means of increasing collec­tion of
revenues for the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. To handle and investigate cases pertaining to City Finances and
make reports of his findings to the Mayor;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Study and propose ordinances pertaining to revenue measures
affecting the City Government; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. To assist in general the Mayor on other matters pertaining to
the City Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> B)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Explaining the nature and
scope of the foregoing duties, petitioner testified:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A In connection with my duty, that is, to study and check
ways and means of increasing collection of revenue for the City of Manila, I
know of pending tax cases with the Office of the City Treasurer and Office of
the License Division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this respect, I
see to it that pending cases with the Office of the Mayor are acted upon
immediately, and those cases referred to the Office of the Mayor by inspectors
from the Office of the City Treasurer are studied by me and I assist the Office
of the City Fiscal, after which I make my recommendation either for immediate
closure or for collection on the basis of court deci­sions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mayor then signs my recommendation and
the same is approved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As regards tax cases that are pending with the Office of the
City Treasurer that I know - because I had been with that office for a number
of years prior to my ap­pointment as technical assistant on fiscal matters in <span style="">the Office of the Mayor - I recommend to His
Honor, the Mayor, the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of these cases to
the Of­fice of the Mayor (must be the Fiscal) for appropriate action.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q With respect to your duty No. 3 in this Exhibit B, what
exactly do you do, regarding your duty to study and propose ordinances
pertaining to revenue measures affecting the city government?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A In that regard the Mayor has instructed
me to study the present laws <span style="">on tax </span>allotments
to local govern­ments.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we all
know, one of the sources of the city revenue is the aid from the national
government to the local governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
aids are based on tax laws and the Mayor has instructed me to make a thorough
study of these different tax laws with the view of increasing the allotments to
local governments, more particularly to the City of Manila, and also of finding
a way whereby we could formulate or propose a bill which would give an
authority to cities or local governments to retain that which is due them,
because under present laws before the city or local government could get a
revenue it has yet to be passed upon by the national government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the Mayor wants a law - if we could make
or propose a bill - which would automatically grant the local government an
author­ity to retain that which is due the local government." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 4-6, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="8"><span class="GramE">Aug. 24, 1963</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As thus testified to,
which testimony respondents-appellants failed to rebut, it is evident that the
nature of the duties assigned to and performed by petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> requires the use of his knowledge as a lawyer;
that the discharge of the duties attached to the office actually involves the
exercise of the legal profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
law-course involves more than 4 years of study, the conversion of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> bar-qualification into first grade eligibility
under Republic Act 1080, as amended, was proper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no denying the
laudable purpose of appellant Civil Ser­vice Commissioner in requiring the
appointee to the position of Tech­nical Assistant on Fiscal Matters to have
some knowledge of finance and economics.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is really high time that </span><span style="">we
</span><span style="">adhere, strictly, to the merit
principle embodied in the Civil Service law and the Constitu­tion, and give due
recognition to the desirability of specialization in the public service, the
way it is observed in more progressive coun­tries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the present case, a lawyer with
background in econ­omics and finance certainly would have been preferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, </span>there being no showing that
when the disputed appointment was ex­tended, there were other eligible persons
better prepared, technically, than herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
or that the latter was not competent to dis­charge the duties attached to said
office, the ruling of the lower court that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is qualified to hold the position must be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to the second issue, it may be pointed out that, in
connection with the filling of vacant position, the Revised Civil Service law
(Rep. Act 2260) is very specific.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Whenever a vacancy occurs in any competitive or classified
position in the government or in any government-owned or controlled corporation
or en­tity, the officer or employee next in rank who is com­petent and
qualified to hold the position and who pos­sesses an appropriate civil service
eligibility shall be promoted thereto:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
That should there be two or more persons under equal circumstances, se­niority
shall be given preference:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>And</u>, <u>provided</u>,
<u>how­ever</u>, That should there be any special reason or reasons why such
officer or employee should not be <u>promoted</u>, such special reason or
reasons shall be stated in writ­ing by the appointing official and the officer
or employee concerned shall be informed thereof and be given an opportunity to
be heard by the Commissioner of Civil Service whose decision in such case shall
be final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If the vacancy is not
filled by promotion as provided herein, then the same shall be filled by
transfer</u> of pre­sent employees in the government service, by <u>reinstate­ment</u>,
<u>by reemployment</u> of persons separated through re­duction in force, <u>or
by certification from appropriate re­gisters of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span></u>,
in accordance with rules promulgated in pursuance of this Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> <span class="GramE">(Sec. 23; underscor­ing
supplied.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, a vacant position (be it new or created by the
cessation of an incumbent in office) shall be filled by promotion of the
ranking officer or employee, who is competent and qualified<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to hold the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And only where, for
special reason or reasons of which the affected officer or employee will be
notified, this mode of recruitment or selection cannot be observed, that the
position may be filled either by transfer, or re-employment, or by getting from
the certified list of appropriate <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>, <u>in</u>
<u>that</u> <u>order</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar,
however, no evidence was presented that </span>there were ranking employees in
the office of the City Mayor affect­ed by the appointment of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to the position involved herein. We have to rule,
therefore, that the appointment in question did not violate the next-in-rank or
seniority rule of the Civil Service Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the charge of irregularity in the transfer of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, from the position of field supervisor, at
P3,120.00 per annum, to that of Technical Assistant at P6,600.00 per annum, it
may be stated that a transfer is a "movement from one position to another
which is of <u>equivalent</u> rank, level or salary, without break in service."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Prom­otion, on the other hand, is the "advancement from one position to
another with an increase in duties and responsibilities as authorized by <span class="GramE">law,</span> and usually accompanied by an increase in salary."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no allegation that the <u>transfer</u> of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from the pos­ition of field supervisor in the
office of the City Treasurer to that of Technical Assistant on Fiscal Matters
in the office of the City Mayor in­volves an increase of his duties and
responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But assuming this to
be so, such increase of duties would not justify an increase of his salary
simultaneous with his transfer of office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, under the Civil Service rules, promotion and transfer connote two
different personnel movements which cannot take place, in a single instance, at
the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas the first denotes
a scalar ascent of a senior officer or employee to another position, higher
either in rank or salary, the se­cond refers to a lateral movement from one
position to another, of <u>equivalent</u> rank, level or salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, this rule prohibiting an immediate
increase of compensation in cases of transfers was intend­ed to safeguard the
rule on seniority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
latest appointment, insofar as it involves an immediate increase of
compensation, is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Civil Service rules
and, therefore, invalid.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To comply strictly with the Civil Service policy regulations in
force at the time of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> transfer,
the same should not have included any immediate increase in salary, but without
pre­judice to a subsequent promotional appointment after a minimum ser­vice <span style="">of </span>three months in the new position
for the policy established before 1967 was,</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">that</span> appointments of employees
transferring from one agency to another at a higher salary rate shall be ap­proved
at the salary last received in the former Office, and that the full rate shall
be allowed only after the <span style="">employees
concerned shall have completed three months of service in the new agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said policy was designed to protect the
promotional opportun­ities of insiders who, although not next in rank, meet the
requirements for appointment to vacant positions in their respective
offices." (<span class="GramE">see</span> par. 1, Civil Service Commission
Memorandum Circular No. 19, series of 1967).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering, however, the equities and circumstances of the case,
and particularly that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Millares</span> has been
found qualified for the position of Technical Assistant on Fiscal Matters; that
<span style="">no evidence was produced that his
services in the new position have not been satisfactory, and that the City
Mayor's insistence upon his ap­pointment is substantially equivalent to a
promotional appointment, we are of the opinion that petitioner should be
considered entitled to full compensation after three months from his original
transfer from the City Treasurer's office to that of the City Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus unnecessary to determine the
authority of the Chief of Personnel Transactions Division to approve the
disputed appointment of peti­tioner herein or the authority of the Commissioner
to revoke such appointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The directive of appellant Commissioner of Civil Service
terminating the services of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on
account of his im­proper <span class="GramE">transfer,</span> is not in
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner's power of
removal, demotion or suspension, it must be remembered, arises from his
authority over all subordinate officers and employees, members of the Civil
Service, in all matters relating to their conduct, dis­cipline, and efficiency,
and this authority may be exercised only for any of the causes provided in
Section 33, Article VII of Republic Act 2260, as implemented by Sections 3 and
19, Rule XVIII, Civil Service Rules, and after due notice and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As improper transfer from one position in the
government service to another is not one of the grounds for dismissal of an
employee, the order of appellant Civil Service Commissioner has no basis in
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of the propriety of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
resorting to the courts from the unfavorable decision of the Civil Service
Commissioner, suffice it to state that the action taken by the latter was not
in the exercise of his power to impose disciplinary measures to erring
subordinate officers and employees, which is subject to review by the Civil
Service Board of Appeals and the President, but in pursuance of his power to
approve (or disapprove) appoint­ments. In the exercise of this latter function,
the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commissioner is exclusive.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously, appellant's claim of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies in
this case, is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For all the foregoing considerations</b>, the decision
appealed from is modified, upholding the authority of the Commissioner of Civil
Service to withhold approval of petitioner's appointment as Technical Assistant
on Fiscal Matters insofar as it involves an immediate increase of compensation
to P6,600.00 per annum, but declaring invalid the order of said Commissioner
terminating petitioner's employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
payment of the salaries of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, for
actual services rendered, at the rate of P3<span class="GramE">,120.00</span> per
annum, for the first three (3) months following his transfer and at full rate
thereafter, is also hereby directed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
