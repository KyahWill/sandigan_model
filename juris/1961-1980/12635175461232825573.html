Vincent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Sumbillo</span> and, Reynaldo Angeles entered into a contract with
the Mobil Oil Philippines, Inc., entitled "LOAN &amp; MORTGAGE AGREE­MENT,"

<blockquote>“(a) For and in
consideration of Sales Agreement dated July 21, 1965, among the parties here­in,
Mobil grants a loan of P150,000 to borrowers.</blockquote>

faithful performance by Borrowers of that Sales Agreement, Defendants-Borrowers
hereby transfer in favor of Mobil by way of first mortgage lands covered by TCT
No. 45169 and TCT No. 45170, together with the improvements existing in said

<p class="BODY">No appeal having been interposed by the defendants, the above

<p class="BODY">An undated Mobil's motion for execution of the decision and for
the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ylagan</span>
as special sheriff (an­nex D) was received by the herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, he filed
his opposition and motion to stay execution, alleging that before the finality
of the aforesaid judg­ment, he and the plaintiff had agreed not to appeal
and/or file any motion for reconsideration, the petitioner offering to pay <span style="">his </span>one-third share with a reasonable
discount, if possible, in so far as the interests and the award for attorney's
fees were concerned, with the corresponding release of the mortgage on all his
pro­perties, and praying, in view thereof, for a 30-day grace period within
which to pay the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 30-day
grace period was granted by <span style="">the </span>court
in its order of <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1968</st1:date>.
</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1968</st1:date>
the petitioner filed another motion for 20 days' extension within which to pay
his one-third share of the judgment obligation and to submit the corresponding
compromise agreement for the satisfaction of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said motion was granted on <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1968</st1:date>. </p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the respondent Mobil filed an "Urgent Reply to
Opposition and <span style="">M</span>otion to Stay
Execution dated Feb. 21, 1968 and Motion dated March 25, 1968," alleging
therein that the res­pondent agreed to release the mortgage or collateral for
the en­tire judgment obligation only if "the whole principal mortgaged
debt plus the whole accrued interest" were fully paid. Mobil further
prayed for a writ of execution to be issued against the peti­tioner after the
lapse of 20 <span style="">days
</span>from <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1968</st1:date>,
if by then the parties shall not have submitted a compromise agreement <span style="">for the satisfaction of the judgment; Mobil
also reiterated its prayer for the appointment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ylagan</span> as special sheriff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 3, 1968 the petitioner filed a manifestation and motion,
praying that he be allowed to deposit with the Clerk of Court the amount
corresponding to his one-third share of the obli­gation under the decision of
November 17, 1967, and that there­upon the collateral or mortgage over
petitioner's properties or lands be ordered released or cancelled.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1968</st1:date>
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> ordered all pending in­cidents set for hearing
on. <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1968</st1:date>,
"so that the Court may have the opportunity to confer with the parties to
thresh out the settlement of this case." At this hearing Mobil did not
appear; the court reset the hearing for <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="5">May
 23, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under date of May 8, 1968, Mobil filed an addendum to <span style="">its reply </span>dated
April 1, 1968 <span style="">and
opposition to petitioner's motion dated April </span>3, 1968, praying that the
motion of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> <span style="">that </span>the entire mortgaged collateral be released upon his pay<span style="">ment </span>of mere
1/3 of the loan <span style="">obligation, </span>be denied and instead a <span style="">writ of </span>execution against him in
accordance with the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
decision and sections 2 and 3 of Rule 68 of the <span style="">Revised </span>Rules of Court be issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1968</st1:date>
the petitioner filed his rejoinder <span style="">to respondent Mobil's aforesaid addendum </span>and
opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
May 23, </span>1968; after hearing oral argument, the court denied the
manifestation and motion of <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> filed thru counsel
and dated <span style="">April
</span>3, 1968; the court further ruled that "There is no further need to
issue an order for the issuance of a writ of exe­cution and appointment of
special sheriff ... considering that the <span style="">Court, in </span>its order of February 24, 1968, has
already ordered <span style="">the issuance of a writ
of execution for the satisfaction of the judg­ment."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner then filed his petition for certiorari with the
Court of Appeals, dated May 30, 1968, alleging that "respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> acted without or in excess of his jurisdiction and/or
with grave abuse of discretion, in denying petitioner's motion to allow him to
pay or deposit his one-third share of the judgment obligation" <span style="">as </span>well as the consequent release or
can­cellation of the mortgage on his properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, however, in its minute resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1968</st1:date>, dismissed the petition
for certiorari, in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon consideration of the petition for certiorari filed in
this case, the Court RE­SOLVED TO DISMISS the petition, there being no abuse of
discretion in ordering the execu­tion of a final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Details of execution for satisfaction of
Vincent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit's</span> liability will be worked out in
connection with the sale of the collateral for mortgaged debt, and the judgment
in Civil Case No. 64138 of the CFI-Manila will control the disposition and
appli­cation of the collateral."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1968</st1:date> which the Court of
Appeals denied in its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="7">July
 9, 1968</st1:date>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Both the petition and the motion for reconsideration are
based on a misapprehen­sion of the terms of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mortgage obligation is one and
indivisible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was executed to assure
payment of the total in­debtedness of the three defendants in Civil Case No.
64138, and not merely one-third (1/3) thereof corresponding to petitioner
Vincent P. <span class="SpellE">Dayrit's</span> liability."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petitioner's second motion for
reconsideration of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1968</st1:date>
was summarily dismissed on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="8">August 5,
 1968</st1:date>, for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, in his present petition, tenders the fol­lowing
issues for resolution:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"1) </span><u>Whether or not respondent
Judge</u> <span style="">[CFI-Manila] </span><u>acted
without or in excess of his jurisdiction, and/ or with grave abuse of
discretion in denying petitioner's motion to allow him to exer</u><u><span style="">cise his clearly legal right to pay or
deposit his one-third share of the judgment</span></u><span style="">;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2) <u>The next
issue was that brought about by the </u><u><span style="">Court of Appeals </span>resolution dismissing the petition for
certiorari,</u> <u>and which was raised in petitioner's motion dated June 19,
1968 </u><u><span style="">for reconsideration of said
resolution</span></u><span style="">, <u>contending
that the ground </u></span><u><span style="">for </span></u><u><span style="">dismissal did not jibe with the issue raised
in the petition for certiorari</span></u><span style="">;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3) <u>And lastly</u>,
<u>the Court of Appeals' resolution of </u><st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="7"><u>July 9, 1968</u></st1:date><u> denying said motion for
reconsideration apprehension on the part of petitioner of the terms </u><u><span style="">of the respondent judge</span></u><span style="">.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1. The question raised by the respondent Mobil that the present
petition for certiorari was filed way beyond the <span class="SpellE">regle­mentary</span>
period of 15 days from appellant's receipt of notice of judgment or of the
denial of his motion for reconsideration pur­suant to section 1, Rule 45 of the
Revised Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
needs to be resolved before consideration of this case on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, the <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> first motion for reconsideration filed by the
herein petitioner was denied, and copy of such denial was received by the
petitioner <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="7">J<u>uly 15, 1968</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still not satisfied, petitioner filed another
<u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> </span>motion for
reconsideration on <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1968</st1:date>,
notice of the denial of which, under CA resolution <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="8"><span style="">August 5, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, was </span><span style="">received </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">said </span>petitioner

 </span></u><u><span style="">9, 1968</span></u></st1:date><span style="">.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent Mobil contends
</span>that the second motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner was a
<u>mere scrap of paper</u> and <u>pro forma</u> since it was filed <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> and <u>without express leave of court</u><span style="">, </span>contrary to the mandate of section
1, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The <span style="">rule </span>appears to be inflexible in the
sense that no more than one motion for reconsideration shall be filed without
express leave of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement
that the second motion for recon­sideration must be presented, with leave of
court, within fifteen days from notice of the order or judgment, deducting the
time during which the first motion was pending, is to afford the court
sufficient time to evaluate whether there is <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> merit
therein, so that, "if the court finds merit <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> in
the mo­tion for rehearing or reconsideration, the adverse party shall be given
time to answer, after which the <span style="">court,
in its </span>discretion, may set the case for oral argument."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
And only upon compliance with the above stated requirements may the second
motion for reconsideration stay the final order or judgment sought to be re-<span style="">examined.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals gave due course to the second mo­tion for
reconsideration of the herein petitioner, but nevertheless, dismissed the same
summarily for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">However, even assuming, that the <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> second motion for reconsideration was
properly filed so as to toll the <span class="SpellE">reglemen­tary</span> period
within which to appeal, it appears that the petition for certiorari filed with
this Court on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1968</st1:date>
was time barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the date of denial
of the petitioner's <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> first
motion for reconsideration received by him on July 15, 1968 assuming that the
period was interrupted by the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
second motion for reconsideration from July 26, 1968 to August 9, 1968 (15
days) - to the elevation of the said case to this Court on Aug­ust 20, 1968, 36
days had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deducting the 15 days
during which the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> second motion
for reconsideration was pending from the total period of 36 days leaves 21
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that the present
petition was filed with this Court six days late, con­trary to and in violation
of section 1, <span style="">Rule </span>45, which
specifically <span style="">provides that a petition
for certiorari under such Rule should be filed within 15 days from notice of
judgment or denial of motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition may be dis­missed
on the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">But we opt, nevertheless, to consider the
merits of this case, if only to demonstrate to the petitioner his error.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The decision of the lower court, let it not be forgotten, has
admittedly become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, the prayer of the complaint <span style="">filed with the
respondent Court of First Instance </span>recites as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be
rendered –</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a) Ordering the defendants to pay the sum of P147,484 with
10% interest per annum from the time, it fell due as agreed upon and that in
default of such payment, the above described properties be sold and the
proceeds of sale be applied to the payment of the amount due to the plaintiff
from the defendants under this complaint."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The complaint, in effect, is <span class="SpellE">acollection</span> suit with damages and foreclosure of mortgage
against the three defendants, <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumbillo</span>, Reynaldo Angeles and Vincent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>.
Although the Loan and Mortgage Agreement was signed by the three defen­dants as
mortgagors, the properties being foreclosed belong solely to, and are
registered solely in the name of, the petitioner Vincent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">pertinent </span><span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision rendered by the lower
court reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the said judgment is a <u>simple
money judgment</u> and not a <u>foreclosure judgment,</u> and that because the
respondent Mobil resorted to the remedy of enforcing his right by a complaint against
the defendant-petitioner for collec­tion of a sum of money, with the consequent
simple money judg­ment, the satisfaction of his 1/3 share of the joint
obligation would release all the mortgaged properties put up as collateral to
secure the payment of the whole obligation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason ad­vanced by the petitioner is that the decision rendered
being a simple money judgment and not a mortgage-foreclosure judg­ment, the
distinction in its execution is decisive, that is, where­as in mortgage
foreclosure the judgment should conform to the requirement, embodied in section
2, Rule 68 of the Rules of Court, that the order of payment be made into the
court "within a period not less than ninety (90) days x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and in default of such
payment, the property mortgaged be sold to realize" the indebtedness, in a
simple money judgment, upon satisfaction of part (in the instant case his 1/3
share) of the joint obligation, the mortgaged properties should be released
from such mort­gage contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention of the petitioner is clearly devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision which the petitioner describes as a <u>simple money
judgment</u> orders the defendants Vincent <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Leonila</span></span><span style=""> </span>T. <span class="SpellE">Sumbillo</span>
and Reynaldo Angeles to pay the plaintiff the sum of P147,434, and in default
of such payment, <u>the properties put up <span style="">in </span>collateral shall be sold in foreclosure sale</u> in accordance
with law, <u>the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>proceeds to be applied
in payment of the amount due to </u><u><span style="">the
plaintiff from the defendants as claimed </span>in the complaint</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">While
it </span>is true that the obligation is merely joint and each of the
defendants is obliged to pay only his/her 1/3 share of the joint obligation,
the undisputed fact remains that the intent and purpose of the Loan and
Mortgage Agreement was to secure, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
the entire loan of P150,000 that the respondent Mobil extended to the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court below found that
the defen­dants had violated the Loan and Mortgage Agreement, they hav­ing paid
but one installment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The undisputed fact
also remains that the petitioner alone benefited from the proceeds of the loan
of P150,000, the said amount having been paid directly to the Bank of the
Philippines to bail out the same properties from a mortgage that was about to
be foreclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, Mobil mere­ly
stepped into the shares of the Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner insists that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the judgment declaring the obligation merely joint with the proviso
that "<u>a<span style="">s to <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span></span></u><span style="">, </span><u>his liability sh</u><u><span style="">all in no case exceed 1/3 of the</span></u><u><span style=""> total obliga</span></u><u><span style="">tion,</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">should be construed in
the light of the opi­<span style="">nion </span>of the
lower court that "<u>said collateral must answer in <span style="">full but only to </span>the extent of <span class="SpellE">Dayrits</span> liability which as above deter­<span style="">mined</span></u><span style="">, <u>is 1/</u></span><u>3 of the obligation</u>, thereby entitling him to
pay or <span style="">deposit in </span>court his
corresponding share of the joint obligation in satisfaction thereof, with the
automatic release of all the mort­gaged properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A
</span><span style="">judgment </span>must be

not the judgment <span style="">itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They amount to nothing more </span><span style="">than </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">order for judgment which must be distinguished from the <span style="">judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>"When several things are pledged or mort­gaged, each thing for
a determinate portion of the debt, the pledges or mortgages are considered
separate from each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when the
several things are given to secure the same debt in its en­tirety,<span style=""> all of them are liable for the debt, and the
creditor does not have to divide his action by dis­tributing the debt among the
various things pledged or mortgaged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even when only a part of the debt remains unpaid, all the things are
still liable for such balance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, a
mortgage voluntarily con­stituted by the debtor on two or more parcels of land
is one and indivisible, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">the mortgagee has the right to have either or
both parcels, joint­ly or singly, sold to satisfy his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case the mortgaged properties are a house
and lot, it can not be claimed that the lot and the house should be sold
separately and not together."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But then there is this other seeming posture of the peti­tioner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the judgment which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> either modified or superseded the Loan and
Mortgage Agree­ment between the parties, and since the obligation is merely
joint, upon payment thereof, as in attachment, the properties <span style="">mortgaged are released from liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision under con­sideration, however,
did nothing of the sort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
conveniently refused to recognize the true import of the <span class="SpellE">dispo­sitive</span>
portion of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
portion unequivocally states that "<u>in default of such payment</u>, <u>the
properties put up in collateral shall be sold in foreclosure sale in accordance
with law,</u> <u>the proceeds to be applied in payment of the amount due to</u>
<u>the plaintiff as claims d in the complaint</u>." And the claim in the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">complaint was the full satisfaction of the
total indebtedness of P147,434; therefore, the release of all the mortgaged
properties </span>may be authorized only upon the full payment of the
above-stated amount secured by the said mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the provisions of section 2 of Rule 68 of the
Rules of Court giving the petitioner a period of 90 days with­in which he might
voluntarily pay the debt before the sale of the collateral at public auction
was ordered, we agree that the trial court failed to provide such period.
However, this failure can be regarded as having resulted in mere <span class="SpellE"><u>damnum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>absque</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>injuria</u></span><u>.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From November 17, 1967 when the decision was rendered to May 23, 1968
when the final order to sell the mortgaged properties was issued, a period of
more than <span style="">six </span>months had passed,
which is considerably much more than the 90-day period of grace al­lowed the
petitioner to validly tender the proper payment.</p>
