				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this suit for the refund of a penalty alleged to be erroneously
and illegally collected, the amount due and demandable being in excess of what
ought to have been paid on the realty tax due, it being shown that the first
installment of such tax was paid on time, but the second installment, through
oversight, was not remitted until after the lapse of one month from the date
due, the question is whether or not the tax payer should be held liable for the
penalty based on the amount of the whole tax to be computed from the date such
tax was due or from the time the second installment ought to have been paid but
was not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, on the basis
of the statute providing that all taxes on real estate are due and payable
annually on the first day of June, held that delinquency is to be counted from
such a date even if the first installment were paid on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as alleged by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Padilla against the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and its City Treasurer, were substantially admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plain­tiff is the absolute owner of the
property consisting of land and improvements in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city> assessed at
P113,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on such assessment,
the total tax due for 1963 on said property was P1,412.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, as taxpayer, taking advantage of
an option granted him by the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Charter,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
paid the fifty per cent first installment of the realty tax due that year
within the period allowed by law in the amount of P706.25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second installment in the same amount
ought to have been paid not later than <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="10">October
 30, 1963</st1:date>, but through oversight, it was not until December 23, of
that fear that it was done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
<st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Treasurer required plaintiff to pay a penalty of P169. 50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was paid under protest, it being the con­tention
of plaintiff that, based on the statute,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
he should have been required to pay only the sum of P28.25, there being only
one full month of delinquency, the payment having been made on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore sought the refund of P141.25 as
being in excess of the penalty that could be legally imposed on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer by defendants alleged that the
statutory provision correctly construed would not justify the claim for refund
of the amount collected, which was the proper penalty under the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, in a decision appealed from, sustained defend­ants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
provision of the first paragraph of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
Section 43 of Republic Act 183, provides, among other things, that all taxes on
real estate for any year shall be <u>due and payable annually on the first day
of June</u> and from this date such taxes together with all penalties accruing
thereto shall constitute a lien on the property subject to taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, a taxpayer who fails to pay his
real estate tax on the first day of June, the date when the tax becomes due and
payable, is delinquent from that time on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When plaintiff did not therefore, pay the whole amount of his estate tax
due on the first day of June, he already became delinquent from then on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention of the plaintiff that he
became delinquent only after <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="10">October
 31, 1963</st1:date>, when he failed to pay the second half of the installment
for the payment <span style="color: windowtext;">of the total tax due, is
erroneous."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> It therefore dismissed as already noted, the
complaint with costs against plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In appellant's brief, it is submitted that the taxpayer having
been given an option to pay his realty tax in two installments and appellant
having paid within the permissible period, the first installment, he could not
be considered delinquent insofar as the first half of the realty tax is due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His delinquency should date only from <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1963</st1:date> by virtue of his
failure to pay on October 30 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For appellant, it is inconceivable "how he can be declared
delinquent from <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="6">June <span style="color: windowtext;">1,<i> </i>1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;"> since the second installment of his real estate tax
was not yet due on that date but will have become due and payable only on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">the thirtieth of
 October 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> The decision, according to appellant, "negates
the taxpayer’s option to pay his realty tax in two (2) installments, as
expressly granted"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> by law and amounted to “unwarranted judicial
legislation.”<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's theory is not implausible. Nonetheless, it must yield
to the specific language of the law which is controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last sentence of the first paragraph of
the controlling legal provision<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"All taxes on real
estate for any year shall be due and payable annually on the first day of June
and from this date such taxes together with all penalties accruing thereto
shall constitute a lien on the property subject to such taxation." Two
para­graphs later, the taxpayer is given the option to pay "in two install­ments
to be fixed annually by the Municipal Board simultaneously with the rate <u>per
centum ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span></u> taxation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That the time limit for the
first and second installments shall be set at not later than the thirty-first
day of May and the thirtieth day of October of each year, respectively."
Then comes the provision as to the penalty to be im­posed in case of
delinquency and how to fix the same:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"At the expi­ration of time for the payment of the real estate tax
without penalty, the taxpayer shall be subject, from the first day of
delinquency, to the payment of a penalty at the rate of two <u>per</u> <u>centum</u>
for each full month of delinquency that has expired, on the amount of the
original tax due, until the tax shall have been paid in full or until the
property shall have been forfeited to the city as provided in this Act:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That in no case shall the
total penalty exceed twenty-four <u>per</u> <u>centum</u>, of the original tax
due."</p>

<p class="BODY">Construed together, the above provisions yield no other
conclusion but that the taxes are due and payable "on the first day of
June" from which date "such taxes together with all penalties
accruing thereto shall constitute a lien on the property subject to such
taxation." It is true the taxpayer is given the option to pay in two
installments with the respective dates for the payment thereof "at not
later than the thirty-first day of May and the thirtieth day of October of each
year, respectively." Then comes the crucial and decisive provision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At the expiration of the time for the
payment of the real estate tax without penalty, the taxpayer shall be subject
from the first day of delinquency, <span style="color: windowtext;">to the
Payment of a penalty at the rate of two <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> for each full
month of delinquency that has expired, on the amount of the original tax due,
until the tax shall have been paid in full or until the property shall have
been forfeited to the city * * *."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The law is specific and mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It calls for application as thus worded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no room for interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty is to be based "on the
amount of the original tax due." The fact that the first installment was
made on time does not benefit the taxpayer at all, if thereafter the second
installment were not paid on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
effect then, the option thus granted, to pay in two installments, must be
strictly complied with, otherwise the operation of the plain statutory command
that the tax due and payable on June 1st becomes unavoidable, and delinquency
is to be computed from such a date.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that a statute, free from any constitutional
infirmity, must be enforced as written.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The applicable provision, viewed as a whole, makes clear that the
penalty must be computed from the time the realty tax was due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent that the lower court decision
adheres literally to such provision, it cannot be assailed as erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The conclusion reached is
reinforced by the principle that lies behind a recent decision in <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> Mining Co., Inc. v. The Com­missioner of Internal
Revenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The principal issue in the case, according to the opinion of Justice Castro, is
whether the petitioner's obligation to pay the whole amount of its tax arose
upon its failure to pay the first installment thereof on <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1958</st1:date>, without need of notice or demand
from the respondent Commissioner." After quoting the appropriate legal
provision,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
that if any installment is not paid on or before the date fixed for its
payment, the whole amount of the tax "shall be paid upon notice and
demand," the opinion goes on to state that to sustain petitioner's
contention that there should be such a notice or demand would be to place in
the hands of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the power to condone
interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a con­sequence, the
Court could not look with approval on, not only because of the uncertainty that
would be created and the possibility of the uneven application of the law, but
likewise because of the demands of public policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that the case is not squarely in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None­theless, the peremptory requirements of
public policy that would stress the necessity for full and unconditional
compliance with the language of the law are present in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in that opinion less
than full adherence to the wording of the statute did not suffice to defeat the
challenged government exertion of the taxing power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, as here, there is no basis for such an
assertion, there being fidelity to what is required by the legal pro­vision applicable,
what was done by defendant City of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> could not be
successfully assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation to
pay a penalty having been thus provided for in language that evinced
legislative intent clearly and the taxpayer having it within his power to avoid
the imposition of such penalty in the event he chooses to exercise the option
of paying in two installments by avoiding late remittance of the tax due, it
does appear clear that no departure from the legal norm had been shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms of the statute provide the safest
guide as to the statutory policy, to which obedience is due and from which
deviation is not allowable.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed judgment must stand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the express provision of the statute, the penalty at the
rate of two <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> on the amount of the original tax due
should be imposed "for each full month of delinquency." The payment
for the second installment having been made on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1963</st1:date>, the month of December is to be
excluded from computation of the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From June to November, at the rate of P28.25, which is 2% of the tax
due, based on P1,412.50, the amount that should be collected is P169.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such amount having been collected as penalty,
the appellant paid exactly what was due.</p>
