<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal from the 
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in 
Civil Case No. 4654, dismissing appellants' complaint against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. The appeal, originally taken to the Court of 
Appeals, was certified to this Court for review, there being no dispute as to 
the facts and the issues raised being questions of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants filed the complaint to 
seek the cancellation of a mortgage which they had executed in favor of the 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. They alleged that in November, 1956, they 
entered into an agreement with the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> whereby 
the latter would finance the construction of an apartment house costing not more 
than P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> on appellants' lot in 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. To secure the payment of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> expenses in building the house, a mortgage on the 
lot was to be executed in his favor. According to appellants, they executed the 
mortgage but the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> failed to carry out his 
obligation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For his part, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> denied the existence of any oral agreement to build 
a house for the appellants and averred that the mortgage was made to secure the 
sum of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span>, which he loaned to appellants, and the 
further sum of P1,035.86, which he paid to the Luzon Surety Co. to discharge a 
prior lien on the mortgaged premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As special defenses, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> contended that the supposed oral agreement to build 
a house was unenforceable; that appellants' action was barred by prior judgment; 
and that appellants were <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the 
validity of the mortgage after they themselves had asked for its approval by the 
guardianship court in Special Proceedings No. 647. <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> filed a counter claim for P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> as attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellee's</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> special defenses are based on 
the fact that appellant Catalina <span class="SpellE">Pons</span> Calderon, as 
guardian of the other appellants, who are her children, had petitioned the 
guardianship court in Special Proceedings No. 647 for authority to mortgage her 
ward's property in order to secure a loan with which to build an apartment and 
thereby make the property productive. In its order of </span><st1:date year="1956" day="15" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 15, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
guardianship court granted the authority requested and approved the mortgage. 
This order is the basis of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> defense of <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> and 
<span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the hearing, appellant 
Catalina <span class="SpellE">Pons</span> Calderon testified but when asked 
questions tending to prove that appellants never received the amount of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> contrary to the recitals of the mortgage instrument and 
that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had agreed to build an apartment for 
appellants, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> counsel objected on the ground 
that the deed of mortgage was the best evidence and that appellant was <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from denying the validity of the mortgage. The 
trial court sustained the objection, whereupon appellants' counsel made an offer 
of proof and rested his case. <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> did not present 
evidence; instead he asked for the dismissal of the case. The lower court 
dismissed the case stating: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The due execution and 
genuineness of the deed of mortgage is not in dispute. The only question it 
appears is the issue of whether or not the guardian received the consideration 
of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> appearing in said deed. But even this 
question falls into insignificance because of the indubitable fact that said 
deed of mortgage has been regular. This is admitted by the parties. 
Consequently, the certificate of the Notary Public who ratified the document in 
question cannot also be questioned. And said Notary expressly stated that the 
plaintiffs Catalina <span class="SpellE">Pons</span> Calderon, as guardian of the 
minors Antonio P. Calderon and Milagros P. Calderon, and Luz Calderon and Elvira 
P. Calderon, acknowledged to him that the deed in question was their free and 
voluntary act and deed. Moreover the plaintiffs expressly acknowledged in the 
same document having received the sum of P15,000.00 in express words 'receipt of 
which is hereby acknowledged.' The certificate of the Notary has not been 
questioned. The plaintiffs can not now be heard to complaint that they have not 
received the consideration of the mortgage, and to allow it would be to 
overthrow the very admissions of regularity, and consequently, the sanctity of 
the said document. It results that the oral agreement alleged by the plaintiffs 
cannot be allowed to <span class="GramE">differ</span> the written agreement 
appearing in the real estate mortgage by means of testimonial evidence. Finally, 
the stamp of approval by the guardianship court on the document in question can 
lend no other meaning than the transaction was for a mortgage and no other, the 
consideration of which was duly received by the 
plaintiffs-mortgagors."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants' assignment of error 
centers on the refusal of the trial court to permit evidence on the supposed 
failure of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to pay the consideration of the 
mortgage and <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> alleged undertaking to finance 
the construction of an apartment on appellants' land. Thus they contend that 
under the ruling of <span class="SpellE">Maulini</span> v. Serrano, 28 Phil. 642 
(1914), <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence is admissible to show failure 
of consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="style5"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the other 
hand, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> argues that the issue is not whether 
appellants are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by the recitals of the 
mortgage instrument, but whether they are precluded by their conduct in seeking 
approval by the court of the mortgage deed in which they acknowledged receipt of 
P15<span class="GramE">,000</span>. In short, instead of instead of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by deed, the claim is that there is <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> in <span class="SpellE">pais</span><span class="GramE">.</span></span></span><span class="style21"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></sup></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span><sub style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></sup></span></sub><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We think the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is right. By asking the guardianship court So 
approve the mortgage, appellants must necessarily be deemed to have represented 
to the court that the mortgage was what it purported to be and they just not now 
be heard to say the contrary. It is true that in their motion, appellants merely 
stated that "Mr. Leonardo Medina [<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein] had 
agreed to advance the loan," but it must be remembered that at the time the 
motion was prepared the mortgage contract had not yet been executed. Thus the 
motion appears to have been prepared on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 5, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
while the deed of mortgage, in which receipt of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> 
is expressly acknowledged, on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="8" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 8, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
both motion and mortgage were submitted to the court on December 
12.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is true that in <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Maulini</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> v. Serrano,</span></em> supra, it was held that 
<span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence is admissible to prove failure of 
consideration but even if Catalina <span class="SpellE">Pons</span> Calderon had 
been allowed to testify and deny receipt of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span>, 
her testimony could not prevail over the recitals of the mortgage instrument. 
That instrument was ratified by the appellants, including Catalina <span class="SpellE">Pons</span> Calderon, before a notary public. As stated in one 
case, "if the biased and interested testimony of a grantor (witness Catalina 
<span class="SpellE">Pons</span> Calderon in this case) and the vague and 
uncertain testimony of his son are deemed sufficient to overcome a public 
instrument drawn up with all the formalities prescribed by the law then there 
will have been established a very dangerous doctrine which would throw wide open 
the doors to fraud." (El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino v. <span class="SpellE">Olviga</span>, 60 Phil. 17, 21 [1934]; MacDonald v. National City 
Bank, 99 Phil. 156, 162-163 [1956]) Nor would a mere denial of receipt suffice 
to contradict what appears in a clear and unequivocal manner in a public 
instrument. It was incumbent on appellants to prove their claim with "clear, 
convincing and more than merely preponderant evidence" (<span class="SpellE">Mendozona</span> v. Philippine Sugar Estates Dev. Co., 41 Phil. 475 
[1921]), which a mere denial cannot do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
