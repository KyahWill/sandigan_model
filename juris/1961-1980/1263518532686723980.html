				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals before on review contains
the decisive facts as well as the crucial question involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is not disputed that the lot in question (Lot No. 34-A) is a
part of a bigger parcel originally known as Lot No. 1060 (now Lot No. 34, Block
No. 5, <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span> Estate) which was leased to Vicente
Gonzalez by <span style="">the Roman Catholic </span>Archbishop
of Manila, the former owner of the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span> Estate;
that upon the death of Vicente Gonzales, he was succeeded by his only living
heir, Diego Gonzales, who continued with the lease contract; that sometime
thereafter, Diego Gonzales sold his leasehold <span style="">rights </span>over Lot No. <span style="">1060
as well as the improve</span>ments thereon to the plaintiff, Ricardo T. Franco,
[respondent in this Court] who thereupon took possession of the portion thereof
designated as Lot No. 34-B; and that <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz,
the <span style="">[petitioner's] </span><span style="">predecessor in interest, </span><span style="">had</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">been occupying the lot
in ques</span><span style="">tion (Lot No. 34-A) since
1926 as <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> of Diego Gonzales, the plaintiff's
predecessor in interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The question now </span>is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>''Who </span><span style="">between <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz [predecessor in interest
of petitioners] and the plaintiff [respondent in this Court] should be given
preference in the purchase of the lot in question from the Government?"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the decision now under review reversing <span style="">a </span>judgment of the lower court, the
answer given by the Court of Appeals failed to accord deference to the
authoritative principle, the latest formulation of which was in <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span> v. Court of Appeals,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where the right of a <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>
as an occupant was accorded due recognition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the appealed decision cannot stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the undisputed
facts, respondent Ricardo T. Franco would rely on the rights of Diego Gonzales,
from whom he acquired the leasehold rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the petitioners would base their claim as the
successor of one <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Cruz, who was a <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> of the aforesaid Diego Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As was pointed out in <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span> v. Court of Appeals, the opinion being penned by
Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The first issue involves a conflict of claims between a lessee and
a [<span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>] insofar as <span style="">the right to purchase the property is concerned.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several decisions of this Court have been cited and discussed by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, it may be noted
that in those cases the concept of possession by a <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>
under the Civil Code, which accordÂ­ing to the Court of Appeals in its decision
under review was in effect possession by the lessee <span class="SpellE">sublessor</span>,
was not considered by this Court applicable at all in construing the term
'occupant' under Commonwealth Act No. 539."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Reference was then made to the first section of Commonwealth Act
No. 539 authorizing the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to acquire private lands or any interest therein for the purpose of subdividing
the same into home lots or small farms for resale to <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> <span style="">tenants or occupants.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">noted in the <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span> opinion that in the first
case interpreting the above provision, Grande v. Santos,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court gave the right of preference to
the registered lessee, taking into consideration a number of circumstances
namely, that the lot was a small one of only 144 square meters and that to
subdivide the same into three portions would, owing to such extremely limited
size of each land, lead to frictions, conflicts, misunderstandings and possibly
disturbances of the peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Barely two weeks later that same year, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Marukot</span></span><span class="GramE"> v. Jacinto<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
was</span> decided, setting forth the now-prevailing doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was noted in the opinion of the then Chief
Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"As a matter of fact, there is no dispute that appellant Jacinto
was the lessee of the entire lot No. 35, who had paid rentals thereon prior to
the acquisition by the Government of the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span>
Estate; that since 1931, he has lived in his house built on his lot located in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; that the three <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Marukot</span>, Felipe
Balsa and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> have respectively occupied
lots 35-B, 35-D and 35-E, the first since 1940, the second since 1946, and the
third since 1944, and all the three have their own houses thereon and have been
paying rentals as <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> of appellant
Jacinto."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After which, came this portion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In
our opinion, the trial court did not err in giving judgment in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
necessary to decide herein whether a 'tenant' should enjoy priority over an
'occupant' who is a <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>, because the effect of
the appealed decision is to accommodate both; and this certainly cannot be said
to be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the intents and purposes of
Commonwealth Act No. 539. It is striking to note that appellant Jacinto even
gets about 300 square meters, or 100 square meters in excess of the total area
of the three lots awarded by the trial court to the three <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this affirmation as to who are <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupants
entitled to preference under the Act:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are unquestionably <u>bona</u>
<u>fide</u> occupants within the meaning of Commonwealth Act No. 539 because
they have their respective houses on the lots sublet to them by the tenant <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Jacinto; and there is absolutely no showing that they
were ordered to vacate either before or after the acquisition by the Government
of the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span> Estate."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span> opinion, in its review of
previous decisions, likewise referred to <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
v. Cruz,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
decided later in the month of that same year, where this Court, taking into
consideration that the <span class="SpellE">sublessees</span> did execute a
document expressly agreeing to vacate the lots anytime the tenant would so
require it, recognized the right of preference of the registered tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the above decision did not in any wise
impair the holding of <span class="SpellE">Marukot</span> v. Jacinto was made
clear in the opinion in <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span> v. Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"However, in the subsequent case of
Gutierrez vs. Santos, et al. (107 Phil. 419), the ruling in the Santiago
decision was clarified and given a restrictive application, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Now, we say that the above order of
preference should be observed if the parties affected stand on an equal footing
or under equal circumstances, for only in that way can the provision of the law
be implemented with equity, justice and fairness to all and in keeping with the
spirit of giving land to the landless so that he may have a land of his
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the order need not be rigidly
followed when a party, say a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> tenant, has already in his
name other lots more than what he needs for his family, for certainly to give
him the preference would work injustice to the occupants.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After such a view of the previous decisions, Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> in the same <span class="SpellE">Gongon</span>
decision announced the holding reached by this Court and the reason of public
policy that lies behind it:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the
case at bar it is not disputed that respondent spouses have their house on
another lot (lot No. 34, block No. 7) in the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span>
Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, respondent <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Rivera is the registered <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
tenant of still another lot, also in <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span>, with
an area of 2,761 square meters, which is considerably bigger than the lot in
question, where petitioner and his family constructed their residence and where
they have been living since 1934.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be said, therefore, that the parties herein stand on an equal footing or
under equal circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice and
equity command that petitioner be given the preferential right to purchase in
order to carry out the avowed policy of the law to give land to the
landless."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
So it should be in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier
set forth, the decision of the Court of Appeals cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fairness to the Court
of Appeals, it cannot be truly said that no effort was made to abide by the
controlling principle announced by us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, its decision sought to distinguish the facts of
this case from that deemed controlling in Gutierrez v. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The same thing cannot be said of the herein plaintiff who only has
Lot No. 34-B with an area of 338 square meters and a portion of 52 square
meters of the adjacent Lot No. 1059, or a total of 390 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a doctor by profession, he certainly
needs a more spacious lot to be able to keep up, if not to the demands of his
profession such as a clinic to accommodate his patients, at least to the needs
of his growing family."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While not entirely without basis, this Court does not deem the
above reason persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were
otherwise, then it would lead to manifesting an undue regard for the needs of a
medical practitioner and the standing a member thereof should possess as
against the claim of the several petitioners who, as found by the Court of
Appeals, have their house built on the disputed lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choice is not difficult, for justice and
equity, to follow the language of Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal's</span>
opinion, "command that [petitioners] be given the preferential right to
purchase in order to carry out the avowed policy of the law to give land to the
landless." As a matter of fact, as far back as August 11, 1951, the
predecessors in interest of petitioners did acquire the disputed lot under the
deed of sale executed by the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, the deed of sale having been subsequently registered, resulting in a
transfer certificate of title in favor of the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the
lower court, reversed by the Court of Appeals, dismissing the complaint of now
respondent Ricardo T. Franco, praying that the aforesaid deed of sale be
declared null and void, that the corresponding transfer certificate of title be
cancelled, or, in the alternative, for the petitioners to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
such property to the then Land Tenure Administration, which could execute the
corresponding deed of sale in favor of the plaintiff, now respondent Ricardo T.
Franco, could thus stand <span style="">the test of
the most exacting scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other
decision would be to render nugatory the fundamental purpose of Commonwealth
Act No. 539 and to that extent would amount to an assumption by the judiciary
of the authority to declare public policy <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the principle of separation of powers which places in the hands of Congress
the sole and uncontrolled discretion as to what it shall be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1967</st1:date> is reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against
