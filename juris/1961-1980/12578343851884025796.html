				<H3>SALVADOR L. CALO, PETITIONER VS. COURT OP APPEALS AND CASIANO C. PLAZA, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court &nbsp;of Appeals. <p>Petitioner Salvador L. Calo and respondent Casiano C. Plaza were candidates for the office of mayor of the City of &nbsp;Butuan &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;general elections held &nbsp;on November 10, 1959. &nbsp;Two (2) weeks later, or on November &nbsp;25, 1959, the Board of Canvassers of Butuan City proclaimed Calo elected with &nbsp;7,464 votes as against &nbsp;7,278 votes &nbsp;of &nbsp;Plaza his closest opponent, or a plurality of &nbsp;186 &nbsp;votes &nbsp;in &nbsp;favor of Calo. &nbsp;&nbsp; Soon thereafter, or &nbsp;on December 3, 1959, &nbsp;Plaza filed the corresponding election &nbsp; protest with &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of First Instance &nbsp;of &nbsp;Agusan, which, &nbsp;after &nbsp; appropriate proceedings, rendered judgment &nbsp;for &nbsp;Plaza, whom the &nbsp;court declared elected with 7,428 votes &nbsp;as against 7,402 &nbsp;votes credited &nbsp;to Calo, or a plurality of 26 votes in &nbsp;favor of Plaza. &nbsp;On appeal &nbsp;taken by both parties, a special division of the Court of Appeals, in a &nbsp;4 to &nbsp;1 &nbsp;decision, held that Plaza had been elected with a plurality of &nbsp;five (5) votes, and with this &nbsp;modification, affirmed the decision of the trial &nbsp; court, with costs against &nbsp;Calo. &nbsp;Hence this appeal by &nbsp;certiorari taken by the latter, &nbsp;who &nbsp;maintains that the Court of Appeals has committed eight &nbsp;(8) &nbsp;alleged errors discussed &nbsp;in his brief. &nbsp;We do not deem it necessary, however, to take up each one of &nbsp; said alleged errors for the reasons presently to be stated.</p> <p>Protestant's plurality &nbsp;of twenty-six &nbsp;(26) votes under the decision of the trial court was reduced by the Court of Appeals to five (5) &nbsp;votes, because &nbsp;the &nbsp;name &nbsp;written on the &nbsp;space for &nbsp;mayor in most of the ballots involved therein was "D.O. Plaza", and &nbsp; one of the candidates for Governor of the Province of Agusan was Democrito O. Plaza, and because the latter's nickname &nbsp;is &nbsp;"Monting" and &nbsp;the name written on said &nbsp;space &nbsp;in one (1) ballot (Exhibit 24-d) &nbsp;was "Monting &nbsp;Plaza", &nbsp;so &nbsp;that, the &nbsp;protestee &nbsp;contended, &nbsp;the &nbsp;candidate voted &nbsp;for was, &nbsp;not the protestant, &nbsp;but &nbsp;said Democrito &nbsp;O. Plaza. &nbsp;The protestee maintained, therefore, that &nbsp;these ballots should &nbsp;be &nbsp;considered as &nbsp;stray votes for mayor, but the Court of Appeals was not inclined to &nbsp;sustain this view, for the reason that the &nbsp;person voted for &nbsp;Governor &nbsp;in some of these ballots was, also, &nbsp;"D.O. Plaza", and that "Monting &nbsp;Plaza" &nbsp;was, also, the &nbsp;name &nbsp;written on the space for Governor in said Exhibit 24-d. &nbsp;The conclusion &nbsp;drawn therefrom by the &nbsp;Court &nbsp;of Appeals was that &nbsp;the voters who filled these ballots &nbsp;had in mind for mayor a person <i>other</i> than the one &nbsp;voted &nbsp;for &nbsp; Governor, which &nbsp;is clearly untenable, for, having written &nbsp;the &nbsp;<i>same name</i> in both spaces, the voter must be &nbsp;deemed &nbsp;to have intended &nbsp;the <i>&nbsp;same individual </i>, since identity &nbsp;of names necessarily connotes identity of persons, unless the contrary is satisfactorily established by &nbsp;competent &nbsp;evidence, and no such &nbsp;evidence has &nbsp;been introduced in the present case.</p> <p>This notwithstanding, the Court of &nbsp;Appeals concluded that even if the votes for "D.O. &nbsp; Plaza" &nbsp;and "Monting Plaza"—which, &nbsp;according to the appealed decision &nbsp;numbered twenty-one (21)-were deducted from those &nbsp;obtained by the protestant, the latter would still be the winner by five &nbsp;(5) votes. &nbsp;There are, &nbsp;however, a number of other ballots &nbsp; that have been erroneously counted &nbsp;for the protestant, &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;not counted &nbsp;for &nbsp;protestee &nbsp;Calo, &nbsp;to wit:</p> <ol type="1"><li>Exhibits 19-c, &nbsp;36-e, 57-b, 55-a, 15-d, 19-b, 67-F, 37-F, 44-b, 89-c and 70, or eleven (11) &nbsp;ballots, in which "D.O. Plaza" &nbsp;was, also, voted for &nbsp;mayor. &nbsp; These &nbsp;ballots should be &nbsp;considered as stray votes &nbsp;for mayor &nbsp;and &nbsp; deducted from the total number credited to Plaza by the Court of Appeals. &nbsp;Paragraphs &nbsp; (1) &nbsp;and &nbsp;(6) of Section 149 of the Revised Election Code read:<p></p> <blockquote> <p>"1. Any ballot where only the Christian name &nbsp;of candidate or only &nbsp;his surname appears &nbsp;is valid for such candidate if there is no other candidate with the same name or surname for the same office; but when the word &nbsp;written in the ballot is at the same time the Christian name of a &nbsp;candidate and the surname of his &nbsp;opponent, the vote shall be counted in favor of the latter."</p> <p>"6. The erroneous initial of the name which accompanies the correct &nbsp; surname of a candidate, the erroneous initial of the surname accompanying the &nbsp;correct name &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;candidate, or the &nbsp;erroneous intermediate &nbsp;initial between the correct name and surname of a candidate does not annul the vote in favor of the latter." </p> </blockquote> <p>are &nbsp;not in point. &nbsp;Paragraph (1) &nbsp;refers to &nbsp;the &nbsp; case when only the Christian name, &nbsp;or the surname, or &nbsp;one word, which is the Christian name of a candidate and &nbsp;the surname of his opponent, has &nbsp;been written &nbsp; by &nbsp;the voter. It &nbsp;does not &nbsp;apply when &nbsp;said &nbsp;word is &nbsp;<i> accompanied</i> &nbsp;by initials, as &nbsp;in the ballots above mentioned. &nbsp;&nbsp;Neither does paragraph &nbsp;(6) apply when the initial or initials and the surname written <i>are those of another candidate,</i> although for &nbsp;another office, inasmuch as &nbsp;the latter must be deemed to be the person voted for.</p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibits 41-b, 55-d and 7-e &nbsp;(3 ballots) should likewise, be considered, for the same reason, stray votes for mayor, instead of being counted for protestant &nbsp;Plaza, the name written on the &nbsp;space for mayor therein &nbsp;being "D. Plaza".<p></p> <p></p></li><li>We should similarly consider as stray votes for mayor Exhibits 56-d, &nbsp;44-b-l and 30-a (3 ballots) &nbsp;in which the persons voted for mayor &nbsp;are "D.O. Pleza", &nbsp;"D.O. Pesza" and &nbsp;"D. &nbsp;Palasas", respectively, tor, even if &nbsp;the surnames therein had been &nbsp; correctly written "Plaza", these ballots would not &nbsp;be in a better &nbsp;position &nbsp;than those involved in the &nbsp;preceding &nbsp;paragraphs, insofar as &nbsp;the &nbsp;protestant is concerned. <p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit 33-C-2 (1 ballot) in which the candidate voted for &nbsp;mayor is "D. B. Plasa", is substantially in &nbsp;the same condition as those heretofore &nbsp;discussed.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibits &nbsp;21-e, &nbsp;28-c, 57-f, &nbsp;20-f-2 and &nbsp;20-f-l &nbsp;(5 ballots), with pasted stickers bearing &nbsp;the printed name of persons, in &nbsp;which Plaza &nbsp;is voted &nbsp; for mayor, should be annulled as marked ballots &nbsp;(Section 149, &nbsp;paragraph &nbsp;14).<p></p> <p> </p></li><li>Exhibit 4-e, &nbsp;in which the name "Plaza" was written successively &nbsp;in the first &nbsp; four &nbsp;(4) spaces &nbsp;for &nbsp;Senators, and Exhibit 4-e-l, in which &nbsp;the voter wrote "D.O. &nbsp;Plaza" on &nbsp;the &nbsp;eight &nbsp;(8) spaces for Senators, apart &nbsp;from the space for Governor, and in both of which Plaza was voted for &nbsp;mayor, are, also, marked ballots, which &nbsp;(2 ballots) should be &nbsp;deducted from &nbsp;the &nbsp;votes credited to Plaza by the &nbsp; Court &nbsp;of Appeals.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit 59-d-l, in which Plaza is voted for mayor, should be &nbsp;annulled as &nbsp;a marked &nbsp;ballot, the voter &nbsp;having written &nbsp;on the fourth space for Senators the words "Mga lider &nbsp;sopsop &nbsp;elang tian &nbsp;guipaboro".<p></p> <p></p></li><li>The following thirteen (13) ballots should be counted for &nbsp;Calo, he having been &nbsp;voted therein for &nbsp;mayor. &nbsp;They were &nbsp;erroneously nullified &nbsp;by the trial &nbsp;court &nbsp;upon the ground &nbsp;that they are marked: </li></ol> <ol type="a"><li>Exhibit M—9, merely because, after filling the first space for &nbsp;members of the provincial board, the voter had written on &nbsp;the second space therefor a word that &nbsp;the trial court read as "vocales". &nbsp;It should be noted, however, that one of the candidates &nbsp;for member of &nbsp;the &nbsp;provincial board &nbsp;was &nbsp;"Morales", &nbsp;and that the penmanship of &nbsp;the voter is so poor &nbsp;that he could have actually intended to write &nbsp;"Morales" &nbsp;not "vocales". &nbsp;Moreover, this word is the &nbsp;Spanish term for &nbsp;members &nbsp;of the provincial board and the &nbsp;voter &nbsp;might not &nbsp;have &nbsp;been familiar with &nbsp;the equivalent &nbsp;in English of said term "vocales", so that he may have &nbsp;inserted &nbsp;this Spanish expression to indicate that the name &nbsp; written &nbsp;on said fiisst space was intended for "vocales", or members of &nbsp;the &nbsp;provincial board, and, hence, without the intent to mark or identify the ballot.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit EEEE-4, because the word written on &nbsp;the space &nbsp;for vice-mayor is "Conbaburd". &nbsp;&nbsp;This is not sufficient identification &nbsp;mark, in the absence &nbsp;of evidence <i> aliunde</i>, which &nbsp;has not been introduced. &nbsp;&nbsp;The voter was obviously unenlightened, judging from his poor spelling and handwriting.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit RRRR, because "E, CHEZ" appears &nbsp;written on the second space for councilors. &nbsp; The trial &nbsp;court did not state why it considered the ballot marked. &nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that "E, CHEZ" was written in &nbsp;block letters, like the name "PEREZ", appearing in the &nbsp;next lower space, unlike other names on &nbsp;the ballot, which were written in ordinary script, &nbsp;does not justify the action taken by &nbsp;the trial court &nbsp;(Sec &nbsp;149, par. 18). &nbsp;Besides there was a candidate for &nbsp;councilor &nbsp;by the name of &nbsp;Sanchez, and &nbsp;the voter appears to &nbsp;be of the unenlightened type.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit 1-6, because the vote for mayor is "Badong Calo-Nanong". &nbsp;The last term (Nanong) does not suffice to constitute an &nbsp;identification &nbsp;mark.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit &nbsp;S-8, because, &nbsp;after filling the &nbsp;space &nbsp;for Senators, provincial officiate, mayor &nbsp;and vice-mayor and the first space for councilors, the voter wrote, in the third space for councilors, &nbsp;the words "That's all", leaving &nbsp;the second and other spaces for &nbsp;councilors &nbsp;blank. &nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the voter merely &nbsp;wanted to indicate that he did not care to vote for more than one councilor.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit S-10, because, instead of writing the names of persons &nbsp;on the spaces for Senators, the &nbsp;voter wrote on the first space therefor the &nbsp;words "Grand Allaian". The intent to mark the ballot is far from clear. &nbsp;The voter may have meant to vote for the entire set of candidates for Senator of &nbsp;the political &nbsp;party known as &nbsp;Grand Alliance.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit 99-f-10, &nbsp;because &nbsp;the word &nbsp;written on the third space for councilors is &nbsp;"Air" &nbsp;or "Ais". &nbsp;Considering that this word may be considered <i>&nbsp;iden &nbsp; sonams</i> with "Asis", which is the surname &nbsp;of a candidate for councilor, the voter may have merely committed an error in spelling.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit V-4-d, because "sn &nbsp;B sanci" appears on the space for vice-mayor. &nbsp;The voter wrote, also, &nbsp;"di palsa" on the space for Provincial Governor, and "Ba &nbsp;Calo", on the space for mayor. &nbsp;These &nbsp;circumstances and his poor penmanship, as well as the fact &nbsp;that there was a &nbsp;candidate surnamed Sanchez, convince us that the voter had no intention to mark his ballot.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit VVV-6, because the name written on &nbsp;the space for mayor &nbsp;is "S Kato". However, "K" is used in many parts of the Philippines in lieu of "C". &nbsp;We note also, that the "t" in "Kato", is &nbsp;written like an "i", although with a horizontal bar at &nbsp;the top, &nbsp;and that the voter has a very poor &nbsp;handwriting &nbsp;&nbsp;Under &nbsp;the &nbsp;circumstances, &nbsp;said "Kato" may be considered <i>idem sonams</i> with &nbsp;"Calo".<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit ZZ-5, because the &nbsp;name written on the last space for councilors &nbsp;is &nbsp; "Martha". &nbsp;The intent to mark is not &nbsp;clear.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit QQQQ-3, &nbsp;because the &nbsp;name written, on the last space for councilors, is "Pasing". &nbsp;Without any &nbsp;evidence almnde on &nbsp;the intent &nbsp;to &nbsp;identify the &nbsp;ballot, said word is not enough to nullify &nbsp;the ballot as a &nbsp;marked one.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit PP-6, because "D.O. Plaza ako" is written on the space for Provincial Governor &nbsp;The term &nbsp;"ako" is &nbsp;not &nbsp;sufficient &nbsp;to nullify &nbsp;the &nbsp;ballot. &nbsp;&nbsp;The evident intent of the voter was,, obviously, to stress his desire to vote for Democrito &nbsp;O. &nbsp; Plaza for Provincial Governor.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>Exhibit GG-4, because &nbsp;it is written in ink. &nbsp;The trial court violated paragraph 10 of Section 149 of the Revised Election Code. </li></ol> <p></p> Recapitulating, we should, therefore, &nbsp;deduct 11 plus 3, plus 3, plus 1, plus 5, plus 2, plus 1, or altogether 26 votes, from the 7,407 votes counted in &nbsp;favor of Plaza by the Court of Appeals, &nbsp;thereby &nbsp;leaving a &nbsp;balance &nbsp;of &nbsp;7,381 &nbsp;votes in his favor. &nbsp;Upon &nbsp;the other hand, &nbsp;we &nbsp;must add thirteen (13) &nbsp;votes to the 7,402 votes &nbsp;credited to Calo by &nbsp;said Court, thereby increasing his votes to 7,415. As &nbsp;a consequence protestee Calo has won with a plurality of thirty four &nbsp;(34) &nbsp;votes &nbsp;over protestant Plaza. <p>Wherefore, the decision &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of Appeals &nbsp;and that of the Court &nbsp;of First Instance of Agusan are hereby reversed and &nbsp;another one shall be entered declaring that protestee Salvador L. Calo is the duly elected mayor for Butuan &nbsp;City, with &nbsp;costs against &nbsp;protestant &nbsp;Casiano C. Plaza. &nbsp;It is &nbsp;so &nbsp;ordered.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal</i>, JJ., &nbsp; concur.</p> </div>
