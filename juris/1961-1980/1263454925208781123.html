				<BR><STRONG>BARREDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for certiorari and prohibition (in G.R. No. L-30110) impugning the resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations in Case No. 1099-V to continue the trial of the case notwithstanding the pendency in this Court of G.R. No. L-27773 wherein petitioner herein sought to have the industrial court declared to be without jurisdiction over the claim of the members of private respondents on the ground that the same constituted money claims which should be filed in the special proceedings of the deceased Fortunato F. Halili against whom the case had been originally filed, and SECOND DIVISION (in Case G.R. No. L-38655) seeking the setting aside of respondent court's orders of December 14, 1973 (trial court) and April 30, 1974 (en banc) denying petitioner's request to be allowed to offer evidence against the report of the hearing examiner. By resolution of May 24, 1974, the Court required respondents to comment and ordered the issuance of a restraining order. After the corresponding comments and counter-comment were filed the Court called for a hearing on September 6, 1974, subsequently postponed to September 23, 1974. On January 8, 1975, the parties submitted the following: <p></p><p align="center"><strong>"JOINT MANIFESTATION AND MOTION </strong> </p><p>COME NOW the parties, assisted by counsel, and respectfully manifest:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>1. There has been pending in the Court of Industrial Relations since August 20, 1958 CIR Case No. 1099-V, entitled 'Halili Bus Drivers &amp; Conductors Union (PTGWO) vs. Fortunato F. Halili, doing business under the name and style 'Halili Transit' ’, which originated as a claim by a number of unnamed employees of Halili Transit for overtime compensation. In the ten years that the said case has been pending, the following relevant incidents have taken place therein:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(a) On August 7, 1961, the trial judge of the Court of Industrial Relations issued a Decision holding that certain operations performed by the union members-claimants in the case were legally compensable but not compensated, and ordering the Court Examiner to compute the amount due to the claimants under the decision.&nbsp; </p><p>(b) On February 26, 1968, this Honorable Court held in G.R. No. L-24864 that the aforesaid decision of the Court of Industrial Relations had become final and executory. For this reason, this Honorable Court denied the petition of the Administratrix of the estate of the late Fortunato F. Halili for the dismissal of the CIR Case (No. 1099-V) so as to enable the claimants to file their claims in the proper estate proceedings.&nbsp; </p><p>(c) Complying with the order of the Court of Industrial Relations to compute the liability of Halili Transit to the claimants on the basis of the guidelines "established by the said Court, the Court Examiner submitted his report dated April 28, 1972 in which the liability of Halili was placed at an aggregate amount of P3,812,039.55.&nbsp; </p><p>(d) Alleging, among others, that the guidelines on which the computation used by the Court Examiner were contrary to law, the Administratrix of the estate of Fortunato F. Halili, who is now also the Administratrix of the estate of his wife, elevated the case on certiorari to this Honorable Court through the instant case.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>2. In the course of the hearing on whether or not this petition was to be given due course by this Honorable Court, the Justices of this Division expressed their great concern at the fact that the case had been pending for so long without any relief having been given to the former employees and strongly urged the parties to arrive at some amicable settlement that would do substantial justice to the employees in order to forestall any further protraction of the case, particularly in view of the abolition of the Court of Industrial Relations, and yet not unduly cause hardship on the part of the heirs and estate of Fortunato F. Halili.&nbsp; </p><p>3. In the face of this strong urging on the part of this Honorable Court upon the parties to put an immediate end to the case by amicable settlement, the parties repeatedly came to conference, conscientiously explored all avenues of settlement, and finally arrived at an agreement embodied in the attached Memorandum of Agreement with Release and Quitclaim which is made a part hereof as Annex 'A'.&nbsp; </p><p>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is respectfully moved that the Memorandum of Agreement with Release and Quitclaim. Annex 'A', be approved by this Honorable Court and that CIR Case No. 1099-V be dismissed with prejudice."&nbsp; </p><p align="center">x x x x&nbsp; </p><p align="right">ANNEX "A"&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><strong>"MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT <br>&nbsp; WITH <br>&nbsp; RELEASE AND QUITCLAIM</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:&nbsp; </p><p>This Agreement, made and executed by and between -&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The ESTATE and Heirs of Fortunato F.

Benjamin C. Pineda;&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p align="center"><strong>W I T N E S S E T H</strong>&nbsp; </p><blockquote>WHEREAS, there has been pending in the Court of Industrial Relations since August 20, 1958 CIR Case No. 1099-V, entitled 'Halili Bus Drivers and Conductors Union (PTGWO) vs. Fortunato F. Halili, doing business under the name and style 'Halili Transit', which originated as a claim by a number of unnamed employees of Halili Transit for overtime compensation. In the ten years that the said case has been pending, the following relevant incidents have taken place therein: &nbsp; <p>1. On August 7, 1961, the CIR issued a Decision holding that certain operations performed by the petitioners laborers were legally compensable but not compensated, and ordering the Court Examiner to compute the amount due to the petitioner employees under the decision.&nbsp; </p><p>2. On February 26, 1968, the Supreme Court held in G.R. No. L-24864 that the aforesaid decision of the Court of Industrial Relations had become final and executory. For this reason, the Supreme Court denied the petition of the Administratrix of the estate of the late Fortunato F. Halili for the dismissal of the CIR Case (No. 1099-V) so as to enable the petitioner-employees to file their claims in the proper estate case.&nbsp; </p><p>3. Complying with the order of the Court of Industrial Relations to compute the liability of Halili Transit to the petitioner-employees on the basis of the guidelines established by the said court, the Court Examiner submitted his report dated April 28, 1972 in which the liability of Halili was placed to aggregate P3,812,039.55.&nbsp; </p><p>4. Alleging that the guidelines on which the computation used by the Court Examiner were contrary to law, the Administratrix of the estate of Fortunato F. Halili, who is now also the Administratrix of the estate of his wife, elevated the case to the Supreme Court on certiorari in G.R. No. L-38655.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>WHEREAS, in the course of the hearing on whether or not the Petition in G.R. No. L-38655 was to be given due course by the Supreme Court, the Justices of the Second Division expressed their great concern at the fact that the case had been pending for so long without any relief having been given to the employees. The good Justices then strongly urged the parties to arrive at some amicable settlement that would do substantial justice to the employees in order to forestall any further protraction of the case, particularly in view of the imminent abolition of the Court of Industrial Relations. The Supreme Court has to date abstained from giving due course to the Petition in the case thereby putting the parties on continuing pressure to find some amicable settlement that would do substantial justice to the employees and yet not unduly cause hardship on the part of the heirs and estate of Fortunato F. Halili.&nbsp; </p><p>WHEREAS, in the face of this strong urging on the part of the Supreme Court Justices upon the parties to put an immediate end to this case by amicable settlement, the parties repeatedly came to conference, conscientiously explored all avenues of settlement, and finally arrived at the tentative agreement (tentative because of the condition that the same be sanctioned by the court in the estate case) whereby the Adminis­tratrix would transfer to the employees title to that tract of land, covered by TCT No. 36389, containing an area of approximately 33,952 square meters, situated in the Barrio of San Bartolome, Municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, and pay in addition the cash amount of P25,000.00 in full and final satisfaction of all the claims and causes of action of all of the employees against the estate of Fortunato F. Halili, subject of CIR Case No. 1099-V.&nbsp; </p><p>"WHEREAS, in an Order, dated December 17, 1974, a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Annex 'A', the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, Branch IV has approved in Sp. Proc. No. Q-10852, the motion of the administratrix of the estate of Fortunato F. Halili to enter into an amicable settlement with the petitioners in CIR Case No. 1099-V under the terms and conditions hereunder stipu­lated.&nbsp; </p><p>NOW THEREFORE, for and in conside­ration of the foregoing and of the covenants, stipulations and undertakings hereinafter con­tained, the parties have agreed as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>1.
