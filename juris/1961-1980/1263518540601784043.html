<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">For the above-mentioned death of Norberto

then a detention prisoner in the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> municipal

<p class="BODY">Through witness JUANITO BAUTISTA<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>, the
prosecution tried to establish that in the early morning of 29 September 1962,
the accused July <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span> woke up to find his polo
shirt thrown out of the men's cell and the twenty pesos allegedly placed inside
the pocket of said shirt missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suspecting
that these acts were committed by Norberto <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, a
mentally deranged person who was confined in the jail for safe keeping, <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span> confronted Norberto about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when Norberto denied the acts imputed to
him, <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span> dragged him to the women's cell which
is adjacent to the men's cell where both were confined, and there boxed Norberto
in the stomach several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result of this beating, Norberto lost consciousness and collapsed to the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the accused filled a
candy-can with water in the bathroom (which adjoins the men’s cell), and poured
it on the face of Norberto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
Norberto regained consciousness, the accused forced him to drink water from the
can, and then jumped on the stomach of the prostrate Norberto until blood and
water came out of his nose and mouth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not content with this, the accused raised Norberto's body to a standing
position and knocked his head against the cement wall several times.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After that, the accused left Norberto lying on the floor and returned to his bunk
in the men's cell.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
While Norberto was being maltreated by the accused, <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>, another jail inmate, tried to intervene,
but <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> had to desist because he was warned by
the accused that he (<span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>) would be maltreated
next.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning or
probably an hour after the incident, <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> found
Norberto dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, Boy <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, another inmate, called for the guard, Patrolman
Torres, and informed him of Norberto's death.</p>

<p class="BODY">JAIME AQUINO, also a detention prisoner on the day in question,
testified for the prosecution as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="9">29
 September 1962</st1:date>, the accused July <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span>
confronted the deceased Norberto <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> in connection
with the loss of <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana's</span> money in the pocket of
his polo shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Norberto denied
having taken the money, <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span> started beating
Norberto (right in the men's cell) with the wooden handle of a broom until it
broke.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, the accused brought Norberto to the women's cell, tied the latter's hand
to the iron bar of a bed, and boxed him in the abdomen.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
When the accused saw that Norberto was already weak, he untied his hands and
Norberto slid to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the
accused went to the bathroom, filled a candy-can with water, held Norberto by
the nape and poured water into his mouth.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Afterwards, the accused put Norberto down and jumped on the latter's
stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused made a second trip
to the bathroom, filled the can once more with water, returned to the women's
cell, poured water into Norberto's mouth, and jumped again on Norberto's stomach.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Having done this, the accused left and went back to his bunk and slept.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
This witness further testified that when the accused woke up, he returned to
the place where Norberto was, pulled the latter up to his feet and knocked his
head against the cement wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
seeing that blood was oozing from the nose of Norberto, the accused brought him
to the bathroom, cleansed him, and then left him lying on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after the accused had returned to
his bunk that <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>, another inmate and the
witness carried Norberto back to the women's cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Norberto was then still alive.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Later, the witness checked on the condition of the maltreated man, and finding
that Norberto was already dead, he called for the guard and informed him of the
matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also placed DIOSDADO MANALOTO on the stand, who
testified that, being a trusty, he was not in the men's cell when the alleged
maltreatment of Norberto <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> took place, and that
he saw Norberto only when he was asked by the authorities to help bring the
dead body out of the cell.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Understandably, therefore, this witness was taken out of the witness stand at
the instance of the prosecution, for being a hostile witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman WILFREDO TORRES of the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
Police Department declared in court that he was the guard on duty in the
municipal jail from 6 A.M. to 12 noon, and from 6 P.M. to 12 midnight of 29
September 1962; that at 6:02 in the morning of that day, he made a head count
of the jail-inmates, and Norberto <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> was then
still alive, sitting near the wall of the main (men's) cell;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The Municipal Health Officer, DR. JOSE VILLAFLOR, who performed

incepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this condition of the
body, he calculated that death must have come to the deceased between 3 to 6

in the morning of that day.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying for the defense, the accused JULY LACSAMANA declared
that at about 3 o'clock in the morning of 29 September 1962 he was awakened by

Norberto near the entrance to the men's cell, his outstretched arms (probably
inserted between the bars) being pulled by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Baun</span> and Sgt.

that Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Baun</span> left and when he returned, said
policeman was carrying a club; that Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Baun</span>
then thrust this club again and again into the belly of Norberto, who jerked

him<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>;
that when Sgt. Perez noticed that he and the other inmates were awake, they
were told that Norberto was about to kill them without their knowledge; that
Sgt. Perez showed them the placard made of iron sheet, usually placed atop the
door of the cell, with which Norberto allegedly tried to cut their necks;<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
that when Norberto's cries abated, the accused went back to sleep; that he was
roused again by the noise made by his cell-mates who were cleaning the cell<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>;
that after the guard had made the morning physical count of the prisoners , he

that later, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> told Boy <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>

that after the municipal health officer who was called by the guard had ordered
the removal of the body of the deceased from the jail, Sgt. Perez passed by and
instructed them to tell the investigators that Norberto fell from the bicycle
that was deposited in the women's cell<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>;

According to the accused, he wrote to the Municipal Mayor and the Municipal
Attorney, with the intention of revealing to them what he knew of Norberto's
death; however, the mayor did not come.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Municipal Attorney came, but only to offer his pro­fessional

floor of the municipal building; that when said municipal health officer, who
responded at once to the call of the guard, arrived in the jail, <u>rigor
mortis</u> had already started on the dead body, thus leading him to conclude
that Norberto must have been dead for three to six hours before he was called;
that the deceased sustained both external and internal injuries, and the death
could have been caused by the internal injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since witnesses were positive that Norberto
was still alive when the physical count of the prisoners was made at <st1:time minute="2" hour="18">6:02</st1:time> that morning,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
the only conclusion that can be made is that he must have died between <st1:time minute="2" hour="18">6:02</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00</st1:time>
in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questions to be
asked now are, who inflicted the injuries that caused his death, and when were
they inflicted?</p>

<p class="BODY">In sustaining the prosecution and holding the accused guilty as
charged, the trial judge relied solely on the testimonies of alleged eyewitnesses
<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Bautista and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
former detainees in the muni­cipal jail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon a diligent and painstaking scrutiny of the prosecution evidence, we
can not agree with the trial court on the weight to be given the testimonies of
witnesses Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Bautista, the maltreatment of
the deceased by the accused appellant, consisting in the infliction of blow to
the stomach, the pouring of water in the mouth, the stamping or jumping on the
stomach of the victim, and the knocking or banging of his head against the
cement wall, was one continuous and un­interrupted action the took place only
in the women's cell.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
After that, the accused retired to his bunk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As narrated by witness <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, on the other
hand, the manhandling of the deceased commenced in the men's cell and ended in
the women's cell; that the deceased was not only boxed in the stomach, he was
also beaten with the handle of a broom, forced to take water and then jumped on
<span class="SpellE">on</span> the stomach, then his head was banged against the
wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The maltreatment, according to
this witness, was not continuous, but was carried out in two phases, with the
accused finding time to sleep in between.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The witness even declared that the accused brought the deceased to the
bathroom presumably to wash off the blood from the latter's face, and then left
him there lying on the bathroom floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Note that the beating with the broom handle and the interval of sleep by
the accused, and the subsequent bringing of the deceased to the bathroom to be
washed, were never mentioned by the first witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inconsistency in the accounts by two
alleged eyewitnesses of the incident that supposedly occurred in their
presence, and within the confines of the enclosure where they were, can not but
create doubt as to their truthfulness and sincerity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And such conflicts in their court versions
can not simply be dismissed as natural or trivial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is not everyday that one sees a person
being forced to take in water and jumped on <span class="SpellE">on</span> the
stomach until blood and water come out of his mouth and nose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidents of this nature should have
attracted more than passing attention and observation of the spectators, so
that if they indeed happened, they would have brought about a more or less
similar account, at least of the manner in which they were carried out, from
the onlookers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> that
after manhandling the deceased the accused found time to sleep in his bunk only
to resume the maltreatment after the nap, all between 6:02 and 7:00 in the
morning of 29 September 1962, is inherently improbable and provokes disbelief,
particularly considering that prosecution witness Bautista asserted that when <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> peeped through the bars of the cell the alleged
maltreatment had ended (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pages 87-88, Session
of 11 July 1963).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, both witnesses testified that while the
accused was abusing the deceased, only <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> tried to intercede with the accused or his
behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>
belied this evidence, testifying that he, being a trusty, did not sleep in the
prison cells (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="8">28 August 1963</st1:date> pages 4-5)</p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, the rest of the more than 30 inmates of the jail were
either looking, or making drawings,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
or reading comic books, or telling stories in boisterous or loud voices,<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
according to the prosecution "eyewitnesses".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that these inmates were
accustomed to sights of violence, or that they were indeed afraid of the
accused, it runs counter to the pattern of behavioral reactions of human beings
that they should just watch, o continue drawing or telling stories, while a
helpless mentally deranged individual is being beaten up, without anybody even
trying to call the attention of the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What makes this more in­credible is that the
maltreated man should not have screamed or called for aid, when the office of
the Chief of Police is merely adjacent to the jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The door of the men's cell, according to the
evidence, is only about 5 meters away from the door of the office of the Police
Chief.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
It is also highly unlikely that an incident involving the manhandling of a
person should not have attracted the notice of any one in the municipal
building, considering that it supposedly happened after <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, and after the guard had counted
the prisoners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, no motive has been shown why witnesses Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> would contrive lies that might send the accused to
death or to a long stretch of prison years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the absence alone of such motive to prevaricate would not make an
otherwise improbable and incredible declaration true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the improbability of the testimonies of
these witnesses is further exposed by the prosecution's own evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the findings of the municipal health
officer (Exhibit "A", negative the prosecution's theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution witnesses asserted that aside
from the blows thrown by the accused against the stomach of the deceased, the
former further stepped or jumped thereon while the latter was lying prostrate
face up on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that had been
so, the marks left by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> fists or by his
feet would have appeared in the <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span>
region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet none were found there, but
in the <u>lumbar</u> region of the victim's body.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
These marks are thus left unexplained in the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">The flaws in the evidence of the prosecution above pointed to,
that make such evidence weak and incredible, sufficiently raise a reasonable
degree of doubt as to the probability of the occurrence of the incident as
presented by the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be
observed that the unusual features attending the alleged crime, to wit, the
non-intervention and indifference of the fellow prisoners, and the failure of
any prison guard to appear while the maltreatment was in course, are more
consistent with the version of appellant, that the deceased was maltreated by
police officers and not by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the circumstances, We certainly can not return a verdict of guilt against the
accused for the crime for which he has been prosecuted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the offense charged against him not having been
proved beyond reasonable doubt, the accused appellant is hereby acquitted
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision appealed from is
reversed, without costs.</p>
