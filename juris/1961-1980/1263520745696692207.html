				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For the satisfaction of a final judgment for damages rendered by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch IV) <span style="">in its </span>Civil Case No. Q-2171 (<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span style="">Flores, </span>et
al. vs. Petra Evangelista, <span style="">et al.), </span>the
judgment creditors caused the levy on execution of a parcel of land more par­ticularly
described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A PARCEL OF LAND, located at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bayanbayanan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bounded
on <span style="">the </span>North by property <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
Gregorio; on the South <span class="SpellE">Callejon</span>; on the East <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> St., and on the West by <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
River, with an area of 439.37 square meters, more or less, with an as­sessed
value of P880.00 together with all the improvements thereon with an as­sessed
value of P1<span class="GramE">,800.00</span>, with a total assessed value of
P2,680.00, covered by Tax Declaration No. 10252."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">then</span> declared
for taxation purposes in the names of the judgment debtors, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petra Evangelista and her children Nita,
Priscilla, Ernesto, <span class="SpellE">Amalia</span> and Carmen, all surnamed
Guevara.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These judgment debtors are the
widow and children, respectively, of the deceased David Guevara, <span class="GramE">whose</span> negligence, as found by the trial court in civil case
No. Q-<span class="GramE">2171,</span> caused the death and injury of several
persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
scheduled the auction sale of the property levied upon on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But prior thereto the brothers and sisters of
the deceased David Guevara, together with the judgment debtors, sought to
prevent the sale at public auction by staking third-party claims, asserting
rights of ownership by way of inheritance over a ten-eleventh portion of the
parcel of <span style="">land </span>levied upon and
one-half of the value of the house situated thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On account, however, of an indemnity bond
posted by <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Flores, one of the judgment
creditors, the provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> proceeded
with the auction sale, at which said <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Flores
was the successful bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Im­mediately
thereafter <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Flores assigned his right as such
purchaser to <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>,
the judgment creditors own counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The judgment debtors in civil case No.</span>
Q-2171 having failed to redeem the property within the one-year period <span style="">for </span>redemption, the provincial sheriff
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> executed in favor of <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
Flores an "Officer's Deed of Absolute <span style="">Sale" dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="1"><span style="">January </span>4, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
Flores moved in the court below for a writ of possession directing the judgment
debtors "to vacate the above-described property or relinquish possession
of the same to <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Flores, his heirs,
representatives and assigns." This was opposed by the judgment debtors,
who pointed out that the parcel of land sold at the execution sale was owned
and possessed by the <span style="">third-party
claimants who had filed their claim with </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">provincial sheriff
and, in fact, had earlier brought the corresponding action in court (Civil Case
No. 7720, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Br. X) to
vindicate the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opposition was
overruled; the court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u><span style=""> granted the writ of possession prayed for and accordingly directed the
pro­vincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to place <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Flores and/or his representative in possession of
the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the pro­vincial
sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was unable to enforce the writ of
possession due to the resistance of the third-party claimants, who had
meanwhile taken possession by virtue of their claim of ownership over the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="3">March
 23, 1965</st1:date>, the lower court served notice upon the third-party
claimants to vacate the premises in question on or before <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>, on pain of being punished for
contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter they and the
judgment debtors came to this Court on the instant petition for prohibition
with preliminary injunction, principally to prevent enforcement of the
aforementioned "writ of possession".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>
this Court issued the writ of preliminary injunction asked for, enjoining
respondents . . ." from enforcing the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="3">March 23, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, in Civil Case No. </span>Q-2171 (<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Flores, et al. vs. <span style="">Petra Evangelista, et al.) of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, for the purpose of preserving the rights of the
parties to the case, until further orders from this Court."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue here <span style="">is </span>whether
or not under the facts the third-party claimants' assertion of ownership over a
portion of the land sold on execution may defeat the purchaser's right to have
possession of the same after the expiration of the one-year redemption period
allowed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 35 of Rule 39
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(I<span class="GramE">)f</span>
no redemption be made within twelve (12) months after the sale, the purchaser
or his assignee </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">entitled to a conveyance and possession of
the property (sold on execution);. . ." This, of course, is on the
assumption that the property belonged to the judgment debtor or to one who
claims under him as his successor after the execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">". . . </span>As the
purchaser in the present case has x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> already received
the definitive deed of sale and become the owner of the property bought, he
should be entitled to its possession <span style="">and
cannot be excluded <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by one, who, according
to the same complaint, merely claims to be a 'successor in interest of the judgment
debtor', unless it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">adjudged that this
alleged successor has a better right to the property than the purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such adjudication, however would at this
stage of the proceedings be premature and without basis." (<span class="SpellE">Belleza</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Zan­daga</span>, et al., 98
Phil. 702)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Would such right to possession be defeated by the fact that a
third party, not privy to the judgment debtor, claims to be the owner of the
same property?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that
"where a parcel levied upon execution is oc­cupied by a party other than a
judgment debtor, the pro­cedure is for the court to order a hearing to
determine the nature of said adverse possession" (<span class="SpellE">Saavedra</span>,
et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Siari</span> Valley Estates, Inc., et al., 106
Phil. 432, 436; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <span class="SpellE">Omaña</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Gatulayao</span>, 73 Phil. 66; <span class="SpellE">Gozon</span> vs.
De la Rosa, 77 Phil. 919; Santiago vs. Sheriff of Manila, 77 Phil. 740).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a hearing, however, was not necessary in
this case for two reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="GramE">The</span> third <span style="">party-claimants
here were not in possession of the disputed land </span>when it was sold at
public auction on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1963</st1:date>,
pursuant to the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
the judgment-debtors' own admission in their opposition to the motion for a
writ of possession, the third-party claimants occupied the said land only after
they had commenced Civil Case No. 7720 on June 10, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were not in possession when they filed
their third-party claim on <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="2">February
 13, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) When the land
was levied upon and when it was sold on execution it was declared for taxation
in the names of the judgment debtors, who were the ones then in posses­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite obviously the third-party claimants'
belated move to take possession was designed to defeat the purchaser's right to
the same in accordance with the pro­vision of Section 35 of Rule 39, by virtue
of the definite deed of sale in his favor, which may be defeated and set aside
only by an adverse final adjudication against him of the third parties' claim
of ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The said claim is not
foreclosed by the writ </span>of possession issued by the lower court, being
precisely the subject of litigation in Civil Case No. 7720 of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the issuance of such writ was proper,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> acted within its jurisdiction when it poised the
threat of contempt against any willful defiance thereof by the third-party
claimants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the petition is dismissed and the writ of
preliminary injunction heretofore issued is dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against petitioners.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
