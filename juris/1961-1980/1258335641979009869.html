<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal, taken 
by plaintiffs Esteban M. <span class="SpellE">Sadang</span> and his wife Maria 
<span class="SpellE">Lachica</span>, from a decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila dismissing their complaint, with costs against 
them.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Plaintiffs obtained from the 
Government Service Insurance System a loan of P144<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, on </span><st1:date month="9" day="13" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 13, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
an additional loan of P29,000.00, on </span><st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 11, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
payable, with interest, on installments. To guarantee the payment thereof, 
plaintiffs constituted a real estate mort gage on a parcel of land, belonging to 
them, situated in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and more particularly described 
in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 22386 of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in their name. Upon their 
default in the payment of some of the amortizations provided in the principal 
obligation, and the interest as well as the surcharges stipulated therein, 
despite repeated demands, defendant asked the Sheriff of Manila to extra 
judicially foreclose said mortgage, as agreed upon by the parties. After 
publishing the corresponding notice of sale in the newspaper "<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila", the aforementioned property was, on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="2" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 2, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
sold at public auction to the defendant as the highest bidder. Soon thereafter, 
or on January 11, 1960, the defendant applied for a writ of possession, which 
was granted, without any opposition thereto, on January 16, 1960, upon the 
filing of the corresponding bond by the defendant, which took possession of said 
property on November 10, 1960. Almost two (2) years later, or on 
</span><st1:date month="9" day="8" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 8, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
plaintiffs filed the present action, in the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
to annul the aforementioned sale and recover damages, upon the ground that the 
newspaper "<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila" is not of general 
circulation and that the notice of sale had not been published for three (3) 
consecutive weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After appropriate proceedings, 
said court rendered a decision dismissing the complaint, with costs against the 
plaintiffs, who, thereupon, interposed this appeal directly to the Supreme 
Court, upon the ground that the property in question is worth more than 
P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Plaintiffs maintain that the 
aforementioned sale at public auction is null and void <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ab</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">initio</span> </span></em>upon 
the theory that the newspaper "<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila" is not 
of "general circulation" and that publication of the corresponding notice of 
sale once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks has not been sufficiently 
established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In connection with the last 
issue, the customary affidavit of the editor of the "<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila" to the effect that said notice had been 
published in said newspaper on October 29, and November 5 and 12, 1959, was duly 
introduced in evidence, and constitutes <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">prima facie</span></em> evidence of said fact. 
There being no competent evidence to the contrary, and considering that, as the 
party alleging non-compliance with the requisite publication, plaintiffs had the 
burden of proving said allegation, it is apparent that the same has not been 
substantiated. The cases of Campo vs. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> (38 
Phil. 808), <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span> vs. Arguelles (57 Phil. 317) and 
<span class="SpellE">Borja</span> vs. </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Addison</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (44 Phil. 895), cited by the 
plaintiffs, refer to sales made without the notice required by law. 
Consequently, they are inapplicable to the present case, said notices having 
been given therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As regards the question whether 
the newspaper "<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila" is of general 
circulation or not, plaintiffs allege that said newspaper had never been 
registered with the Bureau of Commerce; that it was not accepted by the public; 
that there had been several interruptions in its publication from 1945 to 1961; 
that several offices of the Government and universities had never subscribed 
thereto or were not subscribed thereto in 1959; that, after June 30, 1959, the 
"<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila" had not submitted any report to the 
Bureau of Census and Statistics; and that a money judgment rendered against said 
newspaper in 1952 was still unsatisfied in 1959. The lower court had, however, 
the following to say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This Court can say that at the 
time of its publication, '<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila' was edited in 
Spanish and was generally read by persons who understand said language, 
especially at the time, as it is now, when newspapers in Spanish were quite rare 
in the City of Manila. '<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila’, as a 
newspaper, contained news of general interest and character to the community and 
at the time of its publication, it used to carry court notices, notices of 
extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgages and notices of public sales of mortgaged 
property by the Sheriff of Manila, as well as by Sheriffs of the different 
provinces in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Consequently, the fact, as 
contended by the plaintiffs, that some universities and colleges did not have 
copies of said newspaper in their files, is no proof that ‘<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila' was not a newspaper of general circulation 
for it can be stated as a fact that it being in Spanish, its contents could not 
be of interest to university students who have hardly a working knowledge or 
understanding of the Spanish language as the mode of instruction in almost all 
the universities and colleges is in English."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon a review of the record, we 
are not prepared to disturb the foregoing finding of fact, which, in our 
opinion, is substantially correct. Moreover, admittedly, plaintiffs had been 
notified by the Sheriff that the mortgaged property would be sold at public 
auction on December 2, 1959, at 10:00 a.m., at the main entrance of the City 
Hall of Manila; the sale took place on said date, and at said time and place; 
over a month after the sale, or on January 11, 1960, defendant filed a motion 
for a writ of possession, to which plaintiffs did not object; the corresponding 
writ of possession was issued on January 16, 1960; and, on November 10, 1960, 
the property in question was actually delivered to the defendant, without any 
opposition on their part, either at that time or within the next twenty-two (22) 
months preceding the commencement of the present action. Since, it is presumed 
that official duty has been regularly performed and that the ordinary course of 
business has been followed (Rule 13, Section 5 [m] and [q], Rules of Court), we 
must assume that plaintiffs were notified of defendant's motion for a writ of 
possession, of the order of the court granting said motion and of the very fact 
of delivery of possession to the defendant. Plaintiffs’ inaction during this 
period of time constitutes a waiver of such objection as they may have had to 
the foreclosure sale predicated upon the theory that the newspaper "<span class="SpellE">Voz</span> de Manila" is not of general circulation and bars their 
present action based upon said theory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE,</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the decision appealed from is 
hereby affirmed, and this appeal being manifestly frivolous, plaintiffs and 
their counsel are hereby sentenced, jointly and severally, to pay treble costs 
(Rule 142, Section 3, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of 
Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IT IS SO 
ORDERED.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
