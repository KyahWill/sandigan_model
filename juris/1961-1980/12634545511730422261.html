				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>plaintiff, as
insurer-<span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>, brought <span style="">this </span>action to recover the sum of
P4,305.55, representing the value of partially damaged shipment of 351 cartons
of medicine consigned to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Philex</span></span><span style=""> Mining </span>Corporation, against the
Manila Port Service and the Manila Railroad Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span style="">a </span>trial,
the Court of First Instance of Manila sentenced the defendants, jointly and
severally, to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P4,305.55, plus attorney's fees
of <span style="">P500.00, </span>and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants interposed this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts set forth in the stipulation of facts submitted by
the parties, it appears that the <span class="SpellE">Philex</span> Mining
Corporation of Manila was the consignee of 351 cartons of medicine shipped on
board the SS "Japan Bear".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
<span style="">merchandise were contained in four
cargo vans </span>owned by the carrier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The shipment, which was insured with the Insurance Company of <st1:place>North
 America</st1:place> against all risks of loss and damage, arrived at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1961</st1:date>, and the
cargo vans containing the merchandise were discharged in <u>good</u> <u>order</u>
unto the custody of the Manila Port Service on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1961</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The padlock and key to the cargo vans containing the shipment were left with
the operators of the vessel.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1961, the consignee requested the agent of the
shipping company to open the cargo <span style="">vans,
</span>and it was found that 50 cartons of the shipment of medicine were
wet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon request of the consignee, the
50 cartons were examined and findings <span style="">of
said examination are contained in "Bad Order Examination Report No.
2023" </span>dated July 19, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the exception of the damaged cartons adverted to, the whole
shipment was delivered in good order and acknowledged <span style="">as </span>such by the consignee thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Provisional claim for damage and/or <span style="">loss was </span>filed by the consignee against the defendants <span style="">on </span>June <span style="">27, </span>1961, one day before the discharge of the goods from the
carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Formal claim was,
however, filed on July 31, 1961, specifically for <span style="">the value of the 50 cartons </span>which were damaged, in the amount of
P4,305.55.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contractor denied the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Insurance Company of North America, <span style="">as </span>insurer,
paid the consignee the amount of P4,700.86.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts agreed upon by the parties, the lower court
rendered decision against the defendants holding that at the time the goods
were damaged, they were no longer on board the carrier but inside the premises
of the Manila Port Service, under the care and custody of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the defendants-appellants first contend that the
mere receipt by the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> con<span style="">tractor of the four
cargo vans in question did not make it responsible and liable for the damages
to the contents thereof, arguing that the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contractor, although charged with the duty and function of receiving, handling,
caring for, and delivering the merchandise, does not warrant, insure, or
guarantee the contents of packages, cases or boxes </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">cargo received by it from the carrying </span><span style="">vessel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
defendants-appellants' theory cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied that the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contractor had received and had taken custody of the cargo vans </span><span style="">containing </span><span style="">the goods in question upon their discharge
from the carrier on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> <u>in</u> <u>good</u>
<u>order</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court has found
as a fact, that on the delivery of the cargo vans to the piers, the exterior
portion of the vans were not even wet, otherwise, a notation would have been
made on the tally sheet of such defect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having taken custody of the cargo vans from the time of their discharge
from the carrier until their delivery to the consignee, the
defendants-appellants, in disclaiming responsibility for any damage to the
goods contained therein, is bound </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">establish by evidence that either the 50 cartons of
the shipment were already damaged when they were unloaded from the vessel, or
that the damage was not in any way imputable to it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Without proof to
support either alternative, the conclusion is inevitable that the damaged
condition of the goods was due to </span><span style="">a cause </span><span style="">for which the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contractor is answerable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Untenable is
the proposition that the vessel owner should be held liable because the
operators thereof had the keys to the cargo vans containing the shipment before
it was examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing,
and neither is it claimed, that the cause of the damage was the <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> of the keys or that the damage could have been
avoided were the </span><span style="">keys </span><span style="">entrusted to the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contractor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisive factor in the determination of
who should be responsible for the damage </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not possession of the keys but custody of the
goods at the time the damage was incurred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second question posed
<span style="">is </span>whether or not the claim for
the value of the damaged goods was filed within the fifteen-day period required
in the management contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are in
accord with <span style="">the defendants-appellants
that the lower court committed error in holding that the provisional claim
filed </span>by the consignee on June 27, 1961, one day before the discharge of
the goods from the carrying vessel, complies with the provisions of the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a number of cases,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span style="">this
Court has nullified </span>such claims as being premature and speculative, for
they do not serve the purpose for which they are intended - to afford the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">"reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim, while
the facts are still fresh in the minds of the person who took part in the
transaction and while the pertinent documents are <span style="">still available."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants
contend </span><span style="">further that the claim
for loss or damage was filed beyond the 15-day, period provided in the
management contract, because from June 28, 1961, when the four vans were
discharged from the vassal, until July 31, of the same year, when </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">formal claim for loss was filed, more than
fifteen days had elapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The clause in the
management contract providing that the claim shall be filed within fifteen days
from the date of discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel, is in
the <span style="">nature of a p</span></span>eriod of
limitation for bringing an action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
a defense within the privilege of the defendant to avail of, or to waive it,
such <span style="">a </span>defense
being personal to the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
serve <span style="">as a </span>legal
<span style="">ground </span>to bar or defeat an
action, it must be pleaded and proved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the burden of proof rests on the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, the claim of the consignee or <span style="">its </span><span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
for loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> <span style="">and/or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> </span>of
goods, must be presented to the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contractor
within fifteen days from the date of discharge of the last package from the
carrying vessel, as provided in the <span style="">management </span>contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule applies where, <span style="">ordinarily, the
consignee or </span><span style="">claimant has </span>knowledge
of the loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> and/or <span class="SpellE">nondelivery</span> of the goods before the expiration of the said
15-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">However, </span>when the consignee or claimant comes to learn of the
loss, damage, etc. <span style="">after the </span>15-day period from the discharge of the goods, <span style="">the period to file </span>a claim should
commence not from the said date of discharge but from such date when the
consignee or claimant is informed of the loss, damage, etc. of the merchandise,
or from <span style="">the date on which, with the
exercise </span>of reasonable diligence, such information could have been <span style="">se</span>cured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of determining whether the
consignee incurred in <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or unreasonable delay in
filing the claim, the fact to be considered <span style="">is: </span><span style="">when did the </span>consignee acquire knowledge of <span style="">the discharge of </span>the
goods from the <span style="">vessel, </span>or with <span style="">the exercise </span>of reasonable diligence, <span style="">such knowledge could </span>have been secured?</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the stipulation of facts show that <span style="">while </span>the goods were discharged from
the vessel on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="6"><span style="">June 26, </span>1961</st1:date>, there is no showing that the <span style="">consignee had </span>knowledge of the <span style="">discharge of the
merchandise on that date or soon thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the record shows is that on July 19, 1961, the </span><span style="">consignee requested </span>the agent of the
shipping com<span style="">pany to open the cargo vans
because the keys of the vans were still in the </span><span style="">p</span><span style="">osses</span><span style="">sion of the agent </span><span style="">of the carrier; and although the stipulation
of </span>facts further show that the goods were discharged <span style="">from the vessel on
June 28, 1961, and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contractor received
them and had kept them into its custody; however, there is no showing that before
July 19, 1961, the consignee had knowledge that the merchandise were already in
the possession </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contractor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was incumbent </span><span style="">upon the </span><span style="">defendants to show that the consignee had
knowledge of the discharge of the merchandise on or before July 19, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in the brief of the
appellants, We find no specific reference to any bit of evidence showing that
the consignee had knowledge of the discharge of the goods immediately or </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">short time after </span><st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="6"><span style="">June 28, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, therefore, </span><span style="">We </span><span style="">hold that the formal claim for the value of
the goods lost or damaged filed on July 31, 1961, was filed within the 15-day
provided in the management contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The next error assigned,
which relates to the </span><span style="">amount </span><span style="">for which
defendants-appellants should be held liable, needs no discussion as the
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, in its brief, concedes that only
the invoice value of the damaged goods, as stipulated, may be recovered from
the defendants-appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span><span style="">to
the award of attorney's fees in the amount of P500.00, which
defendants-appellants claim to be improper for the reason that it was not stipulated
by the parties, Article 2208 of the New Civil </span><span style="">Code </span><span style="">enumerates some exceptions to the rule prohibiting the award of
attorney's fees in the absence of stipulation, and one such exception is -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(11) In any other case when the court deems it just and
equitable that attorney's <span style="">fees </span>and
expenses of litigation should be recovered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">We are not in a position </span><span style="">to re-examine the
basis for the lower court's award of attorney's fees for this would involve a
review of the facts, inappropriate at this instance, and it would also be in
disregard of the tradition </span><span style="">that <span style="">discretion, when </span>w<span style="">ell exercised, should not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, in </span></span><span style="">cases </span><span style="">of similar nature</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the award of
attorney's fees was considered to be proper and reasonable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">PREMISES CONSIDERED</span></b><span style="">, with the only modification that the sum of
P4,305.55 is reduced to P3,989.70, <span style="">the
invoice value of the damaged goods, the judgment </span>holding <span style="">the defendants-appellants liable to
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On equitable considerations, no costs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
