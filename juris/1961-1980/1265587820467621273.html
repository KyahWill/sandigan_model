<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These are separate appeals 
instituted by <span class="SpellE">Antonino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al. (G.R. Nos. <span class="GramE">L-20300-01) and 
the Republic of the </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, et al. (G.R. 
Nos.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
L-20355-56), from a single decision of the Court of Appeals, as modified by its 
resolution of August 20, 1962, holding that Lots Nos. 49 and 1 of subdivision 
plan Psd-27941 are parts of the navigable portion of the territorial waters and 
outside the southern boundary of the Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
T-722, and declaring the occupants <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al. 
possessors in good faith, entitled to remain therein until reimbursed, by the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">intervenor</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Republic</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, of the necessary expenses made 
on the lots in the sums of P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and P25,000.00, 
respectively. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts of these cases, briefly 
stated, are as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> owned by Alfonso and <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> was originally 
covered by TCT No. T-722. In 1938, the Hacienda constructed a pier, called 
"Santiago Landing," about 600 meters long from the shore into the navigable 
waters of the <span class="SpellE">Pagaspas</span> Bay, to be used by vessels 
loading sugar produced by the Hacienda sugar mill. When the sugar mill ceased 
its operation in 1948, the owners of the Hacienda converted the pier into a 
fishpond dike and built additional strong dikes enclosing an area of about 30 
hectares (of the Bay) and converted the same into a fishpond. The Hacienda 
owners also enclosed a similar area of about 37 hectares of the Bay on the other 
side of the pier which was also converted into a fishpond. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In 1949, the <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> s ordered the subdivision of the Hacienda by ordering 
the preparation of the subdivision plan Psd-27941 wherein fishpond No. 1 (with 
30 hectares) was referred to as Lot No. 1 and fishpond No. 2 (with 37 hectares) 
referred to as Lot No. 49. The plan was approved by the Director of Lands, and 
the Register of Deeds issued, from TCT No. T-722, TCT. No. 2739 for Lots 49 and 
1 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In 1950, <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> sold to <span class="SpellE">Antonino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al., 
</span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lot</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 49 for which said purchasers 
obtained at first TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-2740 and later T-4718.</span> 
</span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lot</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 1, on the other hand, was 
purchased by Carlos <span class="SpellE">Goco</span>, et al., who, in turn, sold 
one half thereof to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sy-Juco</span>, et al. Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 4159 was issued in the names of the <span class="SpellE">Gocos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sy-Jucos</span>. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On May 24, 1952, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> filed with the Bureau of Fisheries an application 
for ordinary fishpond permit or lease for Lot 49, and an application for a 
similar permit, for Lot 1, was filed by his daughter <span class="SpellE">Clemencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>. The <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sy-Jucos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gocos</span> filed a protest with the au of Fisheries, claiming the 
properties to be private covered by certificates of title. This protest was 
dismissed by the Director of Fisheries, on the ground that the areas applied for 
are outside the boundaries of TCT No. of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>. This ruling was based the findings of the 
committee created by the Secretary Agriculture and Natural Resources to look 
into the matter, that Lots 1 and 49 are not originally included within the 
boundaries of the hacienda. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="10"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 
1, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the <span class="GramE">protestants</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sy—Tucos</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Gocos</span> filed an 
action in the Court of First Instance of Manila (<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. 
Case No. 24237) to restrain the Director of Fisheries from issuing the fishpond 
permits applied for by the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>. The court 
dismissed this petition, for non-exhaustion of administrative remedy, it 
appearing that petitioners had not appealed from the decision of the Director of 
Fisheries to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. On appeal to 
this Court, the decision of the lower court was sustained (G.R. No. L-8654, 
promulgated April 28, 1956). The <span class="GramE">protestants</span> then filed 
an appeal with the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. This time, 
the same was dismissed for being filed out of time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 16, 1956, the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> filed Civil Case 135 and the <span class="SpellE">Sy-Jucos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gocos</span>, Civil Case 
136, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, to 
quiet their titles over Lots 49 and 1. Named defendants were the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources and applicants <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>. The Republic of the Philippines was allowed to 
intervene in view of the finding by the investigating committee created by the 
respondent Secretary, that the lots were part of the foreshore area before their 
conversion into fishponds by the hacienda-owners. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 30, 1958, after due 
hearing, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> 
promulgated a joint decision making the finding, among others, that the 
subdivision plan Psd-27941 was prepared in disregard of the technical 
description stated in TCT No. T-722, because the survey or merely followed the 
existing shoreline and placed his monuments on the southwest lateral of Lot 49, 
which was the pier abutting into the sea; and made the conclusion that Lots 1 
and 49 of Psd-27941 were part of the fore shore lands. As the certificates of 
title obtained by petitioners covered lands not subject to registration, the 
same were declared null and void, and Lots 1 and 49 were declared properties of 
the public domain. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In its decision of October 51, 
1961, as well as the re solution of August 20, 1962, the appellate court adopted 
the findings of the lower court, that the lots in question are part of the 
foreshore area and affirmed the ruling canceling the titles issued to 
.plaintiffs. Although in the decision of October 31, 1961, the Court of Appeals 
awarded to applicants <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> damages in the amount 
of P200.00 per hectare from October 1, 1954, when plaintiffs were notified of 
the denial of their protest by the Director of Fisheries, such award was 
eliminated in the resolution of August 20, 1962, for the reason that plaintiffs, 
who relied on the efficacy of their certificates of title, cannot be considered 
possessors in bad faith until after the legality of their said titles has been 
finally determined. Appellants were thus declared entitled to retention of the 
properties until they are reimbursed by the landowner, the Republic of the 
Philippines, of the necessary expenses made on the lands, in the sums of 
P40,000.00 (for Lot 49) and P25.000.00 (for Lot 1). It is from this portion of 
the decision as thus modified that defendants <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> 
Republic of the Philippines appealed (in G. R. Nos. L-20355-56), claiming that 
plaintiffs’ possession became in bad faith when they learned of the flaw in 
their titles, that is, when their Protest against the applications for lease was 
denied by the Director of Fisheries. In addition, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> contends that being such possessors in bad faith, 
plaintiffs n not entitled to reimbursement of the expenses made on properties. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In G.R. 
Nos.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
L-20300-01, plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, et al. claim t the 
finding that the lots in question are part of the or foreshore area was 
erroneous, because from defendants’ own evidence, the same appear to be 
marshland their conversion into fishponds. It is noteworthy in connection with 
the appeal of plaintiffs that they do not contest the existence of the pier that 
was used by the hacienda owners in the loading of their manufactured sugar to 
vessels. The fact that said pier jotted out 600 meters to the sea indicates that 
the area over which such cemented structure spanned was part of the sea or at 
least foreshore land. And, plaintiffs were not able to disprove the testimonial 
evidence that the fishponds in question were constructed by enclosing the areas 
with dikes, using the pier as one of the ends of the fishponds. 'It is clear 
that the areas thus enclosed and converted into fishponds were really part of 
the foreshore. This, and the fact that the subdivision plan Psd-27941 was found 
to have been prepared not in accordance with the technical descriptions in TCT 
No. T—722 but in disregard of it, support the conclusion reached by both the 
lower court and the Court of Appeals that Lots 49 and 1 are actually part of the 
territorial waters and belong to the State. And, it is an elementary principle 
that the incontestable and indefeasible character of a Torrens certificate of 
title does not operate when the land thus covered is not capable of 
registration. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the matter of possession of 
plaintiffs-appellants, the ruling of the Court of Appeals must be upheld. There 
is no showing that plaintiffs are not purchasers in good faith and for value. As 
such title-holders, they have reason to rely on the indefeasible character of 
their certificates. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the issue of good faith of the 
plaintiffs, the Court of Appeals reasoned out: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The concept of possessor in good 
faith given in Art. 526 of the Civil Code and when said possession loses this 
character under Art. 528, needs to be reconciled with the doctrine of 
indefeasibility of a Torrens Title. Such reconciliation can only be achieved by 
holding that the possessor with a Torrens Title is not aware of any flaw in his 
title which invalidates it until his Torrens Title is declared null and void by 
final judgment of the Courts. "Even if the doctrine of indefeasibility of a 
Torrens Title not thus reconciled, the result would be the same, considering 
third paragraph of Art. 526 which provides that: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">ART. 526. * * * 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'Mistake upon a doubtful or 
difficult question of taw may be the basis of good faith.' 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The legal question whether 
plaintiffs-appellants' possession in good faith, under their Torrens Titles 
acquired in good faith, does not lose this character except in the case and from 
the moment their Titles art declared null and void by the Courts, is a difficult 
one. Even the members of this Court were for a long time divided, two to one, on 
the answer. It was only after several sessions, were the results of exhaustive 
researches on both sides were thoroughly discussed, that an undivided Court 
finally found the answer given in the next preceding paragraph. Hence, even if 
it be assumed for the sake of argument that the Supreme Court would find that 
the law is not as we have stated it in the next preceding paragraph and that the 
plaintiffs-appellants made a mistake in relying thereon, such mistake on a 
difficult question of taw may be the basis of good faith. Hence, their 
possession in good faith does not lose this character except in the case and 
from the moment their Torrens Titles are declared null and void by the 
Courts."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under the circumstances of the 
case, especially where the subdivision plan was originally approved by the 
Director of Lands, we are not ready, to conclude that the above reasoning of the 
Court of Appeals on this point is reversible error. Needless to state, as such 
occupants in good faith, plaintiffs have the right to the retention of the 
property until they are reimbursed of the necessary expenses made on the lands. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to the contention of 
the Republic of the Philippines that the order for the reimbursement by it of 
such necessary expenses constitutes a judgment against the government in a suit 
not consented by it, suffice it to say that the Republic, on its own initiative, 
asked and was permitted to intervene in the case and thereby submitted itself to 
the jurisdiction of the court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING 
CONSIDERATIONS</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
