<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1975</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1975</st1:date>,
the Acting Referee of Regional Office No. VII, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
rendered a decision granting the claim for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A pertinent portion of this decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Claimant <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bihag</span> joined the government service on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1964</st1:date> as classroom teacher at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lapu-lapu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Division of the Bureau of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was in good health until she complained of 'harsh and coarse throat
due to too much talking and explaining to her pupils' in the first grade in
1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1974</st1:date>, she was treated by Dr. Jorge <span class="SpellE">Dosdos</span> for 'gross <span class="SpellE">nasopharynx</span>
&amp; <span class="SpellE">hypapharynx</span> and metastasis, both sides of neck'
(physician's report).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1974</st1:date>, she suffered severe
throat pain while conducting classes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, she was treated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dosdos</span> at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Chong</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Hua</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her illness resulted in permanent total disability
and because of such disability, she was not able to return to her work until
she died on <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was survived by her husband, Patricio <span class="SpellE">Bihag</span>, and children, Charlie <span class="SpellE">Bihag</span>
and Richard <span class="SpellE">Bihag</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The herein claim for compensation was not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by the Superintendent of the Division of <span class="SpellE">Lapu-lapu</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this was the
favorable recommendation made by the committee he created to look into the
merits of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said committee
found that the illness of the claimant was contracted in the course of her
employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is here sufficient showing that the illness supervened
at the time of claimant's service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
gives rise to the presumption that said illness was caused or aggravated by her
employment in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her employment may not be the cause of the
illness, but the talking she always did to her pupils at school could cause
aggravation of the illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since no
evidence was presented to dispute this presumption, a conclusion favorable to
her claim for compensation is inescapable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, this Office finds this case within
the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, and that the claimant is entitled
to disability compensation equivalent to 60% of her weekly wage for 208 weeks,
pursuant to Section 15 of the said Act. 60% of P80.21 - her average weekly wage
- equals P48.12 and for 208 weeks, she is<b> </b>entitled to P6,000.00, the
maximum allowed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon claimant's death her right to compensation was deemed
transmitted to her legal heirs (RP vs. WCC, et al., L-29703, Feb. 25, 1971).
Shown to be the legal heirs of the claimant are her husband, Patricio <span class="SpellE">Bihag</span>, and her two children mentioned earlier and to them
the compensation due the claimant passes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1975</st1:date>,
respondent employer filed a motion for reconsideration of this order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by the acting referee on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1975</st1:date>, and the entire
records were forwarded to the Workmen's Compensation Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 26, 1975, respondent Workmen's Compensation
Commission rendered a decision reversing that of the acting referee and denying
the claim for compensation, on the ground that "the cause of death of
decedent is carcinoma <span class="SpellE">nasopharynx</span> and as such, it has
no causal relationship with the nature of her employment."</p>

<p class="BODY">This finding is predicated on the medical report of Angelina V.
Cruz <span class="SpellE">Geoneratne</span>, Medical Supervisor I, which states
that "Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bihag</span>
was treated for CA of the <span class="SpellE">nasopharynx</span> and died on <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Cancer is a disease of unknown etiology

de Castillo (G.R. No. L-29998, Oct. 21, 1974, 60, SCRA, 228) would support the
medical report that cancer is not an occupational disease, but at the same time
stressed that it is not an obstacle to the compensability of any illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records would show that the principal
duties of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bihag</span>
as a classroom teacher was mostly talking and explaining to her Grade I
pupils.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She entered the government
service on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1964</st1:date> in
good health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1972</st1:date>, she complained of hoarse
throat due to too much talking and explain­ing to her pupils and was treated by
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dosdos</span> for (1) mass carcinoma <span class="SpellE">nasopharynx</span>
and (2) metastasis, both sides of the neck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1974</st1:date>,
she became sick of sinusitis affecting eyesight and throat, with severe
headache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1974</st1:date>, or about 3 months
afterwards, she did of carcinoma of the <span class="SpellE">nasopharynx</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indubitably, the principal duties and responsibilities of the
deceased as a classroom teacher directly affected her vocal cavity and may have
exhausted the chord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Continuous talking
can be a contributory factor to her disease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Medical science accepts certain contributory factors in the etiology of
carcinoma of the esophagus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
contributory theories offered are irritation of the <span class="SpellE">esophogical</span>
mucosa by chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli (p. 169, Vol. I
Gastroenterology by Backus, Second Ed.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plainly, it was during and in the course of the deceased's employment as
a classroom teacher that she felt the symptoms of her ailment and it was also
during her employment when she suffered cancer of the esophagus which is the
principal cause of her death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
very least, therefore, the nature and condition of her work contributed to and
aggravated in a large measure her ailment and entitled her to compensation
under the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Lilia D. Simon versus Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(G.R. No. L-42510, <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1976</st1:date>),
citing a very recent case penned by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
G., Martin, held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> assuming the employee's illness may be ruled out an
occupational disease or that the causal link between the nature of his
employment and his ailment, has been insufficiently shown, nevertheless, it is
to be presumed as mandated by Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act that
the employee's illness which supervened during his employment either arose out
of, or at least aggravated by said employment and with this presumption, the
burden of proof shifts to the employer and the employee is relieved of the
burden to show causation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
before us, the respondent has failed to discharge that burden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere opinion of the doctor who treated
the petitioner that '<span class="SpellE">dermoid</span> cyst' is congenital,
although he admitted that it may also be aggravated by her employment, cannot
prevail over the presumption of compensability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
It is now well settled that once it is established that the illness supervened
during employment, as in this case, there is a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span>
presumption that such illness arose out of the employment or was aggravated by
it; and the employer has the burden of proving the contrary by substantial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here the petitioner failed to
discharge that burden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not adduce
substantial evidence tending to show that the disease which caused the death of
the late Alfonso Castillo was not service-connected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere opinion of its plant physician that
there was no causal connection between cancer of the liver and the nature of Castillo's
employment cannot prevail over the said presumption.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the subsequent case of <span class="SpellE">Laron</span> vs.
Workmen's Compensation Commission and Republic of the Philip­pines (Department
of Health) [L-43344, Sept. 29, 1976], the deceased, who was a cook in a
government hospital, died of stomach cancer and was granted death benefits by
reason of his death, because the ailment supervened during his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as found by the referee, there was no timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> on the part of the superintendent, as
representative of the Bureau of Public Schools, which failure constitutes a
waiver of all defenses other than jurisdictional.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, THE DECISION OF THE RESPONDENT WORKMEN'S
