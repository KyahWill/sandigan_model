				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The scope of the power of the Commission on Elections to appoint
members of the municipal board of canvassers to replace those councilors who
are candidates is to be inquired into in this certiorari proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The municipal council shall constitute
the municipal board of canvassers, excluding the members who are candidates and
who shall be replaced by the Com­mission on Elections with registered voters of
the same party."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Ibuna</span>, as chairman of the local <span class="SpellE">Naciona­lista</span>
Party of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, impugned the appointment of
one Cesar <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>, a Liberal, to the municipal
board of canvassers of <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city> to
replace <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>, who
was elected in 1963, his certificate of candidacy then showing that he was a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> running as an independent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a candidate anew in 1967, his
certificate of candidacy categorically stating "that he belongs" to
the "<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party".<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The appointment by respondent Com­mission on Elections of one Arturo Casanova,
also a Liberal, to such board of canvassers in place of Arturo de Guzman, was
like­wise challenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De Guzman was
elected councilor in <span class="GramE">1963,</span> his certificate of
candidacy was to the effect that he was then a <span class="SpellE">Naciona­lista</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His certificate of candidacy when he ran for reelection
in 1967 was not made a part of the petition presumably because he had by that
time affiliated with the Liberal Party, according to the answer of the
respondent Commission on Elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the stand of respondent that such a change of party affiliation
rendered valid the aforesaid choice of a Liberal in place of Councilor de
Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for Councilor <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>, respondent Commission on Elections defended its
action on the allegation that the person named by it was the one recommended by
him, there being on his part an express objection to the nominee of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ibuna</span>. "The party representation, as a matter of
Commission's policy, must be preserved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But in the absence of any party, then the candidate himself shall have
the choice to recommend his <span class="GramE">replacement</span>." For as
the Commission stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When Mr. <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span> was elected in 1963, but proclaimed in <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1967</st1:date> and assumed office
thereafter, he was still [an] independent candidate."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. As to the case of the replacement of Councilor <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>, it being clear from his certificates of candidacy
that both in 1963 and in 1967, he was a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>,
the appointment of a person who is not a registered voter of such party finds
no support in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true
that his certificate of candidacy indicated the absence of any party as was the
thinking of respondent Commission, then perhaps the discretionary power vested
in the Commission could have afforded a colorable justification for the choice
of the person named to replace him, who admittedly was not a member of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such is not the case however, and the statutory provision is
quite explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress having
pronounced its will, it is the duty of the Commission to obey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase the opinion of the then,
Justice now Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Abcede</span> v. Imperial,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the question of policy is for Congress not the Commission to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is in disagreement with what the law
requires, the remedy is to call the attention of the legislative body with such
suggestion or proposal for change as it may deem best.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While recognizing then that it acted in good
faith, it appears undeniable that in thus choosing a person not a registered
voter of the same party, respondent Commission acted "beyond the bounds of
its jurisdiction."</p>

<p class="BODY">In another decision through the then Chief Justice Moran, this
Court stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The functions and
powers of the Commission on Elections are limited by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no legislative power to change or
modify the law, nor may such power be delegated to the Com­mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the action taken by the
Commission on Elections finds no support in law."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">A word more.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission in its choice of
replace­ment is not restricted to the person or persons recommended by
petitioner as chairman of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Juan</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that
the law requires is that its appointee is a registered voter of such party.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with the
replacement of Councilor de Guzman who was elected in 1963 as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> but who thereafter became a Liberal, there is
no unanimity of opinion among the members of the Court concerning the validity
of the action taken by the Com­mission.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the majority view however that what the Commission did was
in accordance with the literal language of the law, which speaks of excluding
from the municipal board of canvassers "the members who are candidates and
who shall be replaced by the Commission on Elections with registered voters of
the same party." As of the time of the disqualification of Councilor De Guzman,
he was a member of the Liberal Party; his replacement should therefore be a
regis­tered voter of such party.</p>

<p class="BODY">As was declared by this Court in a 1913 decision, its first and
fundamental duty is to apply the law. "Construction and interpretation
come only after it has been demonstrated that application is impossible or
inadequate without them."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, if the choice were made to fall on a person belonging to a different
party, then it might upset the balance of power unnecessarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an approach likewise is indicated by <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> v. Tan,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court implied that changes of a per­manent character as to
membership in political parties in the House of Representatives would not be
denied recognition in the composition of the Commission on Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">A minority of this Court, Justices <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>,
Sanchez, and the writer of this opinion, is of the belief, however, that the
language of the law is not sufficiently plain and explicit to call for only one
interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, there are gaps to be filled and ambiguities to be
cleared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the thinking of this
group that if the time that determines the party status of the replacement is
the date of the disqualification and not the date of the election, then added
encouragement would be given elective officials who for reasons of their own
are not averse to changing parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, an interpretation that would affix the stamp of
approval on councilors becoming turncoats would hinder rather than promote
party solidarity and strength as seemed to be envisioned both in the
Constitution and the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the right to the replacement should be looked upon as
appertaining not to the candidate but to the party, <span class="GramE">without
whose help in the first place he could not have been elected</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question however but that the language of Section 167
could be rendered much more explicit so that it may be crystal clear and free
from doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be admitted also
that in the light of previous decisions, such task has been thought of as
properly apper­taining to the legislative branch of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appointment of Arturo Casanova to replace
Arturo de Guzman in the municipal board of canvassers of <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Juan</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> is sustained,
and the appointment of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span> to such board
to replace Councilor <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>
nullified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order is
lifted to enable respondent Commission on Elections to act in accordance with
the opinion of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
replacement of Councilor <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span> having been chosen,
the board of canvassers of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> as
reconstituted shall proceed according to law.<span style="">&nbsp;
