<p class=BODY>From the evidence of the petitioner, it appears that on various
dates before the lapse of the stipulated ten (10) year period within which she
may repurchase the land, specifically on April 2, 10 and 11, 1965, she offered
and actually tendered the agreed repurchase price of P10,436.75 to the private
respondents at their house in Los <span class=SpellE>Baños</span>, Laguna.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The offer and tender of payment was turned
down on the alleged ground that the two children of the private respondents,
Eduardo and Tony, were not agreeable to the said sum, as they demanded P50<span
class=GramE>,000.00</span>, later reduced to P45,000.00 as the repurchase
price.</p>

<p class=BODY>Due to the persistent refusal by the private respondents to
accept the tendered amount of P10<span class=GramE>,436.75</span>, petitioner's
lawyer sent them a letter on April 13, 1965 informing them that his client,
Ruby H. Gardner, will deposit for consignation the amount of P10,436.75 with
the Court of First Instance of Laguna, <span class=SpellE>Biñan</span> Branch,
on April 19, 1965 at 8:00 o'clock in the morning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since the private respondents failed to
accept the said amount before <st1:date Year="1965" Day="19" Month="4">April
 19, 1965</st1:date>, petitioner consequently deposited the sum of P10<span
class=GramE>,436.75</span> for consignation with the above court on the said
date, and by another letter to the private respondents, informed them of the
consignation.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the other hand, the private respondents alleged that they
refused to accept the amount of P10,436.75 as repurchase price of the property
be­cause the said amount was grossly inadequate to compensate for the
improvements introduced by them on the said land; that the value of the
improvements alone aggregates to not less than P30,000.00, specifically:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>100 <span class=SpellE>rambutan</span> trees,
300 <span class=SpellE>lanzones</span> trees, 40 <span class=SpellE>indian</span>
mango trees, 30 Bangkok <span class=SpellE>santol</span> trees, 40 <span
class=SpellE>marcotted</span> <span class=SpellE>chico</span> trees, 2,000
coffee seedlings, 2,000 cacao seedlings, a residential house worth P10,000.00,
and the clearings of the undergrowth of cogon and grass on the property; that
these improvements were introduced by the respondents spouses on the faith of a
stipulation in the Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase executed by the
petitioner giving them the preferential right to buy the land in dispute at the
rate of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) per hectare; that this
stipulation was breached by the petitioner because on April 7, 1965, the land
was sold to one <span class=SpellE>Bienvenido</span> <span class=SpellE>Banaag</span>
for P232,551.00 and the remaining portion thereof measu­ring about 7,130 square
meters was sold to one Sally Lopez for P5,000.00 plus other considerations.</p>

<p class=BODY>On her alleged breach of contract, petitions countered that she
had offered her land for sale the private respondents since 1961; that, in
fact, prior to April 19, 1965 she again offered to sell to the private respondents
and informed them that if they were not in a position to buy the land, she was
selling the same to others, and allegedly, the private respondents had no
objections to such sale and even offered to locate a buyer for her; that,
therefore, there was no breach of contract.</p>

<p class=BODY>With respect to private respondents' claim for value of the
improvements introduced by them on the land, petitioner contended that at the
time of the execution of the contracts (Exhibits A and B), there were on the
land, visible or growing fruit-bearing trees, specifically:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>100,000 banana plants, 17 <span class=SpellE>chico</span>
trees, 100 <span class=SpellE>calamansi</span> trees, 100 orange trees, 9 <span
class=SpellE>casoy</span> trees, 2 <span class=SpellE>siniguelas</span> trees,
25 <span class=SpellE>lucban</span> trees, 9 avocado trees, 3 <span
class=SpellE>guyabano</span> trees, 5 <span class=SpellE>nangka</span> trees,
and half of the whole land area was planted to rice and corn; that, when she
repossessed the land, she found that most of what she planted was either
destroyed or dead; that the residential house constructed on the land by the
private respondents was actually used for sometime as a cabaret; that,
therefore, whatever improvements made by the private respondents could not even
compensate for the damage done to her property while in their possession.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the basis of the above evidence, the lower court declared that
the Contract of Sale with Right of Repurchase is really a contract of equitable
mortgage; denied the claim of spouses <span class=SpellE>Eugenio</span> de
Castro and Trinidad Mar for the value of the improvements introduced by them;
and rendered judgment for plaintiff Ruby H. Gardner declaring the consignation
properly made with the effect of releasing her from her obligation to the
defendant spouses under the contracts, Exhibits A and B.</p>

<p class=BODY>On appeal filed by the defendants, the appellate court, on
September 6, 1969, rendered its decision which, while affirming the lower
court's decision declaring the consignation validly made, went further and
declared the plaintiff-<span class=SpellE>appellee</span>, Ruby H. Gardner,
guilty of breach of contract upon its finding that Gardner sold the land to
third persons at a much higher price instead of selling the land to the spouses
De Castro for the stipulated price of P1<span class=GramE>,500.00</span> per
hectare.</p>

<p class=BODY>Not entirely satisfied with the above decision, Ruby H. Gardner
filed this present appeal by <i>certiorari</i> seeking the affirmation of the
judgment declaring the consignation validly made, and the setting aside of the
award of damages consisting of reimbursement for actual losses and unrealized
profits to the spouses De Castro.</p>

<p class=BODY>Anent the issue of the validity of the con­signation, <span
class=GramE>We</span> affirm and uphold that part of the appealed decision
declaring the consignation to be validly made.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The law and related jurisprudence are clear that in order that
consignation may be effec­tive, the debtor must first comply with certain
requirements prescribed by law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
debtor must show (1) that there was a debt due; (2) that the consignation of
the obligation had been made because the creditor to whom tender of payment was
made refused without reason to accept it or refuses to give receipt thereof, or
because several persons claimed to be entitled to receive the amount due, or
because the title of the obligation has been lost (Art. 1256, New Civil Code);
(3) that previous notice of the consignation had been given to the person
interested in the performance of the obligation (Art. 1257, New Civil Code);
(4) that the amount due was placed at the disposal of the court (Art. 1258, New
Civil Code); and (5) that after the consignation had been made the person
interested was notified thereof (Art. 1258, New Civil Code).<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>From the undisputed facts of the case, it is admitted that a debt
was owing from the petitioner to the private respondents; there was tender of
payment of the agreed stipulated repurchase price of P10,436.75; the tender was
refused without reason, i.e., the contention that the agreed repurchase price
was grossly inadequate to cover the alleged improvements introduced by the
private respondents is not an adequate reason for refusal because the terms of
the contracts (Exhibits A and B) are clear that petitioner can repurchase the
pro­perty by merely paying back to the private respondents the amount of
P10,436.75 within a period of ten (10) years from the date of execution of the
contracts, without any stipulation as to any improve­ments that may be
introduced by the respondents-spouses on the land; there was also previous
notice to the respondents-spouses of the desire of petitio­ner to deposit the
said amount in court, which in fact was deposited on April 19, 1965 with the
Court of First Instance of Laguna, <span class=SpellE>Biñan</span> Branch; and lastly,
notice of the fact of consignation was given to the private respondents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These facts prove that a valid consignation
was made with the resultant effect of releasing petitioner Ruby H. Gardner from
her indebtedness to the respondents-spouses <span class=SpellE>Eugenio</span>
de Castro and <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> Mar.</p>

<p class=BODY>The second issue before <span class=GramE>Us</span> is whether or
not the Court of Appeals can properly make a finding of breach of contract in a
purely consignation case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under the
circumstances of the case at bar, the answer must be in the affirmative.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although this is a case where the only
question properly before the lower court and likewise, the appellate court, is
the validity of the consignation and its <span class=SpellE>effectivity</span>
to extinguish the obligation of the plaintiff, We find that during the trial the
parties had presented evidence, testimonial and documentary, on their
respective contentions with respect to the alleged breach of contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, by their consent and acquiescence, they
had broadened the issues to include petitioner's alleged breach of contract
which in fact was litigated by them before the trial court, and hence throwing
the entire case open for the appellate court's review.</p>

<p class=BODY>The last issue raised by the petitioner which We deem decisive is
the correctness of that part of the appealed decision declaring that Ruby H.
Gardner committed breach of contract and ordering her to pay the private
respondents, damages consisting of P30<span class=GramE>,000.00</span> as
actual losses and P100,000.00 as unrealized profits, by reason of the alleged
breach.</p>

<p class=BODY>To this part of the appealed decision, <span class=GramE>We</span>
do not agree.</p>

<p class=BODY>The pertinent stipulation alleged to have been violated states:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;(2) That in case the land and its improvements will be sold,
the vendee spouses (<span class=SpellE>Eugenio</span> de Castro and Trinidad
Mar) shall be given the first opportunity to buy the land under the condition
that the price for the same will be at the rate of ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
(P1,500.00) pesos per hectare;&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>We have examined the records carefully and We find the positive
testimony of petitioner Ruby H. Gardner that she had offered her land for sale
to the respondents-spouses in 1961 (<span class=SpellE>t.s.n</span>., pp.
14-15, Hearing of October 27, 1965 cited in CA Decision, 55, Records), and this
is not denied by the latter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The records
also clearly disclose the oral evidence given by petitioner that prior to April
19, 1965, she told the respondents that if they would not be in a position to
buy the land, she was selling it to another person; that in answer, the De <span
class=SpellE>Castros</span> told her that she could proceed in selling the
property to another person; that in fact they told her that they are willing to
help her locate a buyer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(<span
class=SpellE>t.s.n</span>., Hearing of <st1:date Year="1965" Day="27" Month="10">October
 27, 1965</st1:date>, pp. 23-24 cited in Motion for Reconsideration, Records,
p. 69).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This also was not denied or
contradicted by respondents.</p>

<p class=BODY>The clear and convincing evidence shown above constrains <span
class=GramE>Us</span> to find that petitioner had substan­tially complied with
the stipulation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We hold that said
stipulation must be strictly construed to mean that if the best price
obtainable by the petitioner was at P1<span class=GramE>,500.00</span> per
hectare, then the respondents must be given the first opportunity to buy the
land, otherwise if the price offered by any prospective buyer was more than or
above P1,500.00 per hectare, the petitioner was not under obligation to sell
the land to the respondents-spouses.</p>

<p class=BODY>As was actually the case at bar, petitioner was able to find two
buyers who bought the land, namely, <span class=SpellE>Bienvenido</span> <span
class=SpellE>Banaag</span> and Sally Lopez at a price considerably much higher
than P1,500.00 per hectare.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be
contrary to common sense and ordinary prudence to construe that under the
stipulation in question, the parties intended that the price of the land be
pegged or tied to a specified price per hectare when it is of general knowledge
that the value of real property tends always to rise especially in the
particular area of the land in ques­tion, which is at Los <span class=SpellE>Baños</span>,
Laguna, a highly agricultural region and a most valued health resort community.</p>

<p class=BODY>Be that as it may, the deed of sale with <span class=SpellE><u>pacto</u></span><u>
de retro</u> having been declared by the trial court and the appellate court as
an equitable mortgage, to which We agree, it follows as a legal consequence
that the land was constituted as a mortgage or security for the loan obtained
by the petitioner from the respondents in the total amount of P10<span
class=GramE>,436.75</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other
words the consideration for such mortgage was the loan secured from the
mortgagees, the respondents herein.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
mortgage being merely an accessory to the principal obligation of the obligor, <span
class=GramE>We</span> find no other consideration for the stipulation inserted
in the instrument denominated &quot;Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase&quot;
and, therefore, the stipulation is null and void.</p>

<p class=BODY>Since We find no breach of contract committed by the petitioner,
the award of damages granted by the, respondent court consisting of alleged
losses to the respondents-spouses in the amount of P30,000.00 and unrealized
profits in the sum of P100,000.00 has no legal or factual basis and is,
therefore, a reversible error.</p>

<p class=BODY>As a general rule, the mortgagee who is in possession of the
mortgaged property and introduces improvements therein is not entitled to
reimbursement for the value thereof upon the redemption of the mortgage for
according to Art. <span class=GramE>2125, par. 2, N.C.C., &quot;the persons in
whose favor the law establishes a mortgage have no other right than to demand
execution and the recording of the document in which the mortgage is
formalized.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=BODY>In the case at bar, respondents-spouses have no right to claim
for reimbursement of the value of the improvements introduced by them on the
land, for the possession of the mortgagee is subject to the right of redemption
by the mortgagor who at any time may exercise such right within the period
stipulated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the mortgagee improves
the land, he does so at his risk.</p>

<p class=BODY>To hold otherwise would render redemption oppressive and onerous
to the owner-<span class=SpellE>redemptioner</span>, if not nugatory and
inoperative, for all that a scheming mortgagee interested in owning the land
would do is to saddle the land with so much improvements that the owner will
find <span class=GramE>himself</span> financially incapable of redeeming the
mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The value of the improvements
will have to be added to the prin­cipal indebtedness thereby driving the debtor
deeper and deeper into debt until he is finally &quot;improved out&quot; of his
property.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is affirmed insofar
as it declares the validity of the consignation thereby releasing the
petitioner from her obligation to the private respondents; the award of damages
for losses and unrealized profits is set aside with costs against the private
respondents.</p>
