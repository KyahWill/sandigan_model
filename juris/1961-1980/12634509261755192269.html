				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the accused from a judgment of conviction in
two cases jointly tried by the Court of <span style="">First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said cases arose from an incident which took place on <st1:date month="11" day="29" year="1952">November 29, 1952</st1:date>, in front of the
house of the de­ceased, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Gomez, a barrio
lieutenant, by a small street in barrio <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Niño</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, at <span style="">around
four to </span><st1:time hour="16" minute="30"><span style="">four thirty</span></st1:time><span style="">
in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started with an
altercation between <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>
and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, and ended with <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> Castro, <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>’ companion,
shooting two persons who later got involved, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Gomez, who was killed, and <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, who was wounded but did not die.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> we thereafter
filed against <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> Castro in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> for murder of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Gomez (Criminal Case No. 1546) and for frustrated murder
of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> (Criminal
Case No. 1597).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated, the cases
were jointly tried, after <span style="">the accused entered a plea of not gu</span><span style="">ilty to both charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
trial, the accused was </span><span style="">convicted of the murder of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Gomez, for which the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> </span><span style="">was imposed, plus indemnity of P6,000.00 to
the heirs and P1,400.00 to the widow of the deceased; and for attempted murder
of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>, to suffer
four (4) months and </span><span style="">twenty (20) days of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor, as minimum
to four (4) </span><span style="">years and two (2)
months of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>,
as maximum, plus indemnity of P800.00 with subsidiary imprisonment if
insolvent, and costs, credit of one-half of preventive imprisonment, if any,
and forfeiture </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the revolver used in the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And hence this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that at the time of the incident there were a
number of persons inside the house of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Gomez where a game of <span class="SpellE">monte</span> was in pro­gress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution tried to establish through
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>
that he and his brother <span class="SpellE">Can­dido</span> went to the house to
look for some companions who <span style="">were
gambling there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After staying for about
twenty minutes he went out and met Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, a
policeman then in plainclothes and off duty, who commented that it would be proper
to put a hand grenade into the car owned by <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of Feb. </span>24, <span style="">1955, <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said </span>car was then parked in the street
in front of the deceased's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
had exchanged words when <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> Castro, <span class="SpellE">Brio­nes</span>' companion, also a policeman then off duty and in
plainclothes, came out of the house and asked <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>
if <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> was tough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> did not
answer, Castro challenged <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> to fight but the
latter refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Gomez arrived and tried to pacify Castro, explain­ing that <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span>
will not fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Castro refused to
listen, Gomez warned that "Before you harm him, you better harm me
first." At this, Castro brushed Gomez aside saying "You are
another." Gomez then raised his hands and said "We will not fight
you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Castro stepped <span style="">back, and calling him "son of a
harlot" pulled out his gun and fired at Gomez, who </span>was <span style="">hit in the head and fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of Dec. 23,
1955, <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>, pp. </span><span style="">2-6)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As Gomez was shot, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> came out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro also shot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hit by the first shot, he fell to the ground
and tried to protect himself by kicking Castro as the latter continued to
shoot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this instance, <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> got a piece of stone and hit Castro on the
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro then faced <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> and tried to shoot him but he grabbed Castro's
arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They both fell on the ground as
they grappled for the gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow
Castro was able to stand up, but before he could shoot, <span class="SpellE">Donacia­no</span>
threw the stone at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro ran with <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> chasing him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> was not able to catch him
because he was able to board a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> (Tsn., ibid.,
pp. 6-7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span>
then brought his brother to the hos­pital.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>
testified that, having been told that his brother was arguing with somebody, he
went out of the house to find out what was going <span style="">on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
was then that he <span style="">was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fallen to the</span><span style=""> ground, he kicked Castro <span class="SpellE">every<span style="">time</span></span></span> the latter fired at
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro suddenly stopped firing at
him and he saw <span class="SpellE">Donaciano</span> grapple with Castro after
which Castro was able to run away (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of March <span style="">16, </span>1956, <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>,
pp. 24-27, 32).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Vitugs</span>’ foregoing testimony was
corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Menen</span> Gomez who stated that he saw
the incident happen as he was seated on one of the two jeeps parked in front of
the house of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Conrada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>-Gomez,
the deceased's wife, did not see the deceased being shot (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>.,
ibid., p. 37), but she testified to Castro's occasional presence in their house
where her husband maintained <span style="">a </span>gambling
den.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that afternoon, she testified to
having seen <span class="SpellE">Menen</span> Gomez sitting with her son in the
jeep (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., ibid., p.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>51).</p>

<p class="BODY">Setting forth the theory of self-defense, <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
Cas­tro and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> stated that they went to
the house of the deceased merely to check a report that said de­ceased was
again maintaining a gambling den.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
the exchange of words between them, the deceased Gomez pushed Castro, after
which he felt himself hit on the head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As Castro fell on his knees, dizzy, he pulled out his gun and, noticing
that two men were coming at him, shot them <span style="">in the belief that he was about to be killed (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>
of May 6<span style="">,</span> 1958, pp. 72-81; <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of May 14, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>,
pp. </span><span style="">64-65).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Jorge
<span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>, a <span class="SpellE">puto</span> vendor,
claimed that he saw a man hit Castro with a big stone while the latter was
talking to the deceased Gomez (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of July 28, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>, pp. 88-90).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Gomez
and <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> were shot
by <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> Castro.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely how this hap­pened <span style="">depends
</span>upon which of the conflicting testimonies of the parties are
credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
gave cre<span style="">dence to the testimony of the
witnesses of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule
adhered to by Us in </span><span style="">such cases
is that “</span><span style="">as far as credibility
and veracity of witnesses are concerned, the conclusions of the lower court
command great weight and respect, on the ground that the trustworthiness of
witnesses and the merit of the defenses by the accused, are in the peculiar
domain of the trial court."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In this case We see no reason for departing
from the same rule, there being no showing that some fact or circumstance of
great importance to the </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">has been overlooked in the records or
misapplied or its significance misunder­stood by the lower court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, for instance, objects to the lower court's finding
that he and <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> proceeded to the deceased's house
with "noise and fanfare" on the ground that this is not found in the
records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point, however, is that
this circumstance <span style="">is </span>of no moment, as far as the finding of guilt is concerned.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records, on the other hand, show that even a defense witness,
<span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talao</span>, testified
that he saw Cas­tro shoot Gomez as the latter was trying to pacify the former (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of April <span style="">6, </span><span style="">1957,
p. </span>55).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Affidavits were presented in the attempt to dismiss the
case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that of <span class="SpellE">Conrada</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pili</span>-Gomez, wherein she stated that she was no longer
interested in the criminal action because she was convinced that Gomez's death
was acci<span style="">dental or unavoidable; those of
<span class="SpellE">Menen</span> Gomez and of <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talao</span> wherein both stated that they now realize that having
been hit first, Castro merely shot in self-defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is Our opinion that the lower court rightly dis­regarded these
affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Conrada</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pili</span>-Gomez con­firmed her affidavit under oath, she
admitted having agreed to Castro's proposal of settlement in considera­tion of
P500.00 (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of Nov. 11, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>,
pp. <span style="">57- </span>58).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">Menen</span> Gomez and
<span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Talao</span> admitted in
open court that they signed the affidavits upon the request of <span class="SpellE">Conrada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>-Gomez who explained
that the case was be­ing amicably settled (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of
Nov. 11, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, pp. 51-61).</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to stress, the present criminal cases are not subject to
compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the opinion of <span class="SpellE">Conrada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>-Gomez as to the
guilt of the accused, is not con­trolling, since she was not a witness to the
incident in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence, We find testimony to the effect that when
shot, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> had his hands up, either to show that he
would not fight, in fright, or to try to ward off the shots that were to come (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of Feb. 24, 1955, <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, p.
<span style="">6; </span><span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>
of Dec. 23, <span style="">1955, </span>p. <span style="">6; </span><span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of April
<span style="">6, </span><span style="">1957, </span><span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>,
p. 55).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the deceased was in a
defenseless position when Castro shot him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This constituted treachery and qualified the offense to mur­der which is
punishable under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code by reclusion temporal in
its maximum period to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
accused voluntarily surrendered (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of May <span style="">4, </span>1957, <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>,
p. 70; <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of May 6, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>,
p. 81), there obtains a mitigating circums­tance in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the penalty should be imposed in
its minimum period, reclusion temporal maxi­mum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the indeterminate sentence law should be
ap­plied, ranging in its minimum from <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor
maximum to reclusion temporal medium (a degree lower to reclusion temporal
maximum to death).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As to the other charge,
frustrated murder, one phy<span style="">sician </span>Dr.
<span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, senior
resident physician of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Provincial Hospital,
testified that without medical attendance, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> would have died (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> of <span style="">Jan. 9, </span><span style="">1955, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Vergara</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">pp. </span><span style="">22-23), while
another doctor, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Guerrero, who treated <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> in the UST
hospital, believed that the wounds of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> were
not necessarily fatal </span>so <span style="">that he
may or may not have recovered without medical treatment (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>
of Feb. 18, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span> pp. 13-14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We consider this doubt in favor of the
accused and affirm the trial court’s conviction for attempted murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, accused surrendered
voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying this mitigating circumstance
</span><span style="">also </span><span style="">to the penalty for attempted murder (<span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccio­<span style="">nal</span></span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">maximum to <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
mayor medium), the indeterminate sentence minimum should be anywhere from <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor maximum to <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
correctional medium; and the indeterminate </span><span style="">maximum </span><span style="">should be <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>
maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the penalty should
be an <u>indeterminate sen­tenced minimum</u> of four (4) months and twenty
(20) days of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor (as fixed by </span>the <span style="">court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>) up to an <u>in­determinate
sentence maximum</u> of four (4) years two (2) months <u>and (1) day</u> of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> (add one day
to bring it within the minimum period of the penalty </span>provided for by
law).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is hereby modified,
affirming conviction in both cases, but reducing the pe­nalty for murder to an
indeterminate sentence of from ten (10) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor as <span style="">minimum to </span>seventeen (17) years, four (4)
months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum, plus the indemnity
provided for in the said judgment, and costs, with credit <span style="">for </span>preventive
imprisonment, if any; and correcting the penalty for the attempted murder to
four (4) months and twenty (20) days of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span>
mayor, as minimum, to <span style="">four </span><span style="">(4) </span>years, two
(2) months <u>and one(1) day</u> of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>; in all other respects, said judgment is
