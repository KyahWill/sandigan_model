HON. PEDRO C. QUITAIN, DISTRICT JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MASBATE, BRANCH II, MASBATE, MASBATE, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It was the issuance of a warrant of arrest against complainant
Dr. Gil <span class="SpellE">Geñorga</span>, the former municipal health officer
of <span class="SpellE">Claveria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
thereafter assigned to <span class="SpellE">Tayasan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental, for his failure to appear as government medico-legal witness in a pending
murder case before respondent Judge Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Quitain</span>
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, that
started the train of events leading to this administrative complaint for grave
abuse of authority and conduct unbecoming a judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The excuse offered for such nonappearance was
the fact that he had previously sent a telegram to respondent Judge seeking
information as to whether he would be reimbursed for the traveling expenses to
be incurred and that he had received no reply.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result thereof, he "terribly suffered from the humiliation of
having been arrested and confined in the headquarters of the Philippine
Constabulary as if [he] were a criminal, from May 9, 1975 to May 14, 1975 when,
upon [his] repeated pleas that [he]<span style=""> </span>was
not going to escape, the Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental, allowed [him] to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> alone
at [his] own expense."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
That he did, and he was able <span style="">to </span>testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge then dictated in open court
the order for his release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
in the chambers of the latter, when he sought to explain why he failed to
appear, he complained that he was ignored and treated with discourtesy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the <span class="GramE">basis for his
charge</span> of conduct unbecoming a district judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge was required to comment on such complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He submitted an eight-page explanation, the
relevant portion of which follows: "Clearly, this charge stemmed from the
order of arrest issued by the undersigned against the complainant for his
failure to appear in Court on March 5, 1975, in spite of <span style="">a </span>subpoena duly served upon him as a
government witness in the case hereinabove mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, the complainant addressed a telegram to
the undersigned, in exact words, to wit: '[Advice undersigned <span class="SpellE">agrave</span> (<u>sic</u>) party <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>
shoulder traveling expenses per diem appear government witness <span class="SpellE">Azanares</span> case March 5 . . . Dr. <span class="SpellE">Geñorga</span>].'
True, the undersigned did not make any reply because it was the honest
conviction of the undersigned that he is not duty bound to make any inquiry for
the complainant, much less advice the complainant in any manner, not to mention
the fact that the telegram carried the tone of an order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lacked the element of courtesy since the
telegram did not sound as a request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is also true that the complainant did not appear in Court on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1975</st1:date> that he might testify as
the last witness for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1975</st1:date>,
the undersigned, on motion of the Fiscal, ordered the complainant arrested * *
*.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that the
complainant received the subpoena issued by the undersigned requiring him to
appear on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1975</st1:date> so
he could not testify for the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is borne out by the records of the case."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Further: "In passing, may it be said that as a national employee, the
complainant knows that he is entitled to traveling expenses, per diems and
official time, every time he complies with a subpoena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be the reason why he secured from
the Clerk of Court a Certificate of Appearance which was accordingly issued to
him. * * * May it be said further, that if in the past <span style="">the complainant had not been reimbursed his expenses which he had
incurred in similar instances, the reason could only be that the claim for
reimbursement had not been legally and vigorously pursued."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As to the allegation that his conduct in
chambers when complainant was explaining his inability to appear was unbecoming
a judge, respondent Judge stated the following: "In fairness to the
complainant, the undersigned does not hesitate to state that the complainant
was very courteous when he was talking to the undersigned in chambers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the undersigned had no reason to
be discourteous, as he was not in fact so, to the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, after hearing the
complainant's explanation, the undersigned told the complainant that the
respondent, while sympathizing with the complainant for the latter's
experiences (<u>sic</u>) of having spent his own funds for trips made as a
witness in criminal cases, there was no way out of the predicament except to
obey the subpoena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And after considering
the complainant's explanation, the undersigned issued an order in chambers
accepting the explanation as satisfactory and ordering at the same time the
immediate release of the complainant, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issuance of the said order is inconsistent with the claim of
complainant that his explanation made in chambers was ignored by the
undersigned."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then referred to the Acting Assistant Judicial
Consultant Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Relova</span> of the Court of Appeals for
study, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
memorandum submitted to the Court dated June 29, 1977, after setting forth the
above facts and in the light of People v. <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
he recommended that the charges be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He explained why: "It is submitted, therefore, that Respondent cannot
be administratively held liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold
otherwise would be allowing a [disregard] of the coercive power of the courts
to compel attendance in court of cited witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Section 5(e) of Rule 135
of the Rules of Court).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
not to mention the very satisfactory explanation of the Respondent on all the
charges imputed against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, Complainant was furnished a copy of the comment/explanation
of Respondent as early as <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="7">July 15,
 1975</st1:date> * * *, but up to now, no reply was ever received by the Court
from Complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem that
Complainant is satisfied of the explanation of respondent Judge."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court accepts such recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The afore-cited case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span> is in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decisive question therein raised is whether a court of first
instance hearing a criminal case may compel by subpoena the attendance of a
witness in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
when the known address of such witness is at <span class="SpellE">Montalban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
argued that under the Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>a witness is not bound to attend a
hearing if held outside the province he resides unless the distance <span class="GramE">be</span> less than 50 kilometers from his residence to the place
of trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such contention did not
command the assent of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:
"It is loathe <span class="GramE">to clip</span> what undoubtedly is the
inherent power of the Court to compel the attendance of persons to testify in a
case pending therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 9 of Rule
23 is thus interpreted to apply solely to civil cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A recognition of such power in a court of
first instance conducting the trial of an accused may be gleaned from principle
that justifies it when satisfied 'by proof or oath, that there is reason to
believe that a material witness for the prosecution will not appear and testify
when required,' to order that he 'give bail in sum as [it]<span style=""> </span>may deem proper for such
appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon refusal <span style="">to </span>give bail, the court must commit
him to prison until he complies or is legally discharged.' Under the
circumstances, in view of the serious handicap to which the prosecution would
thus be subjected in proving its case, the order of respondent <span style="">judge denying the motion for an order of
arrest or a citation for contempt in the alternative, based on a clear
misapprehension of the Rules of Court, could be viewed as amounting to grave
abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would follow
then that respondent Judge should decide said motion without taking into
consideration Section 9 of Rule 23."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> What was done by Judge <span class="SpellE">Quitain</span>
was, therefore, within his discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no grave abuse of authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor can the accusation of conduct unbecoming a judge be taken
seriously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
v. De <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> it was held: "As far as the behavior of
a trial judge is concerned, however, it is not realistic to assume, considering
the nature and the burden laid on his shoulders, that he will at all times
personify equanimity."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Even if his conduct in chambers did not </span><span style="">live </span><span style="">up fully then to the demands of politeness and courtesy, disciplinary
action does not lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as shown
in the memorandum of Acting Judicial Consultant, the fact that he did not even
bother to refute the allegation of respondent Judge that he behaved as a
gentleman should during their talk in chambers may justifiably lead to the
inference that complainant, on calmer reflection with his resentment diminishing
with the passage of time, may have decided not to press this particular
accusation anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
