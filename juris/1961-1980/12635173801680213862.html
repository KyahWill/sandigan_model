				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant </span><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallora</span> was charged
with murder in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del Norte, found guilty and sentenced to suffer the penalty <span style="">of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
</span>and to pay the heirs of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elliadora</span>, an indemnity of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime was committed in the evening of <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1959</st1:date>, at barrio <span class="SpellE">Soso</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span></st1:placename></st1:place> in <span style="">the </span>aforesaid province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Elliadora</span> and his
wife, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>, <span style="">were
asleep </span>in their small <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut, together with
their three young children, when at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
<span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> was suddenly awakened by an unusual sound, as
if some object had fallen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the light
of a small kerosene lamp placed on top of <span style="">a
</span>trunk near the door of the room, she saw <span style="">her </span>husband lying wounded on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two men were standing near him, each with a
flashlight and a blood-stained knife in either hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felisa's</span> testimony
is that she recognized one of them to be <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallora</span>, as the handkerchief he had used to cover his face
had slipped down, but that <span style="">she did </span>not
know who the other was since he still had his face hidden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her call for help scared the two men away,
both of them exiting through the window, by which same opening they had
evidently gained access inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Andres <span class="SpellE">Argonitas</span>, a cousin of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>,
who said he was at the yard of his house a few meters away, about to chop some
firewood with which to cook food for his ailing child, responded to the
call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he reached the yard of <span class="SpellE">Felisa's</span> house, he said, he happened to direct the beam of
his flashlight at the fleeing men and thereby recognized appellant, but not the
companion.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> and Andres turned their
attention to the wounded man he was already lifeless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had sustained six wounds, four in the
region of the chest and two <span style="">in </span>the
left thigh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal health officer
who examined the body the next morning pronounced that death must <span style="">have been instantaneous, principally from the
punctured wound one inch below </span>the left nipple.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of the testimony of the widow and of Andres <span class="SpellE">Argonitas</span>, the trial court returned a verdict of
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main issue in this appeal
involves the sufficiency of the evidence identifying appellant as the culprit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motive indirectly ascribed for <span style="">the </span>killing was <span style="">robbery,
although there is </span>nothing <span style="">in </span>the
record to show that anything of <span style="">value
was </span>taken from the victim's house that fatal evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>,
some <span style="">six </span>days before she sold 40
<span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of corn at a corn mill for P200.00, and
appellant was then nearby, and conceivably <span class="GramE">saw</span> her
receive the said amount in payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, she testified, on <st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="3">March
 9, 1959</st1:date>, or four days prior to the incident, a certain <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> paid for P60.00 in her house to redeem a mortgage,
and appellant was then passing by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
obvious that the evidence of the supposed motive is too tenuous to be given credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denied the charge against him, <span style="">and denied </span>likewise that he saw, or was even present, when <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> was paid the <span style="">two </span>sums of money referred to in her
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's house was about
600 meters away from that of the deceased, and from eight <span style="">in the evening of March 13 to </span>past <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, according to his testimony, he was at
the house of his next door neighbor, Felix <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span>, a
former municipal policeman of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span> had just
arrived that afternoon from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where he went in the morning
to attend to a loan application he had with the local branch of the Philippine
National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant came to visit
with him and to inquire about his application.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other neighbors also came, but at about 10 o'clock <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span>
ex­cused himself to eat his supper, and afterwards to catch some chickens for
roasting as the next morning he had an appointment with the bank inspector,
with whom he was to go to his land in <span class="SpellE">Doblestan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caromatan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, in
connection with the loan, and the chickens were to be their provision for the
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant offered to help <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They caught
three of the fowls roosting in a tree nearby, then slaughtered and roasted them
one by one, and even ate the internal organs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant took his leave after <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
and went back to his house just a few meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About five minutes afterwards, as <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span> was pre­paring to sleep, the barrio sub-lieutenant,
<span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Clarion, arrived and called him from outside,
telling him to wake up because somebody had been killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took his flashlight, went downstairs and
proceeded to Clarion's house, which was also nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A certain Vicente <span class="SpellE">Yanong</span>
was there, together with a companion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was Vicente who had brought the <span style="">news </span>of
the killing and who, when asked by <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span>, informed
the latter that <span class="SpellE">Quintino</span> (<span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elliadora</span>) had been killed but that assailant was
unknown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Gallora</span>
himself, who had heard the courier calling to <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span>,
followed the latter to Clarions house, and while there was requested by <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span> to write down a report of the incident as dictated
by him, to be signed by the barrio sub-lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report was prepared and signed
accordingly and then taken by rural policeman Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lan­taca</span>,
accompanied by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Yanong</span> and several others, to
the chief of police in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span> nor appellant went to the house of the victim im­mediately
after they were informed of the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing, in substance, was the mutually corroborative
testimony of Felix <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span> and of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Continuing his own narration, appellant said that at <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30</st1:time> in the morning of the next day, March 14,
the municipal health officer of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>, Dr.
Rodolfo Padua, arrived in a jeep at appellant's place, accompanied by the chief
of police and one patrolman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They called
him and asked him to take them to the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He rode with them in the jeep and together
they went inside the house where the dead man was lying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of police interrogated the widow,
asking her particularly if she recognized the killer, but she answered she did
not be­cause the killer's face was covered with a handkerchief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
same question was put to Andres <span class="SpellE">Argonitas</span>, who
likewise could not make any identification because he was, he </span><span style="">said, in </span><span style="">his house at the time the crime was </span><span style="">committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing testimony of appellant <span style="">is </span>corroborated by Dr. Padua and by the chief of police himself,
both of whom testified that during the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
examination of the body of the deceased as well as during the latter's spot
investigation appellant was present.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nobody pointed an accusing finger at him; the widow simply said she did
not recognize the person who killed her husband because his face was covered at
the time.</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be noted, the <span style="">whole
case against appellant depends on </span>the identification made by the widow, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Elliadora</span>, and her cousin
Andres <span class="SpellE">Argonitas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, it <span style="">is </span>a
slender thread indeed by which to hang a finding of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, there is no reasonable explanation why
both of them did not denounce appellant and identify him as the killer when
they were investigated by the chief of police in the morning after the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felisa's</span>
excuse that her voice was hoarse from crying <span style="">is </span>certainly too lame to be credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for Andres, he said at the trial that he
was afraid he himself might be killed if he should point to appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the fact <span style="">is </span>that both he and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Felisa</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> did so one week later, that is, on <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1959</st1:date>, when they signed their respective
written statements; and Andres did not explain why he was no longer afraid
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the motive attributed to
appellant rests on a very shaky foundation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He denied having been present on the two occasions when <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> was paid the <span style="">sums
</span>of P200 and P60, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
if the motive <span style="">was
</span>robbery, the <span style="">precipitate killing
</span><span style="">of </span>the victim would seem
entirely necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A preliminary threat
and demand for the money would have been the logical step for the malefactors
to take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it is quite
strange that with her hus­band sleeping beside her <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
did not wake up until after the six wounds had been inflicted, without catching
any part of the actual physical aggression.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thirdly, it <span style="">is </span>no less
strange that Andres would be chopping wood in the middle of the night, and
using a scythe instead of a bolo or an axe for the purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A minor contradiction between his testimony
and that of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> thus acquires significance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>while according to Andres he had not yet
started to chop wood when he heard <span class="SpellE">Felisa's</span> call for
help, the latter that she knew he was in the yard because she heard the sound
of chopping immediately after she awoke.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An intriguing fact in
this case was not thoroughly explored at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point in his testimony appel­lant said
that after the investigation in the morning of March 14, conducted by the chief
of police at the scene of the crime, "they (evidently referring to the
chief of police and the patrolman with him) brought with them two
persons." Pressed for an explanation, appellant continued:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When the chief of police went downstairs from the house of
the widow he saw a man walking from the farm with a handkerchief hanging from
the pocket and the chief of police took the handkerchief and said that there
was blood and he said that that was the mask used by the killer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The man's name, according to appellant, was "<span class="SpellE">Lesajero</span>,"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">+</span></span></a> and his
companion was <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> <span class="SpellE">Seban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant did not know if they were
subsequently charged with the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Felix <span class="SpellE">Pacunla</span> testified, however, that when he
arrived home <st1:date year="1959" day="15" month="3">Sunday, March 15, 1959</st1:date>,
after having gone to his land with the bank inspector the previous day, March
14, "there was one Luis <span class="SpellE">Ajero</span> who was detained
in the municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span> <span style="">as </span>the suspected killer of <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span> <span class="SpellE">Elliadora</span>, but on the
following day, Monday, he was released."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial Judge himself
took note of this fact in his decision, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After the investigation conducted by the Chief of Police on <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1959</st1:date> two persons were
brought to the municipal building <span style="">as </span>suspects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the Chief of Police came down, he saw a man with a handkerchief
dangling out of his pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was
a certain Angel <span class="SpellE">Ajero</span> (sic) who upon being confronted
by the widow, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Elliadora</span>
<span class="SpellE">Guardiaquivil</span>, the same said that it was the very
handkerchief that was used as mask.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
charge was filed against any of the two suspects."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Apparently His <span style="">Honor </span>attached
no importance to the foregoing circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, no reason for such cavalier attitude has been given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly if the handkerchief used as <span style="">a </span>mask was identified, it constituted
a damning piece of evidence and should not have been dismissed without a
satisfactory accounting of its possession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court refused
to believe appellant’s alibi on the ground that Felix <span class="SpellE">Pacunla's</span>
corroborative testimony was incredible, since he admitted on cross-examination
that the person for whom he prepared the roasted chickens never came the
following morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pacunla</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">did
not say that that person was coming; what he did say was that they had an agreement
to meet in </span><span style="">the municipal
building of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>, from where they would </span><span style="">proceed to the land to be inspected, which
was situated </span><span style="">in yet another
place, namely, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dobleston</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Caramotan</span>, of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">same province.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The corroborated alibi of
appellant; the fact that he did not hesitate to go with the municipal
authorities to the scene of the crime; the failure of the two material
witnesses for the prosecution to identify him when </span><span style="">identification would </span><span style="">have been most timely and in accord with
natural human reaction; the absence of evidence concerning motivation; and the
finding of the tell-tale handkerchief in the </span><span style="">posses</span><span style="">sion of another
person - all these circumstances cannot but cast a grave doubt as to the guilt
of appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, the judgment appealed from is reversed and
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallora</span>
is acquitted of the charge and ordered forthwith released from detention, with
costs <u>de</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
