				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the decision of the Court of First Instance of Bohol (in Civil Case No. 
1221) upholding (1) the validity of Ordinance No. 2, series of 1958, enacted by 
the Municipal Council of Tagbilaran, Bohol, abolishing the 100-meter requirement 
(from any public building, school, hospital or church) on any cockpit operated 
in said municipality, as established by Ordinance No. 12, series of 1956, and 
(2) the legality of the operation of a cockpit, by Eugenio Inting, et al., 
within 100 meters from the buildings of the Rafael Palma College, plaintiffs 
Marcelo B. Sarmiento, et al., interpose the instant appeal.
<p>The records show that on September 1, 1956, the Municipal Council of 
Tagbilaran, Bohol, passed Ordinance No. 12, series of 1956, amending Ordinance 
No. 2, series of 1954, providing, in its pertinent parts, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1.—It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, partnership or 
entity to establish, maintain and operate nightclubs, cabarets, dancing schools, 
pavilions, cockpits, bars, saloons, bowling alleys, billiard and pool halls, and 
other similar places of amusement without first securing a permit from the 
Office of the Mayor and paying therewith the prescribed permit and license fees 
to the Municipal Treasurer in accordance with existing ordinances; PROVIDED, 
HOWEVER, That no such places of amusement mentioned herein shall be established, 
maintained and/or operated within a radius of TWO HUNDRED (200) lineal meters in 
the case of nightclubs, cabarets, pavilions, or other similar places, and <i>ONE 
HUNDRED</i> (100) <i>lineal meters in the case of cockpits</i>, and FIFTY (50) 
lineal meters in the case of dancing schools, etc. * * * from any public 
building, school, hospital and church * * *.</p>
<p>"SECTION 2.—For any violation of this ordinance where the violator is a 
corporation, partnership or entity, the manager, director, partner, or any 
person connected with or in charge of the establishment shall be liable; in 
other cases the licensee shall be liable." (Italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>On August 1, 1957, Valeriano Manungolh applied to the Municipal Mayor (of 
Tagbilaran, Bohol) for a permit to construct a cockpit in Remolador street, same 
municipality. Said application, however, was denied, the proposed construction 
being within 100 lineal meters from the stage of the Rafael Palma College.</p>
<p>On December 26, 1957, Eugenio Inting applied for a Mayor's permit to operate 
a cockpit in the same Remolador street. The application was properly transmitted 
to the Highway District Engineer for certification as to the suitability of the 
building for the purpose stated therein. On January 8, 1958, Venerando Dumagdag, 
an employee in the Office of the District Engineer, who was assigned to conduct 
the proper investigation of the proposed construction, made the following 
indorsement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"3rd Indorsement<br>"January 8, 1958</p>
<p>"Respectfully returned to Mr. Segundo C. Gloria, District Engineer, 
Tagbilaran, Bohol, with the information that the above mentioned cockpit is 
suitable for occupancy and is one hundred thirty one meters away from the 
nearest public building, the Rafael Palma College."</p>

<p>Acting upon this favorable recommendation, which was adopted by the District 
Engineer, the Municipal Mayor issued the corresponding permit to applicant 
Inting.</p>
<p>On January 14, and 27, 1953, Marcelo B. Sarmiento, a duly licensed cockpit 
operator since 1951 (Exh. A), wrote to the District Engineer informing the 
latter that Inting's cockpit is actually 84.80 meters only from the Music 
building of the Rafael Palma College, and 93.20 meters from the building of the 
Elementary Department of the same school and, therefore, not suitable for 
occupancy as previously certified to by the Engineer's Office. (Exhs. F and 
F-3).</p>
<p>Sarmiento similarly called the attention of the Municipal Council of 
Tagbilaran to this defect, and said body, in response thereto, passed a 
resolution on February 3, 1958, reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"RESOLUTION No. 5</p>
<p>"WHEREAS, a letter has been received by this body from Mr. Marcelo B. 
Sarmiento dated January 27, 1958 requesting that the cockpit of Mr. Eugenio 
Inting situated along Remolador St. of the Poblacion, Tagbilaran, be immediately 
closed because according to him it is constructed within the prohibited 
zone;</p>
<p>"WHEREAS, the power to issue permits for the operation and maintenance of 
cockpits and other amusement places and the closure of the same is a prerogative 
of the Mayor;</p>
<p>"NOW THEREFORE, on motion of Councilor Constancio Saligumba, duly seconded by 
Councilor Fortunato Navea,</p>
<p>"RESOLVED, as it is hereby resolved, that Mr. Marcelo Sarmiento <i>be advised 
to go to the Court of Justice for all his satisfaction</i>.</p>
<p>"UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED." (Exh. F-4; italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On Sarmiento's persistent representations, Dumagdag wrote a letter to the 
District Engineer of Tagbilaran, Bohol, in the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>

matter published in the Bohol Chronicle of February 2, 1958 issue, more 
particularly about the distance of the cockpit of Mr. Eugenio Inting from the

gathered by Mr. Vidal C. Fabiosa in his investigation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The cockpit in question is <i>76.80 meters from the RPC Music 
Building</i>;<br>"2. The said cockpit is <i>76.72 meters from the RPC Elementary 
Department</i>;<br>"3. The said cockpit is 131.10 meters from the main building 
of the Rafael Palma College.</p></blockquote>

<p>Confronted with the foregoing letter, indorsed by the District Engineer, the 
Municipal Mayor made the following indorsement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"3rd Indorsement<br>"February 7, 1958</p>

<p>(Exh. G-4)</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently not satisfied with the action taken on his petitions by the 
municipal officials concerned, Sarmiento brought the matter to the attention of 
the President of the Philippines who, through the Acting Assistant Executive 
Secretary, requested the Municipal Council of Tagbilaran to investigate and 
submit a report on the complaint of Sarmiento. (Exh. H-2). The Mayor's attention 
was also called by the following communication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"1st Indorsement<br>"Manila, February 14, 1958</p>
<p>"Respectfully referred, thru the Provincial Governor, Tagbilaran, Bohol, to

Menoza, Valeriano Manongoen and Eugenio Inting</i>, and our telegram of even

Engineer of that province, the said cockpit is 84.80 meters and 93.20 meters 
from the Rafael Palma College Music House and Rafael Palma College Elementary 
Building, respectively, in violation of said ordinance. In view thereof, it is 
requested that the owners of said cockpit be required to transfer it to a place

<p>On February 17, 1958, or 3 days after the Mayor received the above directives 
from the Office of the President, the Municipal Council of Tagbilaran, through 
Ordinance No. 2, series of 1958, <i>amended</i> Ordinance No. 12, series of 
1956, to read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1.—It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation partnership or

<p align="right">"Approved, February 17, 1958."</p>
<p>(Exh. I-1; Italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>Marcelo Sarmiento, et al., thereafter filed a complaint in the Court of First 
Instance of Bohol against the Municipal Mayor, the Council and cockpit operators 
Inting, et al., claiming damages for losses allegedly sustained by them as a 
result of the issuance of the questioned permit to the latter. The defendants 
duly filed their answers thereto, justifying the issuance of the permit and 
sustaining its validity.</p>
<p>On March 23, 1959, the court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint on 
the ground that, as the Municipal Council, under Republic Act 1224, has 
authority to abolish the distance requirements on cockpits and that, at the time 
the complaint was filed, the operation by Inting, et al., of the cockpit within 
a distance of less than 100 meters from a school building was no longer 
prohibited, plaintiffs had no cause of action against the defendants. Hence, 
this appeal.</p>
<p>As correctly stated by the lower court, the controversy in the instant case 
hinges on the validity of Ordinance No. 2, series of 1958, of the Municipal 
Council of Tagbilaran, Bohol, abolishing the distance requirement on cockpits 
previously imposed by Ordinance No. 12, series of 1956. However, the ordinance 
in question should have been declared null and void and without effect.</p>
<p>Republic Act No. 1224, amending Republic Acts Nos. 938 and 979, relied upon 
by the appellee and the trial court, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. The * * * municipal council of each municipality and municipal 
district shall have the power to regulate or prohibit by ordinance the 
establishment, maintenance and operation of night clubs, cabarets, dancing 
schools, pavilions, <i>cockpits</i>, bars, saloons, bowling alleys, billiard 
pools, and other similar places of amusement within its territorial 
jurisdiction:</p>
<p><i>Provided, however,</i> That no such places of amusement mentioned herein 
shall be established, maintained and/or operated within a radius of two hundred 
lineal meters in the case of night clubs, cabarets, pavilions, or other similar 
places, and fifty lineal meters in the case of dancing schools, bars, saloons, 
billiard, pools, bowling alleys, or other similar places, <i>except cockpits, 
the distance of which shall be left to the discretion of the municipal</i> or 
city board or <i>council, from any public building, schools, hospitals, and 
churches: Provided, further,</i> That no municipal or city ordinance fixing 
distances at which such places of amusement may be established or operated shall 
apply to those already licensed and operating at the time of the enactment of 
such municipal or city ordinance, nor will the subsequent opening of any public 
building or other premises from which distances shall be measured prejudice any 
place of amusement already then licensed and operating, but any such place of 
amusement established within fifty lineal meters from any school, hospital or 
church shall be so constructed that the noise coming therefrom shall not disturb 
those in the school, hospital or church, and, if such noise causes such 
disturbance then such place of amusement shall not operate during school hours 
when near a school, or at night when near a hospital, or when there are 
religious services near a church; * * *" (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the contention of appellee, upheld by the trial court that since the 
law expressly left the fixing of the distance of cockpits from any public 
building, schools, hospitals, and churches to the discretion of the municipal 
council, the latter could validly do away with any distance at all, as it did in 
passing the questioned ordinance. This, we believe, is not the intention of the 
law.</p>
<p>Under the abovequoted provision, a municipal or city council is expressly 
empowered <i>either to prohibit entirely or merely regulate</i> the operation 
and maintenance of certain places of amusement by imposing a distance limitation 
thereon, from any public building, schools, hospitals and churches, specifying a 
distance of 200 lineal meters in cases of nightclubs and other establishments of 
similar nature, and 50 lineal meters in cases of bars, saloons, etc. However, 
with respect to cockpits, the law gave the local law-making body the discretion 
to determine the appropriate distance to be observed, probably on the theory 
that cockpit, having its own peculiarities, the municipal council is in a better 
position to understand the needs of its constituents. From this it cannot be 
logically inferred that cockpits can be freely established at any place and be 
exempt from observing certain distance from public building, schools, etc. The 
authority to determine the distance does not carry with it the authority to 
exempt cockpits from observing any distance at all. That the Legislature did not 
intend to give the council such authority to dispense entirely with the distance 
limitation in case of cockpits, is evident from the fact that even in those 
cases specifically declared exempted from any ordinance fixing distances,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> the law requires the observance of certain 
restrictions designed to promote the peace, health and general welfare of the 
community. Appellee Municipal Council, therefore, could not, under Republic Act 
No. 1224, abolish an already existing distance requirement on cockpit and 
provide no distance limitation at all on the operation of such amusement 
place.</p>
<p>It also appears, as bared by the recital of facts heretofore made, that when 
appellant Sarmiento called the attention of the Mayor and Municipal Council on 
the operation of a cockpit within the prohibited area, instead of doing 
something on his protest, said local authorities merely directed him to "go to 
courts"; that three days after the Mayor was required by the Office of the 
President to explain why permit was issued to appellees Inting, et al., an 
apparently accommodating Council enacted the ordinance in question, abolishing 
the distance requirement of 100 meters, and making it retroactive to May 17, 
1955. All this, taken with the fact that although a permit to operate a cockpit 
in Remolador Street was previously denied to Valeriano Manungolh, on the ground 
that the proposed construction was within 100 lineal meters from the Rafael 
Palma College's stage, such a permit was subsequently issued to Eugenio Inting 
(who turned out to be co-partner of Fermin Torralba, Cecilio Meñoza and the same 
Valeriano Manungolh) for the operation of a cockpit also in Remolador Street, 
which is likewise within 100 lineal meters from a building of the Rafael Palma 
College, clearly indicates, to our mind, that the enactment of Ordinance No. 2, 
series of 1958, abolishing the distance requirement of 100 lineal meters on 
cockpit operations as imposed by Ordinance No. 12, series of 1956, and making it 
retroactive to May 17, 1955, was intended solely to favor a person or group of 
persons, and therefore, is null and void for being partial. (U.S. <i>vs</i>. 
Abendan, 24 Phil., 165: see also Pedro <i>vs</i>. Provincial Board of Rizal, 56 
Phil., 123).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, and we declare null and 
void Ordinance No. 2, series of 1958, insofar as it abolishes the distance 
limitation on cockpits, and hold that the cockpit operated by appellees, Inting, 
et al., violates the provisions of Ordinance No. 12, series of 1956, of the 
Municipal Council of Tagbilaran. The permit heretofore issued to said appellees 
is consequently hereby declared null and void. There being no assignment of 
error regarding the damages allegedly suffered by appellants, and finding no 
evidence on record regarding such claim for damages, no award therefore can be 
made. Costs are taxed against appellees Inting, et al. So 
ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,
