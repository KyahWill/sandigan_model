<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Commission on

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 27, 1976,
PABLO C. SANIDAD and PABLITO V. SANIDAD, father and son, commenced L-44640 for
Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction seeking to enjoin the Commission on
Elections from holding and conducting the Referendum-Plebiscite on October 16;
to declare without force and effect Presidential Decree Nos. 991 and 1033,

Decree No. 1031, insofar as it directs the Commission on Elections to
supervise, control, hold, and conduct the Referendum-Plebiscite scheduled on
October 16, 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners contend that
under the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions there is no grant to the incumbent
President to exercise the constituent power to propose amendments to the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the
Referendum-Plebiscite on October 16 has no constitutional or legal basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="10"><span style="">October
 5, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, the

Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
principally maintains that petitioners have no standing to sue; the issue
raised is political in nature, beyond judicial cognizance of this Court; at
this state of the transition period, only the incumbent President has the
authority to exercise constituent power; the referendum-plebiscite is a step
towards norma­lization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 30, 1976,
another action for Prohi­bition with Preliminary Injunction, docketed as
L-44684, was instituted by V ICENT M. GUZMAN, a delegate to the 1971 Constitutional
Convention, asserting that the power to propose amendments to, or revision of,
the Constitution during the transition period is expressly conferred on the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly under Section 16, Article XVII of the Constitution.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

 5, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> by RAUL M.
GONZALES, his son RAUL, JR., and ALFREDO SALAPANTAN, docketed as L-44714, to
restrain the implementation of Presidential Decrees relative to the forthcoming
Referendum-Plebiscite of October 16.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These last petitioners
argue that even granting him legislative powers under Martial Law, the
incumbent President cannot act as a constituent assembly to propose amendments
to the Constitution; a referendum-plebiscite is untenable under the
Constitutions of 1935 and 1973; the submission of the proposed amendments in
such a short period of time for deliberation renders the plebiscite a nullity;
to lift Martial Law, the President need not consult the people <u>via</u>
referendum; and allowing 15-year olds to vote would amount to an amendment of
the Constitution, which confines the right of suffrage to those citizens of the
Philippines 18 years of age and above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

public funds may be enjoined, upon the theory that the expenditure </span><i>of
public funds by an officer of </i><span style="">the

</span>Moreover, as regards taxpayer's suits, this Court enjoys that open discretion
to entertain the same or not.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> For the present case, We deem it sound to
exercise that discretion affirmatively so that the authority upon which the
disputed Decrees are predicated may be inquired into.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
would consider the question at bar as a pure political one, lying outside the
domain of judicial review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amending process, both as
to proposal and ratification, raises a judicial question.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This is especially true in cases <span style="">where
the power of the Presidency to initiate the amend­ing process by proposals of
amendments, a function normally exercised by the legislature, is seriously
doubted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the 1973
Constitution, the power to propose amendments to the Constitution resides in
the <u>interim</u> National Assembly during the period of transition (Sec. 15,
Transitory Provisions).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that
period, and the regular National Assembly in its active session, the power to
propose amendments becomes <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> the prerogative of the
regular National Assembly (Sec. 1, pars. 1 and 2 of Art. XV I, 1973
Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The normal course has not
been followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than calling the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly to constitute itself into a constituent assembly, the
incumbent President undertook the proposal of amendments and submitted the
proposed amendments thru Presidential Decree 1033 to the people in a
Referendum-Plebiscite on October 16.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unavoidably, the regularity of the procedure for amendments, written in
lambent words in the very Constitution sought to be amended, raises a
contestable issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The implementing
Presidential Decree Nos. 991, 1031, and 1033, which commonly purport to have
the force and effect of legislation are assailed as invalid, thus the issue of
the validity of said Decrees is plainly a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
one, within the competence of this Court to pass upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2 (2), Article X of the new
Constitution provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"All cases
involving the constitutionality of a treaty, executive agreement, <u>or law</u>
shall be heard and decided by the Supreme Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, and no
treaty, executive agreement, or law may be declared unconstitutional without
the concurrence of at least ten Members. * * *." The Supreme Court has the
last word in the construction not only of treaties and statutes, but also of
the Constitution itself.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The amending, like all other powers
organized in the Constitution, is in form a delegated and hence a limited
power, so that the Supreme Court is vested with that authority to determine
whether that power has been discharged within its limits.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Political questions are
neatly associated with the wisdom, <u>not</u> the legality of a particular
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the <u>vortex</u> of the
controversy refers to the legality or validity of the contested act, that
matter is definitely <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> or
non-political.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is in the heels of
the Court is not the wisdom of the act of the incumbent President in pro­posing
amendments to the Constitution, <u>but</u> his constitutional authority to
perform such act or to assume the power of a constituent assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the amending process confers on the
President that power to propose amendments is therefore a downright <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Should the contrary be found, the actuation of the President would merely
be a <span class="SpellE"><u>brutum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>fulmen</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Constitution provides how it may be
amended, the judiciary as the interpreter of that Constitution, can declare
whether the procedure followed or the authority assumed was valid or not.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot accept the view
of the Solicitor General, in pursuing his theory of non-<span class="SpellE">justiciability</span>,
that the question of the President's authority to propose amendments and the
regularity of the procedure adopted for submission of the proposals to the
people ultimately lie in the judgment of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A clear Descartes fallacy of <u>vicious</u> <u>circle</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it not that the people themselves, by
their sovereign act, provided for the authority and procedure for the amending
process when they ratified the present Constitution in 1973?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether, therefore, that constitutional
provision has been followed or not is indisputably a proper subject of inquiry,
not by the people themselves - of course - who exercise no power of judicial
review, but by the Supreme Court in whom the people themselves vested that
power, a power which includes the competence to determine whether the
constitutional norms for amendments have been observed or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, this inquiry must be done a <u>priori</u>
not <u>a</u> <u>posteriori</u>, i.e., before the submission to and ratification
by the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, the precedents
evolved by the Court on prior constitutional cases underline the preference of
the Court's majority to treat such issue of Presidential role in the amending
process as one of non-political impression.<span style="">&nbsp;

Constitutional Convention and appropriating funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,

validity of Presidential Proclamation No. 1102, "announcing the Ratification
by the Filipino people of the Constitution proposed by the 1971 Constitutional
Convention," partakes of the nature of a political question, the
affirmative stand of the Solicitor General was dismissed, the Court ruled that
the question raised is <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,

Decree No. 73 calling a plebiscite to be held on January 15, 1973, for the

was not a proper subject of judicial inquiry because, they claimed, it partook
of a political nature, and We <u>unanimously</u> declared that the issue was a <span class="SpellE"><u>justiciable</u></span> one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>With identical unanimity</u>, We overruled the respondents'

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><u>Concentration of Powers in the
President during crisis government.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general, the
governmental powers in crisis government - the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a crisis government today - are more or less concentrated in the President.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
According to <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span>, "(t)he concentration of
government power in a democracy faced by an emergency is a corrective to the
crisis inefficiencies inherent in the doctrine of the separation of
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In most <st1:state><st1:place>free
  states</st1:place></st1:state> it has generally been regarded as imperative
that the <span style="">total power of the government
be parceled out among three mutually independent branches - executive,
legislature, and judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
believed to be destructive of constitutionalism if any one branch should
exercise any two or more types of power, and certainly a total disregard of the
separation of powers is, as Madison wrote in the Federalist, No. 47, 'the very
definition of tyranny.' <u>In normal times the separation of powers forms a
distinct obstruction to arbitrary governmental action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this same token, in abnormal times it may
form an insurmountable barrier to a decisive emergency action in behalf of the
state and its independent existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are moments in the life of any government when all powers must
work together in unanimity of purpose and action, even if this means the
temporary union of executive, legislative, and judicial power in the hands of
one man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more complete the
separation of powers in a constitutional system, the more difficult and yet the
more necessary will be their fusion in time of crisis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident in a comparison of the crisis
potentialities of the cabinet and presidential systems of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the former the all-important harmony of
legislature and executive is taken for granted; in the latter it is neither
guaranteed nor to be to confidently expected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result, cabinet is more easily established and more trustworthy
than presidential dictatorship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
power of the state in crisis must not only be concentrated and expanded; it
must also be freed from the normal system of constitutional and legal
limitations</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> John Locke, on the other hand, claims for

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">"It
is unthinkable," said Justice Fernandez, a 1971 Constitutional Convention
delegate, "that the Constitutional Convention, while giving to the
President the discretion when to call the interim National Assembly to session,
and knowing that it may not be convened soon, would create a vacuum in the
exercise of legislative powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, with no one to exercise the lawmaking powers, there would be <span class="SpellE">paralyzation</span> of the entire governmental machinery."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Paraphrasing <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span>,
this is an extremely important factor in any constitutional dictatorship which
extends over a period of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
separation of executive and legislature ordained in the Constitution presents a
distinct obstruction to efficient crisis govern­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The steady increase in executive power is not
too much a cause for worry as the steady increase in the magnitude and
complexity of the problems the President has been called upon by the Filipino
people to solve in their behalf, which involve rebellion, subversion,
secession, recession, inflation, and economic crisis - a crisis greater than
war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, while conventional
constitutional law just confines the President's power as Commander-in-Chief to
the direction of the operation of the national forces, yet the facts of our
political, social, and economic disturbances had convincingly shown that in
meeting the same, indefinite power should be attributed to the President to
take emergency measures.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

out, the power to legislate is constitutionally consigned to the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly during the transition period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the initial convening of that Assembly is a matter fully
addressed to the judgment of the incumbent President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in the exercise of that judgment, the
President opted to defer the convening of that body in utter recognition of the
people's preference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in the
period of transition, the power to propose amendments to the Constitution lies
in the <u>interim</u> National Assembly upon special call by the President
(Sec. 15 of the Transitory Provisions).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, harking to the dictates of the sovereign will, the President
decided not to call the <u>interim</u> National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would it then be within the bounds of the
Constitution and of law for <span style="">the
President to assume that constituent power of the <u>interim</u> Assembly <span class="SpellE"><u>vis</u>-<u>a</u>-<u>vis</u></span> his assumption of that
body's legislative functions?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer
is yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the President has been
legitimately discharging the legislative functions of the <u>interim</u>
Assembly, there is no reason why he cannot validly discharge the function of
that Assembly to propose amendments to the Constitution, which is but adjunct,
although peculiar, to it s gross legislative power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, of course, is not to say that the
President has converted his office into a constituent assembly of that nature
normally constituted by the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, with the <u>interim</u> National Assembly not convened and only
the Presidency and the Supreme Court in operation, the urges of absolute
necessity render it imperative upon the President to act as agent for and in
behalf of the people to propose amendments to the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, by its very consti­tution,
the Supreme Court possesses no capacity to propose amendments without
constitutional infractions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
President to shy away from that actuality and decline to undertake the amending
process would leave the governmental machinery at a <span class="SpellE">stalmate</span>
or create in the powers of the State a destructive vacuum, thereby impeding the
objective of a crisis government "to end the crisis and re­store normal
times." In these parlous times, that Presi­dential initiative to reduce
into concrete forms the constant voices of the people reigns supreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, constituent assemblies or
constitutional conventions, like the President now, are mere agents of the
people.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is apt to
distinguish here between a "referendum" and a "plebiscite."
A "referendum" is merely consultative in <span class="SpellE">charact</span>
<span class="SpellE">er</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is simply
a means of assessing public reaction to the given issues submitted to the
people for their consideration, the calling of which is derived from or within
the totality of the executive power of the President.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
It is participated in by all citizens from the age of fifteen, regardless of
whether or not they are illiterates, feeble-minded, or ex-convicts.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
A "plebiscite," on the other hand, involves the constituent act of
those "citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by law, who
are eighteen years of age or over, and who shall have resided in the
Philippines for at least one year and in the place wherein they propose to vote
for at least six months preceding the election."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>

individual liberty, but on certain grounds no total suppression of that liberty
is aimed at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The machinery for the
referendum-plebiscite on October 16 recognizes all the embracing freedoms of expression

women's suffrage amendment to the Constitution before the scheduled plebiscite

published in only three consecutive issues of the Official Gazette for 10 days
prior to the scheduled plebiscite (Corn. Act 492).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the 1940 Constitutional amendments
providing for the bicameral Congress, the reelection of the President and
Vice-President, and the creation of the Commission on Elections, 20 days of
publication in three consecutive issues of the Official Gazette was fixed (Com.
Act No. 517).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the Parity Amendment,
an involved constitutional amendment affecting the economy as well as the
independence of the Republic was publicized in three consecutive issues of the
Official Gazette for 20 days prior to the plebiscite (Rep. Act No. 73)."<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is worthy to note
that Article XVI of the Constitution makes no provision as to the specific date
when the plebiscite shall be held, but simply states that it "shall be
held not later than three months after <span style="">the
approval of such amendment or revision." In <u>Coleman v.

this matter of submission involves "an appraisal of a great variety of
relevant conditions, political, social and economic," which "are
essentially political and not <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>." The
constituent body or in the instant cases, the President, may fix the time
within which the people may act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
because, <u>first</u>, proposal and ratification are not treated as unrelated
acts, but as succeeding steps in a single endeavor, the natural inference being
that they are not to be widely separated in time; <u>second</u>, it is only
when there is deemed to be a necessity <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> that
amendments are to be proposed, the reasonable implication being that when
proposed, they are to be considered and disposed of presently; and <u>third</u>,
ratification is but the expression of the approbation of the people, hence, it

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">At the threshold, it is necessary to clarify what is a
"political question".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must
be noted that this device has been utilized by the judiciary "to avoid
determining questions it is ill equipped to determine or that could be settled
in any event only with the effective support of the political branches."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
According to Weston, judges, whether "personal representatives of a truly
sovereign king, or taking their seats as the creatures of a largely popular
sovereignty speaking through a written constitution, <i><span style="">derive their </span>power </i><i><span style="">by
</span>a delegation, </i>which clearly or obscurely as the case may be,
delineates and delimits their <i>delegated </i>jurisdiction.* * * Judicial
questions * * * are those which the sovereign has set to be decided in the
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Political </i><i><span style="">questions</span></i><span style="">, </span>similarly, are those which the sovereign has entrusted to the
so-called political departments of government or has reserved to be settled by
its own extra-governmental action."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Reflecting a similar concept, this Court has defined a "political
question" as a "matter which is <i>to </i><i><span style="">be </span>exercised by the people </i><i><span style="">in </span>their primary political capacity</i> or that has been
specifically <i>delegated </i>to some other department or particular officer of
the government, with discretionary power to act."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, it refers to those questions which, under the Constitution, are
<i>to </i><i><span style="">be </span>decided by the
people </i><i><span style="">in </span>their s</i><i><span style="">overeign </span>capacity, </i>or in regard to
which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or
executive branch of government.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In determining whether an issue falls within the political
question category, the absence of a satisfactory criterion for a judicial
determination or the appropriateness of attributing finality to the action of
the political departments of government are dominant considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was explained by Justice Brennan in <i>Baker
v. Carr</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve
political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment
of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of
deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial
discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent
resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of
government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political
decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious
pronouncements by various departments on one question. * * *"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">To
</span>decide whether a matter has <span style="">in </span>a
measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government or
retained by the people to be decided by them in their sovereign capacity, or
whether that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed to it, is
indeed a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Coleman v. Millen</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the United States Supreme Court held that the efficacy of the ratification by
state legislatures of a constitutional amendment is a political question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of whether the State
Legislature could constitutionally ratify an amendment, after the same had been
previously rejected by it, it was held that the ultimate authority over the
question was in Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation
of the adopt­ion of the amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
in connection with the second question of whether the amendment has lost its
vitality through the lapse of time, the Court held that the question was
likewise political, involving "as it does * * * an appraisal of a great
variety of relevant conditions, political, social and economic, which can
hardly be said to be within the appropriate range of evidence receivable in a <span style="">court </span>of justice and as to which it
would be an extravagant extension of juridical authority to assert judicial
notice as the basis of deciding a controversy with respect to the validity of
an amendment actually ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, these conditions are appropriate for the consideration of the
political departments of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The questions they involve are essentially political and not
justiciable."</p>

<p class="BODY">In their concurring opinions in <i>Coleman</i>, Justices Black,
Roberts, Frankfurter and Douglas stressed that:</p>

<blockquote>"The Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to control
submission of constitutional amendments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Final determination by Congress that ratification by three-fourths of
the States has taken place 'is conclusive upon the courts.' In the exercise of
that power, Congress, of course, is governed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, whether submission, intervening
procedure for Congressional determination of ratification conforms to the
commands of the Constitution, call for decisions by a 'political department' of
questions of a type which this Court has frequently designated 'political.' And
decision of a 'political question' by the 'political department' to which the
Constitution has committed it 'conclusively binds the judges, as well as all
other officers, citizens and subjects of * * * government.' Proclamation under
authority of Congress that an amendment has been ratified will carry with it a
solemn assurance by the Congress that ratification has taken place as the Constitution
commands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon this assurance a
proclaimed amendment must be accepted as a part of the Constitution, leaving to
the judiciary its traditional authority of interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent that the Court's opinion in the
present case even impliedly assumes a power to make judicial interpretation of
the exclusive constitutional authority of Congress over submission and
ratification of amendments, we are unable to agree."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Relying or the doctrine enunciated in <i>Coleman v. Miller, supra</i>,
this Court, in <i>Mabanag v. Lopez Vito</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>speaking through Mr. Justice Pedro
Tuason, ruled that the process of constitutional amendment, involving proposal
and ratification, is a political question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span style="">the </span><i>Mabanag</i>
case, the petitioners sought to prevent the enforcement of a resolution of
Congress proposing the "Parity Amendment" to the Philippine
Constitution on the ground that it had not been approved by the three-fourths
vote of all the members of each house as required by Article XV of the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was claimed that three
(3) Senators and eight (8) members of the House of Representatives had been
suspended and that their membership was not considered in the determination of
the three-fourths vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In dismissing
the petition on the ground that the question of the validity of the proposal
was political, the Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"If ratification of an amendment is a political question, a
proposal which leads to ratification has to be a political question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two steps complement each other in a
scheme intended to achieve a single objective.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is to he noted that amendatory process as provided in Section 1 of
Article XV of the Philippine Constitution 'consists of (only) two distinct
parts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>proposal and ratification.' There
is no logic in attaching political character to one and withholding that
character from the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proposal to
amend the Constitution is a <i>highly political </i>function performed by the
Contress in its sovereign legislative capa­city and committed to its charge by
the Constitution itself. * * *" (At pages 4-5, italics supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in <i>Gonzales v. Comelec</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court stated that it overruled <i>Mabanag</i> declaring that the issue
whether or not a Resolution of Congress, acting as a constituent assembly ---
violates the Constitution is essentially justiciable, not political, and hence,
subject to judicial review." But it was not necessary for the Court to
have overruled the doctrine enunciated in <i>Mabanag</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was involved in <i>Gonzales</i> was not
the validity of a proposed amendment to the Constitution approved by Congress
in the exercise of its constituent powers but an ordinary statute enacted by
Congress, providing for the submission of certain proposed constitutional
amendments to the people.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, in <i>Tolentino v. Commission on Elections</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
what was involved was not the validity of the proposal to lower the voting age
but rather that of the resolution of the Constitutional Convention submitting
the proposal for ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question was whether all the amendments to be submitted by the same Convention
must be done piecemeal or must be submitted to the people for approval or
rejection in a single "election" or plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case here.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the point has been stressed that the President is acting as
agent for and in behalf of the people in proposing the amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no question that in the
referendum of January, 1973 and in the subsequent referendums the people had
clearly and categorically rejected the calling of the <i>interim</i> National
Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the main opinion,
the <i>Lupong Tagapagpaganap</i> of the <i>Katipunan ng mga</i><i><span style=""> </span>Sanggunian</i>, the <i>Pambansang
Katipunan ng maa Barangay</i> representing 42,000 barangays, the <i>Kabataang
Barangay </i>organizations and the various sectoral groups had proposed the
replacement of the <i>interim</i> National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These barangays and the <i>Sanggunian</i>
assemblies have proven to be effective instrumentalities through which the
desires of the people have been articulated and expressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <i>Batasang Bayan</i> (Legislative
Council), composed of nineteen (19) cabinet members <span style="">and </span>nine (9) officials with cabinet rank, and ninety one (91)
members of the <i>Lupong Tagapagpaganap</i> (Executive Committee) of the <i>Katipunan
ng </i><i><span style="">mga Sangguniang B</span>ayan</i>
voted in their special session to submit directly to the people in a plebiscite
on October 16, 1976 the afore-mentioned constitutional amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These proposed amendments reflected the
desires of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the <i>Pambansang
Katipunan ng </i><i><span style="">mga </span>Barangay</i>
and the <i>Pampurok na Katipunan ng mga Sangguniang Bayan</i>, the people have
expressed their desire not only to abolish the <i>interim</i> National
Assembly, but to replace it with a more representative body acceptable to them
in order to effect the desirable constitutional changes necessary to hasten the
political evolution of the govern­ment towards the parliamentary system, while
at the same time ensuring that the gains of the New Society, which are vital to
the welfare of the people, shall be safeguarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be doubted, therefore, that these
proposed changes were initiated by the people themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be futile to insist that the <i>interim</i> National
Assembly should have been convened to propose those amendments pursuant to
Section 15 of Article XVII of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court, in the case of <i>Aquino v. </i><i><span style="">Commission on </span>Elections</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
took judicial notice of the fact that in the referendum of January, 1973, a
majority of those who approved the new Constitution voted on the condition that
the <i>interim</i> National Assembly provided in the Transitory Provisions <i>should</i><i><span style=""> not be </span>convened</i>, and the
President "in deference to the sovereign will of the Filipino people"
declared that the convening of said body shall be suspended.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court observed in the <i>Aquino</i> case:</p>

<blockquote>"His decision to defer the initial convocation of the <i>interim</i>
National Assembly was supported by the sovereign people at the referendum in
January, 1973 when the people voted to postpone the convening of the <i>interim</i>
National Assembly until after at least seven (7) years from the approval of the
new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the reason why the
same question was eliminated from the questions to be submitted at the
referendum on February 27, 1975, is that even some members of the Congress and
delegates of the Constitutional Convention, who are already <i>ipso facto</i>
members of the <i>interim</i> National Assembly, are against such inclusion;
because the issue was already decided in the January, 1973 referendum by the
sovereign people indicating thereby their disenchantment with any Assembly as
the former Congress failed to institutionalize the reforms they demanded and
had wasted public funds through endless debates without relieving the suffering
of the general mass of citizenry." (p. 302).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The action of the President in suspending
the convening of the <i>interim</i> National Assembly has met the overwhelming
approval of the people in subsequent referenda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since it was the action by the people that gave binding force and
effect to the new Constitution, then it must he accepted as a necessary
consequence that the condition imposed by them, that the <i>interim</i>
assembly be not convened, should also he respected as a positive mandate of the
same sovereign.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Philippines, which is a unitary state, sove­reignty
resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The term "people" as <i>sovereign</i> is comprehensive in <span style="">its </span>context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people, as sovereign creator of all
political reality, is not merely the enfranchised citizens but the political
unity of the people.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It connotes, therefore, a people which exists not only in the urgent present
but in the continuum of history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
assumption that the opinion of The People as voters can be treated as the
expression of the interests of <i>The </i><i><span style="">People </span></i>as a historic community was, to the distinguished
American journalist and public philosopher, Walter Lippmann, unwarranted.</p>

<blockquote>"'Because of the discrepancy between The People as Voters and <i>The</i>
<i>People</i> as the corporate nation, the voters have no title to consider
themselves the proprietors of the commonwealth and to claim that their
interests are identical to the public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A prevailing plurality of the voters are not The People.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim that they are is a bogus title
invoked to justify the usurpation of the executive power by representative
assemblies and the intimidation of public men by demagogic politicians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact demagoguery can be described as the
sleight of hand by which a faction of The People as voters are invested with
the authority of <i>The People</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
is why so many crimes are committed in<br>
the People's name.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Gonzales v. Comelec, supra</i>, the Court clearly
emphasized that the power to propose amendments or to amend the Constitution is
part of the <i>inherent </i><i><span style="">power</span></i><span style=""> </span>of the people as the repository of
sovereignty in a republican state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
Congress may propose amendments to the Constitution, it acts pursuant to
authority granted to it by the people through the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the power to propose and the authority
to approve, therefore, inhere in the people as the bearer of the Constitution
making power.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of a functioning <i>interim</i> National Assembly
which, under the Constitution, had the authority to propose amendments, it
cannot be doubted that the people in case of necessity could directly exercise
the constituent power themselves or designate any other instrumentality to
propose such amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Law, like
Nature, abhors a vacuum (<i>natura vacuum abhorret</i>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The political character of the question is clearly manifest,
considering that in the ultimate analysis, the final arbiter of the question
whether or not the President has authority to act for the people in submitting
such proposals for ratification at the plebiscite of October 16 are the people
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly involves a
matter which is to be exercised by the people in their sovereign capacity,
hence, it is essentially political, not judicial.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the constituent power is not to be confused
with legislative power in general because the prerogative to propose amendments
is not embraced within the context of ordinary lawmaking, it must be noted that
the proposals to be submitted for ratification in the forthcoming referendum
are, in the final analysis, actually not of the President but in effect of the
people themselves, speaking through their authorized instrumentalities.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As the Chief Justice aptly stated in his concurring opinion in
this case:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"* </span>* * The
President merely formalized the said proposals in Presidential Decree No.
1033.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being conceded in all quarters
that sovereignty <i><span style="">resides in the
people</span></i><span style=""> and </span>it having
been demonstrated that their constituent power to amend the Constitution has
not been delegated by them to any instrumentality of the Government during the
present stage of the transition period of our political development, the
conclusion is ineluctable that their exertion of that residuary power cannot be
vulnerable to any constitutional challenge as being <i>ultra</i><i><span style=""> </span>vires</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, without venturing to rule on
whether or not the President is vested with constituent power as it does not
appear necessary to do so in the premises --- the proposals here challenged,
being acts of the sovereign people no less, cannot be said to be afflicted with
unconstitutionality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>A fortiori</i>,
the concomitant authority to call a plebiscite and to appro­priate funds
therefor is even less vulnerable not only because the President, in exercising
said authority, has acted as a mere <i>alter ego</i> of the people who made the
proposals, but likewise because the said authority is legislative in nature
rather than constituent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This is but a recognition that the People
of the Philippines <span style="">have </span>the
inherent, sole and exclusive right of regulating their own government, and of
altering or abolishing their Constitution whenever it may be necessary to their
safety or happiness. There appears to be no justification, under the existing
circumstances for a Court to create by implication a limitation on the
sovereign power of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has
been clearly explained in a previous case:<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"'There is nothing in the nature of the submission which
should cause the free exercise of it to be obstructed, or that could render it
dangerous to the stability of the government; because the measure derives all
its vital force from the action of the people at the ballot box, and there can
never be danger in submitting in an established form, to a free people, the
proposition whether they will change their fundamental law, The means provided
for the exercise of their sovereign right of changing their constitution should
receive such a construction as not to trammel the exercise of the right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Difficulties and embarrassments in its
exercise are in derogation of the right of free government, which is inherent
in the people; and the best security against tumult and revolution is the free
and unobstructed privilege to the people of the State to change their
constitution in the mode prescribed by the instrument. '"</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">The paramount consideration that impelled Us to arrive at the
foregoing opinion is the necessity of ensuring popular control over the
constituent power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If the people
are to control the constituent power the power to make and change the
fundamental law of the State," observed Wheeler,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
"the process of Constitutional change must not be based too heavily upon
existing agencies of government." Indeed, the basic premise of
republicanism is that the ordinary citizen, the common man, can be trusted to
determine his political destiny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, it is time that the peo­ple should be accorded the fullest opportunity
to decide the fundamental charter that shall provide for their governance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the ultimate analysis, the success of
the national endeavor shall depend on the vision, discipline and firmness of
the moral will of every Filipino.</p>

<p class="BODY">IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, We vote to dismiss the
petitions.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>C</i>.<i>J</i>.:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the challenge as formulated in the three petitions at bar
and the grounds advanced by the Solicitor General in opposition thereto, as
well as the arguments adduced by the counsels of the parties at the hearing had
on October 7 and 8, 1976, three vital issues readily project themselves as the
centers of controversy, namely:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the question of the
constitutionality of Presidential Decrees Nos. 991, 1031 and 1033 political or <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the present stage
of the transition period, and under the environmental circumstances now
obtaining, does the President possess power to propose amendments to the
Constitution as well as set up the required machinery and prescribe the
procedure for the ratification of his proposals by the people?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the submission to
the people of the proposed amendments within the time frame allowed therefore a
sufficient and proper submission?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>I<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>First Issue<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The threshold question is not at all one of first
impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically on the matter
of proposals to amend the Constitution, this Court, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mabanag</u></span><u>
vs. Lopez Vito</u> (78 Phil. 1), inceptively announced the dictum that -</p>

<blockquote>"Proposal to amend the Constitution is a highly political
function performed by the Congress in its sovereign legislative capacity and
committed to its charge by the Constitution itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exercise of this power is even
independent of any intervention by the Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If on grounds of expediency scrupulous
attention of the judiciary be needed to safeguard public interest, there is
less reason for judicial inquiry into the validity of a proposal than into that
of <span class="GramE">a ratification</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In time, however, the validity of the
said pronouncement was eroded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
assessment of the Court itself -</p>

<blockquote>"The force of this precedent has been weakened, however, by <span class="SpellE">Suanes</span> vs. Chief Accountant of the Senate (81 Phil. 818), <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> (L-2581, March
4 and 14, 1949), <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
(L-10520, February 28, 1957), and Macias vs. Commission on Elections (L-18684,
September 14, 1961).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In short, the issue whether or not a Resolution of Congress -
acting as a constituent assembly - violates the Constitution is essentially <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, not political, and, hence, subject to judicial
review, and, to the extent that this view may be inconsistent with the stand
taken in <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> vs. Lopez Vito (<u>supra</u>), the
latter should be deemed modified accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Members of the Court are unanimous on this point." <span class="GramE">(Gonzales vs. Commission on Elections, et al., L-28196, November 9,
1967, 21 SCRA 774, 786-787).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The abandonment of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Mabanag</u></span><u> vs. Lopez Vito</u> doctrine appears to
have been completed when, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Javellana</u></span><u> vs.
Executive Secretary, et al</u>. (L-36142, March 31, 1973, 50 SCRA 30), six
members of the Court concurred in the view that the question of whether the
1973 Constitution was ratified in accordance with the provisions of Article XV
(Amendments) of the 1935 Constitution is inherently and essentially <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As elucidated therein, with extensive quotations from <span class="SpellE"><u>Tañada</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span></u>
(103 Phil. 1051) -</p>

<blockquote>"'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> the term 'political
question' connotes, in legal parlance, what it means in ordinary parlance,
namely, a question of policy in matters concerning the government of a State,
as body politic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in the
language of <u>Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Secundum</span></span></u><span class="GramE"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span><u>supra</u>), it refers to 'those
questions which, under the Constitution, are to be <u>decided</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u>
<u>people</u> in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which <u>full</u> <u>discretionary</u>
<u>authority</u> has been delegated to the Legislature or executive branch of
the government.' It is concerned with issues dependent upon the <u>wisdom</u>, <u>not</u>
<u>legality</u>, of a particular measure.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, when the grant of power is qualified,
conditional or subject to limitations, the issue on whether or not the prescribed
qualifications or conditions have been met, or the limitations respected, is <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> or non-political, the crux of the problem being
one of <u>legality</u> or <u>validity</u> of the contested act, <u>not</u> its
wisdom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, said qualifications,
conditions or limitations - particularly those prescribed or imposed by the
Constitution - would be set at naught." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> vs. Executive Secretary, <u>supra</u>).</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">So it is in the situation here presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic issue is the constitutional
validity of the presidential acts of proposing amendments to the Constitution
and of calling a referendum-plebiscite for the ratification of the proposals
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the question does not
concern itself with the <u>wisdom</u> of the exercise of the authority claimed
or of the specific amendments proposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, the inquiry <span class="SpellE"><u>vel</u></span> <u>non</u> is
focused solely on the existence of the said power in the President - a question
purely of legality determinable thru interpretation and construction of the
letter and spirit of the Constitution by the Court as the final arbiter in the
delineation of constitutional boundaries and the allocation of constitu­tional
powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the Court to shun cognizance of the challenge herein
presented, especially in these parlous years, would be to abdicate its
constitutional powers, shirk its constitutional responsibility, and deny the
people their ultimate recourse for judicial determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">I have thus no hesitancy in concluding that the question here
presented is well within the periphery of judicial inquiry.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>II<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>Second Issue<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The main question stands on a different footing; it appears
unprecedented both here and elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its solution, I believe, can be found and unraveled only by a critical
assessment of the existing legal order in the light of the prevailing political
and factual milieu.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, there is an impressive array of consistent
jurisprudence on the proposition that, normally or under normal conditions, a
Constitution may be amended only in accord with the procedure set forth
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, if there be any such
prescription for the amendatory process - as invariably there is because one of
the essential parts of a Constitution is the so-called "constitution of
sovereignty" which comprises the<span style=""> </span>provision
or provisions on the modes in accordance with which formal changes in the
fundamental law may be effected - the same would ordinarily be the controlling
criterion for the validity of the amendments sought.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, however, <u>during the present transition period
of our political development</u>, no express provision is extant in the
Constitution regarding the agency or agent by whom and the procedure by which
amendments thereto may be proposed and ratified - a fact overlooked by those
who challenge the validity of the presidential acts in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because there are at least <u>two
distinctly perceptible stages</u> in the transition from the old system of
government under the 1935 Constitution to the new one established by the 1973
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>first</u> <u>stage</u> comprises the period from the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Constitution on January 17, 1973 to the
time the <u>interim</u> National Assembly is convened by the incumbent
President and the <u>interim</u> President and the <u>interim</u> Prime
Minister are chosen (Article XVII, Sections 1 and 3[1]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of this stage as an obvious
fact of the nation's political life was recognized by the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span><u> vs. Commission on Elections, et al</u>.
(L-40004, January 31, 1975, 62 SCRA 275), when it rejected the claim that,
under the 1973 Constitution, the President was in duty bound to convene the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly soon after the Constitution took effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>second</u> <u>stage</u> embraces the period from the date
the <u>interim</u> National Assembly is convened to the date the Government
described in Articles VII to IX of the Constitution is inaugurated, following
the election of the members of the regular National Assembly (Article XVII,
Section 1) and the election of the regular President and Prime Minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is as it should be because it is
recognized that the President has been accorded the discretion to determine
when he shall initially convene the <u>interim</u> National Assembly, and his
decision to defer the convocation thereof has found overwhelming support by the
sovereign people in two previous referenda, thereby giving reality to an
interregnum between the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
Constitution and the initial convocation of the <u>interim</u> National
Assembly, which interregnum, as aforesaid, constitutes the first stage in the
transition period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against this factual backdrop, it is readily discernible that
neither of the two sets of provisions embodied in the Constitution on the
amendatory process applies during the said <u>first</u> <u>stage</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section 15, Article XVII (Transitory
Provisions) provides -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 15.</span> The <u>interim</u> National
Assembly, upon special call by the <u>interim</u> Prime Minister, may, by a
majority vote of all its Members, propose amendments to this Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such amendments shall take effect when
ratified in accordance with Article Sixteen hereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Patently, the reference to the "<u>interim</u>
National Assembly" and the "<u>interim</u> Prime Minister"
limits the application thereof to the <u>second</u> <u>stage</u> of the
transition period, i.e., after the <u>interim</u> National Assembly shall have
been convened and the <u>interim</u> Prime Minister shall have been chosen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the provisions of Article XVI (Amendments),
to wit -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span> (1) Any amendment to, or
revision of, this Constitution may be proposed by the National Assembly upon a
vote of three-fourths of all its Members, or by a constitutional convention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The National
Assembly may, by a vote of two-thirds of all its Members, call a constitutional
convention or, by a majority vote of all its Members, submit the question of
calling such a convention to the electorate in an election.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span> Any amendment to, or
revision of, this Constitution shall be valid when ratified by a majority of
the votes cast in a plebiscite which shall be held not later than three months
after the approval of such amendment or revision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">unequivocally</span>
contemplate amendments after the <u>regular</u> Government shall have become
fully operative, referring as they do to the National Assembly which will come
into being only at that time.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the face of this constitutional hiatus, we are confronted with
the dilemma whether amendments to the Constitution may be effected during the
aforesaid <u>first</u> <u>stage</u> and, if in the affirmative, by whom and in
what manner such amendments may be proposed and ratified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Susceptibility to change is one of the hallmarks of an ideal
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being a mere
declaration of the traditions of a nation but more the embodiment of a people's
hopes and aspirations, its strictures are not unalterable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are, instead, dynamic precepts intended
to keep in stride with and attuned to the living social organism they seek to
fashion and govern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is conceded
that "the political or philosophical aphorism of one generation is doubted
by the next and entirely discarded by the third," then a Constitution must
be able to adjust to the changing needs and demands of society so that the
latter may survive, progress and endure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On these verities, there can be no debate.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the first stage of the transition period in which the
Government is at present - which is understandably the most critical - the need
for change may be most pressing and imperative, and to disavow the existence of
the right to amend the Constitution would be sheer political heresy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such view would deny the people a mechanism
for effecting peaceful change, and belie the organic conception of the
Constitution by depriving it of its means of growth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a result obviously could not have been
intended by the framers of the fundamental law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems, however, that the happenstance that the first period
would come to pass before the convocation of the <u>interim</u> National
Assembly was not anticipated, hence, the omission of an express mandate to
govern the said situation in so far as amendments are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such omission through inadvertence should
not, because it cannot, negate the sovereign power of the people to amend the
fundamental charter that governs their lives and their future and perhaps even
determines their very survival as a nation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it is clear from the afore-quoted provisions
on the amendatory process that the intent was, instead, to provide a simpler
and more expeditious mode of amending the Constitution during the transition
period. For, while under Article XVI thereof, proposals for amendment may be
made directly by the regular National Assembly by a vote of at least
three-fourths of all its members, under Section 15 of Article XVII, a bare
majority vote of all the members of the <u>interim</u> National Assembly would
suffice for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relaxation
and the disparity in the vote requirement are revealing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They can only signify a recognition of the
need to facilitate the adoption o<span style="">f </span>amendments
during the second stage of the transition period so that the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly will be able, in a manner of speaking, to iron out the kinks
in the new Constitution, remove imperfections therein, and provide for changed
or changing circumstances before the establishment of the regular
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this context, therefore,
it is inutile speculation to assume that the Constitution was intended to
render impotent or bar the effectuation of needful change at an even more
critical period - the first stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
greater reason, therefore, must the right and power to amend the Constitution
during the first stage of the transition period be upheld, albeit within its
express and implied <span class="GramE">constraints.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be successfully argued, in the same context and in
the present posture, that the Constitution may be amended during the said first
stage only by convening the <u>interim</u> National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to say and require that the said
stage must first be brought to an end before any amendment may be proposed and
ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Settled jurisprudence does not
square with such a proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly
noted in <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span><u> vs. Commission on Elections,
et al</u>., <u>supra</u>, the framers of the Constitution set no deadline for
the convening of the <u>interim</u> National Assembly because they could not
have foreseen how long the crises which impelled the proclamation and justify
the continued state of martial law <span style="">would
</span>last.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the framers
committed to the sound judgment of the President the determination of the time
when the <u>interim</u> National Assembly should be convoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That judgment is not subject to judicial
review, save <u>possibly</u> to determine whether arbitrariness has infected
such exercise; absent such a taint, the matter is solely in the keeping of the
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To thus contend that only by
convening the <u>interim</u> National Assembly may the Constitution be amended
at this time would be to effectively override the judgment vested in the
President, even in default of any showing that in not convoking the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly he has acted arbitrarily or gravely abused his
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, to sustain such
a contention would not only negate the mandate so resoundingly expressed by the
people in two national referenda against the immediate convening of the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly, but as well deride their overwhelming approval of the manner
in which the President has exercised the legislative power to issue
proclamations, orders, decrees and instructions having the stature and force of
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the constitutional stalemate or impasse spawned by these
supervening developments, the logical query that compels itself for resolution
is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By whom, then, may proposals for the
amendment of the Constitution be made and in what manner may said proposals be
ratified by the people? <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is conventional wisdom that, conceptually, the constituent
power is not to be confused with legislative power in general because the
prerogative to propose amendments to the Constitution is not in any sense
embraced within the ambit of ordinary law-making.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is much to recommend the
proposition that, in default of an express grant thereof, the legislature -
traditionally the delegated repository thereof - may not claim it under a
general grant of legislative authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the same vein, neither would it be altogether unassailable to say
that because by constitutional tradition and express allocation the constituent
power under the Constitution is located in the law-making agency and at this
stage of the transition period the law-making authority is firmly recognized as
being lodged in the President, the said constituent power should now logically
be in the hands of the President who may thus exercise it in place of the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, as pointed
out in <u>Gonzales vs. Commission on Elections, et al</u>., <u>supra</u>, the
power to amend the Constitution or to propose amendments thereto</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> is
part of the inherent powers <u>of the people</u> - as the repository of
sovereignty in a republican state, such as ours - to make, and, hence, to amend
their own Fundamental Law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As such, it is undoubtedly a power that
only the sovereign people, either directly by themselves or through their
chosen delegate, can wield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since it has
been shown that the people, inadvertently or otherwise, have not delegated that
power to any instrumentality during the current stage of our hegira from crisis
to normalcy, it follows of necessity that the same remains with them for them
to exercise in the manner they see fit and through the agency they choose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, even if it were conceded that - as it is
reputedly the rule in some jurisdictions - a delegation of the constituent
authority amounts to a complete divestiture from the people of the power
delegated which they may not thereafter unilaterally reclaim from the delegate,
there would be no violence done to such rule, assuming it to be applicable
here, inasmuch as that power, under the environmental circumstances adverted
to, has not been delegated to anyone in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constituent power during the <u>first</u>
<u>stage</u> of the transition period belongs to and remains with the people,
and accordingly may be exercised by them - how and when - at their pleasure.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, a flashback to the recent and contemporary
political ferment in the country proves revelatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people, shocked and revolted by the
"obvious immorality" of the unabashed manner by which the delegates
to the Constitutional Convention virtually legislated themselves into office as
<u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> members of the <u>interim</u> National Assembly by the
mere fiat of voting for the transitory provisions of the Constitution and the
stark reality that the unwieldy political monstrosity that the <u>interim</u>
Assembly portended to be would have proven to be a veritable drain on the
meager financial resources of a nation struggling for survival, have
unequivocally put their foot down, as it were, on the convocation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this patently salutary decision of the
people proved to be double-edged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
likewise bound the political machinery of the Government in a virtual
straight-jacket and consigned the political evolution of the nation into a
state of suspended animation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Faced with
the ensuing dilemma, the people understandably agitated for a solution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through consultations in the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> and <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span>
assemblies, the instrumentalities through which the people's voice is
articulated in the unique system of participatory democracy in the country
today, the underpinnings for the hastening of the return to constitutional
normalcy quickly evolved into an overwhelming sentiment to amend the
Constitution in order to replace the discredited <u>interim</u> National
Assembly with what the people believe will be an appropriate agency to
eventually take over the law-making power and thus pave the way for the early
lifting of martial rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In pursuit of
this sentiment, and to translate its constraints into concrete action, the <span class="SpellE">Pambansang</span> <span class="SpellE">Katipunan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Pambansang</span> <span class="SpellE">Katipunan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Kabataang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Lupong</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagapagpaganap</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Katipunan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Sanggunian</span>,
and finally the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>,
to a man and as one voice, have come forward with definitive proposals for the
amendment of the Constitution, and, choosing the President - the only political
arm of the State at this time through which that decision could be implemented
and the end in view attained - as their spokesman, proposed the amendments
under challenge in the cases at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of this milieu and its imperatives, one thing is
inescapable:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the proposals now submitted
to the people for their ratification in the forthcoming referendum-plebiscite
are factually not of the President; they are directly those of the people
themselves speaking thru their authorized instrumentalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President merely formalized the said
proposals in Presidential Decree No. 1033.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It being conceded in all quarters that sovereignty resides in the people
and it having been demonstrated that their constituent power to amend the
Constitution has not been delegated by them to any instrumentality of the
Government during the present stage of the transition period of our political
development, the conclusion is ineluctable that their exertion of that residuary
power cannot be vulnerable to any constitutional challenge as being <u>ultra</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly - without venturing to rule on whether or not the President
is vested with constituent power, as it does not appear necessary to do so in
the premises - the proposals here challenged, being acts of the sovereign
people no less, cannot be said to be afflicted with unconstitutionality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A</u> <u>fortiori</u>, the concomitant
authority to call a plebiscite and to appropriate funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is even less vulnerable not only because the President, in exercising said
authority, has acted as a mere <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u> of the people who made
the proposals, but likewise because the said authority is legislative in nature
rather than constituent.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>III<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>Third Issue<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Little need be said of the claimed insufficiency and impropriety
of the submission of the proposed amendments for ratification from the
standpoint of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>thesis cannot be disputed that a
fair submission presupposes an adequate time lapse to enable the people to be
sufficiently enlightened on the merits or demerits of the amendments presented
for their ratification or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, circumstances there are which unmistakably demonstrate that the
<u>desideratum</u> is met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the
proposals appear to have been formalized only upon the promulgation of
Presidential Decree <span style="">No. </span>1033 on
September 22, 1976, they are actually the crystallization of sentiments that
for so long have preoccupied the minds of the people and their authorized
representatives, from the very lowest level of the political hierarchy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, unlike proposals emanating from a
legislative body, the same cannot but he said to have been mulled over,
pondered upon, debated, discussed and sufficiently understood by the great
masses of the nation long before they ripened into formal proposals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it is a fact of which judicial notice may well be taken
that in the not so distant past when the 1973 Constitution was submitted to the
people for ratification, an all-out campaign, in which all the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention reportedly participated, was launched to acquaint the
people with the ramifications and workings of the new system of government
sought to be inaugurated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may thus well be assumed that the people
in general have since acquired, in the very least, a working know­ledge of the
entirety of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
changes now proposed - the most substantial of which being merely the
replacement of the <u>interim</u> National Assembly with another legislative
arm for the Government during the transition period until the regular National
Assembly shall have been constituted - do not appear to be of such complexity
as to require considerable time to be brought home to the full understanding of
the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in fact, the massive and
wide-ranging informational and educational campaign to this end has been and
still is in full swing, with all the media, the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span>,
the civic and <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> groups - and even the
religious – all over the land in active and often enthusiastic if not frenetic
involvement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, when the people cast their votes on October 16, a
negative vote could very well mean an understanding of the proposals which they
reject; an affirmative vote could equally be indicative of such understanding and/or
an abiding credence in the fidelity with which the President has kept the trust
they have confided to him as President and administrator of martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>ACCORDINGLY, I vote for the dismissal of the three petitions
at bar.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CONCEPCION JR., <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I vote for the dismissal of the petitions.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue is not
political and therefore <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The term "political question", as this Court has previously
defined, refers to those questions which, under the constitution, are to be
decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which full
discretionary authority has been delegated to the Legislature or executive
branch of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
concerned with the issues dependent upon the wisdom, not legality, of a
particular measure.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the question raised is whether the President has authority
to propose to the people amendments to the Constitution which the petitioners
claim is vested solely upon the National Assembly, the constitutional
convention called for the purpose, and the <u>interim</u> National
Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a political
question since it involves the determination of conflicting claims of authority
under the constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, resolving the issue of whether or not a Resolution of Congress,
acting as a constituent assembly, violates the Constitution, ruled that the
question is essentially <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>, not political,
and hence, subject to judicial review.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court finally dispelled all doubts as to its position regarding its
jurisdiction <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the constitutionality of the
acts of Congress, acting as a constituent assembly, as well as those of a
constitutional convention called for the purpose of proposing amendments to the
constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as observance of
constitutional provisions on the procedure for amending the constitution is
concerned, the issue is cognizable by this Court under its powers of judicial
review.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the merits, a
brief backdrop of the decision to hold the referendum-plebiscite will help
resolve the issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted
that under the 1973 Constitution, an <u>interim</u> National Assembly was
organized to bring about an orderly transition from the presidential to the
parliamentary system of government.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The people, however, probably distrustful of the members who are old-time
politicians and constitutional delegates who had voted themselves into
membership in the <u>interim</u> National Assembly, voted against the convening
of the said <u>interim</u> assembly for at least seven years,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
thus creating a political stalemate and a consequent delay in the
transformation of the government into the parliamentary system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To resolve the impasse, the President, at the
instance of the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> and <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span>
assemblies through their duly authorized instrumentalities who recommended a
study of <span style="">the </span>feasibility of
abolishing and replacing the <u>interim</u> National Assembly with another <u>interim</u>
body truly representative of the people in a reformed society, issued
Presidential Decree No. 991, on September 2, 1976, calling for a national referendum
on October 16, 1976 to ascertain the wishes of the people as to the ways and
means that may be available to attain the objective; providing for a period of
educational and information campaign on the issues; and establishing the <span style="">mechanics and manner for holding
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the people, through their <span class="SpellE">barangays</span>, addressed resolutions to the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>, expressing their desire to have the constitution
amended, thus prompting the President to issue Presidential Decree No. 1033,
stating the questions to be submitted to the people in the
referendum-plebiscite on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="10"><span style="">October 16, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As will be seen, the
authority to amend the Constitution was removed from the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly and transferred to the seat of sovereignty itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the Constitution emanates from the
people who are the repository of all political powers, their authority to amend
the Constitution through the means they have adopted, aside from those mentioned
in the Constitution, cannot be gainsaid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not much reflection is also needed to show that the President did not
exercise his martial law legislative powers when he proposed the amendments to
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was merely acting
as an instrument to carry out the will of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither could he convene the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly, as suggested by the petitioners, without doing violence to
the people's will expressed overwhelmingly when they decided against con­vening
the <u>interim</u> assembly for at least seven years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The period granted to
the people to consider the proposed amendments is reasonably long and enough to
afford intelligent discussion of the issues to be voted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PD 991 has required the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span>
to hold assemblies or meetings to discuss and debate on the referendum
questions, which in fact they have been doing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the proposed amendments came from the representatives
of the people themselves, the people must have already formed a decision by
this time on what stand to take on the proposed amendments come the day for the
plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Constitution
itself requires the holding of a plebiscite for <span style="">the ratification of an amendment not later than three (3) months after
the approval of such amendment or revision,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but without setting a definite period within
which such plebiscite shall not be held. From this I can only conclude that the
framers of the Constitution desired that only a short period shall elapse from
the approval of such amendment or resolution to its ratification by the people.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

manifest to the same degree the delicate and awesome character of the function
of judicial review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While previous
rulings supply guidance and enlightenment, care is to be taken to avoid
doctrinaire rigidity un­mindful of altered circumstances and the urgencies of
the times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is inappropriate to
resolve the complex problems of a critical period without full awareness of the
consequences that flow from whatever decision is reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jural</span> norms must be
read in the context of social facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is need therefore of adjusting inherited principles to new
needs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For law, much more so
constitutional law, is simultaneously a reflection of and a force in the
society that it controls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No quality
then can be more desirable in constitutional adjudication than that
intellectual and imaginative insight which goes into the heart of the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judiciary must survey things
as they are in the light of what they must become.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must inquire into the specific problem
posed not only in terms of the teaching of the past but also of the emerging
political and legal theory, especially so under a leadership notable for its
innovative approach to social problems and the vigor of its
implementation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, on the one
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must equally be borne in mind
though that this Court must ever be conscious of the risk inherent in its being
considered as a mere subservient instrument of government policy, however
admittedly salutary or desirable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is still the need to demonstrate that the conclusion reached by it in cases
appropriate for its deter­mination has support in the law that must be
applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind that was the norm
followed, the conclusion reached being that the three petitions be

reading of past decisions, both Philippine and American, and more specifically
my concurring opinion in <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> v. Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, I must dissent from the proposition set forth in
the able and scholarly opinion of Justice Martin that there is concentration of
power in the President during a crisis government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, I cannot see my way clear to

leaves me no choice.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be stated at the outset that with the sufficiency of
doctrines supplied by our past decisions to point the way to what I did
consider the appropriate response to the basic issue raised in the <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and the other habeas corpus petitions resolved
jointly, it was only in the latter portion of my opinion that reference was
made to United States Supreme Court pronouncements on martial law, at the most
persuasive in character and rather few in number "due no doubt to the
absence in the American Constitution of any provision concerning it."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It was understandable then that it was only after the landmark Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> Milligan case, that commentators like Cooley in 1868
and Watson in 1910 paid attention, minimal at that, to the subject.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

published in this century especially after the leading cases of <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city>
v. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city>

by the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such declaration of
martial law does not suspend the civil law, though it may interfere with the
exercise of ones ordinary rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
right to call out the military forces to maintain order and enforce the law is
simply part of the police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
only justified when it reasonably appears necessary, and only justifies such
acts as reasonably appear necessary to meet the exigency, including the arrest,
or in extreme cases the killing of those who create the disorder or oppose the
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the exigency is over
the members of the military forces are criminally and civilly liable for acts
done beyond the scope of reasonable necessity.<span style="">&nbsp;

citizens that the military powers have been called upon by the executive to

lasts, they must, upon pain of arrest and punishment not commit any acts which
will in any way render more difficult the restoration of order and the

aid to the execution of civil law.<span style="">&nbsp;

executive has called upon the military power to assist him in the maintenance

<p class="BODY">The conclusion reached by me as to the state of American federal
law on the question of martial law was expressed thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is readily evident that even when
Milligan supplied the only authoritative doctrine, Burdick and <st1:city><st1:place>Willoughby</st1:place></st1:city>
did not ignore the primacy of civil liberties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Willis wrote after <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would indeed be surprising if his opinion
were otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city>,
such an approach becomes even more strongly fortified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Schwartz, whose treatise is the latest to be
published, has this summary of what he considers the present state of American
law:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The <u>Milligan</u> and <u>Duncan</u>
cases show plainly that martial law is the public law of necessity.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Necessity alone calls it forth; necessity
justifies its exercise; and necessity measures the extent and degree to which
it may be employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, the high
Court has affirmed, an unbending rule of law that the exercise of military
power, where the rights of the citizen are concerned, may never be pushed
beyond what the exigency requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
martial law rule survives the necessity on which alone it rests, for even a
single minute, it becomes a mere exercise of lawless violence.’ Further:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<u>Sterling v. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span></u>
is of basic importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before it, a
number of decisions, including one by the highest Court, went on the theory
that the executive had a free hand in taking martial-law measures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under them, it has been widely supposed that
a martial-law proclamation was so far conclusive that any action taken under it
was immune from judicial scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Sterling
v. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span></u> definitely discredits these earlier
decisions and the doctrine of conclusiveness derived from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under <u>Sterling v. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span></u>,
where martial law measures impinge upon personal or property rights-normally
beyond the scope of military power, whose intervention is lawful only because
an abnormal situation has made it necessary—the executives <u>ipse</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>dixit</u></span> is not of itself conclusive of the necessity.
"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was likewise an effort on my part to show what for me is
the legal effect of martial law being expressly provided for in the
Constitution rather than being solely predicated on the common law power based
on the urgent need for it because of compelling circumstances incident to the
state of actual clash of arms:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It
is not to be lost sight of that the basis for the declaration of martial law in
the Philippines is not mere necessity but an explicit constitutional
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Milligan,
which furnished the foundation for <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city> had its roots in the
English common law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is pertinence
therefore in ascertaining its significance under that system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the noted English author,
Dicey:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'"Martial law," in the
proper sense of that term, in which it means the suspension of ordinary law and
the temporary government of a country or parts of it by military tribunals, is
unknown to the law of England.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
nothing equivalent to what is called in <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
the "Declaration of the State of <st1:state><st1:place>Siege</st1:place></st1:state>,"
under which the authority ordinarily vested in the civil power for the maintenance
of order and police passes entirely to the army (<span class="SpellE"><u>autorite</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>militaire</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is an unmistakable proof of the permanent supremacy of the law
under our constitution.' There was this qualification:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Martial law is sometimes employed as a name
for the common law right of the Crown and its servants to repel force by force
in the case of invasion, insurrection, riot, or generally of any violent
resistance to the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right, or
power, is essential to the very existence of orderly government, and is most
assuredly recognized in the most ample manner by the law of <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a power which has in itself no special
connection with the existence of an armed force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Crown has the right to put down breaches
of the peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every subject, whether a
civilian or a soldier, whether what is called a ''servant of the
government," such for example as a policeman, or a person in no way
connected with the administration, not only has the right, but is, as a matter
of legal duty, bound to assist in putting down breaches of the peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt policemen or soldiers are the
persons who, as being specially employed in the maintenance of order, are most
generally called upon to suppress a riot, but it is clear that all loyal subjects
are bound to take their part in the suppression of riots.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Commitment to such an approach results in my inability to
subscribe to the belief that martial law in terms of what is provided both in
the 1935 and the present Constitutions, affords sufficient justification for
the concentration of powers in the Executive during periods of crisis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The better view, considering the juristic
theory on which our fundamental law rests is that expressed by Justice Black in
<st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city> v. <span class="SpellE">Kahanamoku</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Legislatures and courts are not merely
cherished American institutions; they are indispensable to our
government."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
If there has been no observance of such a cardinal concept at present, it is
due to the fact that before the former Congress could meet in regular session
anew, the present Constitution was adopted, abolishing it and providing for an
interim National Assembly, which has not been convened.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
So I did view the matter.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did I ignore <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span> in my <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> v. Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reference was made to the first chapter on his work on Constitutional
Dictatorship where he spoke of martial rule as "a device designed for use
in the crisis of invasion or rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may be most precisely defined as an extension of military government
to the civilian population, the substitution of the will of a military
commander for the will of the people's elected government."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Since, for me at least, the <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span> characterization
of martial law has in it more of the common law connotation, less than duly
mindful of the <span class="SpellE">jural</span> effects of its inclusion in the
Constitution itself as a legitimate device for coping with emergency conditions
in times of grave danger, but always subject to attendant limitations in
accordance with the fundamental postulate of a charters supremacy, I felt
justified in concluding:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Happily
for the Philippines, the declaration of martial law lends itself to the
interpretation that the Burdick, Willoughby, Willis, Schwartz formulations
paying due regard to the primacy of liberty possess relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said that the martial rule concept
of <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span>, latitudinarian in scope, has been
adopted, even on the assumption that it can be reconciled with our
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is undeniable is that
President Marcos has repeatedly maintained that Proclamation No. 1081 was
precisely based on the Constitution and that the validity of acts taken <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> could be passed upon by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For me, that is quite reassuring, persuaded
as I am likewise that the view of <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span> is opposed
to the fundamental concept of our polity, which puts a premium on
freedom."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Candor and accuracy
compel the admission that such a conclusion has to be qualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the opinion of the Court in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> v. Commission
on Elections, penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, the
proposition was expressly affirmed "that as Commander-in-Chief and
enforcer or administrator of martial law, the incumbent President of the
Philippines can promulgate proclamations, orders and decrees during the period
of Martial Law essential to the security and preservation of the Republic, to
the defense of the political and social liberties of the people and to the
institution of reforms to prevent the resurgence of rebellion or insurrection
or secession or the threat thereof as well as to meet the impact of a worldwide
recession, inflation or economic crisis which presently threatens all nations
including highly developed countries."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
To that extent, <span class="SpellE">Rossiter's</span> view, mainly relied upon,
now possesses juristic significance in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What, for me at least, gives cause for
concern is that with the opinion of the Court this intrusion of what I would
consider an alien element in <span style="">the </span>limited
concept of martial law as set forth in the Constitution would be allowed
further incursion into the <u>corpus</u> of the law, with the invocation of the
view expressed in the last chapter of his work, approving the
"concentration of governmental power in a democracy [as] a corrective to
the crisis inefficiencies inherent in the doctrine of the separation of
powers."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to the credit of the late Professor <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span> as
an objective scholar that in the very same last chapter, just three pages
later, he touched explicitly on the undesirable aspect of a constitutional
dictatorship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Constitutional Dictatorship is a
dangerous thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A declaration of
martial law or the passage of an enabling act is a step which must always be
feared and sometimes bitterly resisted, for it is at once an admission of the
incapacity of democratic institutions to defend the order within which they
function and a too conscious employment of powers and methods long ago outlawed
as destructive of constitutional government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Executive legislation, state control of popular liberties, military
courts, and arbitrary executive action were governmental features attacked by
the men who fought for freedom not because they were inefficient or
unsuccessful, but because they were dangerous and oppressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The re­institution of any of these features
is a perilous matter, a step to be taken only when the dangers to a <st1:state><st1:place>free
  state</st1:place></st1:state> will be greater if the dictatorial institution
is not adopted."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is by virtue of

concept of concentration of governmental power in the Executive during periods
of crisis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to lose sight of
the undeniable fact that in this country through the zeal, vigor, and energy

much has been done in so brief a time.<span style="">&nbsp;

vigorous and extensive implementation of agrarian reform."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Further, she said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A dynamic
economy has replaced a stagnant order, and its rewards are distributed among
the many, not hoarded by a few.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
foreign policy, once confined by fear and suspicion to a narrow alley of
self-imposed isolation, now travels the broad expressways of friendship and
constructive interaction with the whole world, these in a new spirit of
confidence and self-reliance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
finally, forced to work out our own salvation, the Filipino has re-discovered
the well-springs of his strength and resiliency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Filipinos, we have found our true
identity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And having broken our crisis
of identity, we are no longer apologetic and afraid."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
The very idea of a crisis, however, signifies a transitory, certainly not a
permanent, state of things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>President
Marcos accordingly has not been hesitant in giving utterance to his conviction
that full implementation of the modified parliamentary system under the present
Constitution should not be further delayed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The full restoration of civilian rule can thus be expected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is more in accord with the imperatives
of a constitutional order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not
go unnoticed either that the President has referred to the present regime as
one of "constitutional authoritarianism." That has a less
objectionable ring, authority being more identified with the idea of law, as
based on right, the very antithesis of naked force, which to the popular mind
is associated with dictatorship, even if referred to as "constitutional."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For me likewise, that equally eminent scholar Corwin, also
invoked in the opinion of the Court, while no doubt a partisan of a strong
Presidency, was not averse to constitutional restraints even during periods of
crisis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I would interpret this
excerpt from the fourth edition of his classic treatise on the Presidency:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A regime of martial law may be
compendiously, if not altogether accurately, defined as one in which the
ordinary law, as administered by the ordinary courts, is superseded for the
time being by the will of a military commander.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that, when martial law is instituted under national
authority, it rests ultimately on the will of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> in his capacity as
Commander-in-Chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be added
at once, nevertheless, that the subject is one in which the record of actual
practice fails often to support the niceties of theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the employment of the military arm in
the enforcement of the civil law does not invariably, or even usually, involve
martial law in the strict sense, for, as was noted in the preceding section,
soldiers are often placed simply at the disposal and direction of the civil
authorities as a kind of supplementary police, or <u>posse</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>comitatus</u></span>; on the other hand, by reason of the
discretion that the civil authorities themselves are apt to vest in the
military in any emergency requiring its assistance, the line between such an
employment of the military and a regime of martial law is frequently any but a
hard and fast one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And partly because of
these ambiguities the conception itself of martial law today bifurcates into
two conceptions, one of which shades off into <u>military</u> <u>government</u>
and the other into the situation just described, in which the civil authority
remains theoretically in control although dependent on military aid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, there is the situation that obtained
throughout the North during the Civil War, when the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus was suspended as to certain classes of suspects, although other
characteristics of martial law were generally absent."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is by virtue of the above considerations that, with due
respect to the opinion of my brethren, I cannot yield assent to the <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span> view of concentration of governmental powers in
the Executive during martial law.</p>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is necessity
then, for me at least, that the specific question raised in all three petitions
be squarely faced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to the credit
of the opinion of the Court that it did so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basic issue posed concerns the boundaries of the power of the
President during this period of martial law, more precisely whether it covers
proposing amendments to the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is the further qualification if the stand of respondents be taken
into account that the <u>interim</u> National Assembly has not been convened
and is not likely to be called into session in deference to the wishes of the
people as expressed in three previous referenda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the ruling of the majority that the answer
be in the affirmative, such authority being well within the area of
presidential competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again I find
myself unable to join readily in that conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does seem to me that the metes and bounds
of the executive domain, while still recognizable, do appear blurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to assert that there is
absolutely no basis for such a conclusion, sustained as it is by a liberal
construction of the principle that underlies <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
v. Commission on Elections as to the validity of the exercise of the
legislative prerogative by the President as long as the <u>interim</u> National
Assembly is not convened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For me, the
stage of certitude has not been reached.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I cannot simply ignore the vigorous plea of petitioners that there is a
constitutional deficiency consisting in the absence of any constituent power on
the part of the President, the express provision of the Constitution conferring
it on the <u>interim</u> National Assembly.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>

failed to erase the grave doubts in my mind that the <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
doctrine as to the possession of legislative competence by the President during
this period of transition with the <u>interim</u> lawmaking body not called
into session be thus expanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
majority of my brethren took that step.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am not prepared to go that far.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I will explain why.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The way, for me, is beset with obstacles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, such an approach would
lose sight of the distinction between matters legislative and constituent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is implicit in the treatise on the 1935
Constitution by Justices Malcolm and Laurel.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
In their casebook<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
published the same year, one of the four decisions on the subject of
constitutional amendments is Effingham v. Dye<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
which categorically distinguished between constituent and legislative
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dean <span class="SpellE">Sinco</span>,
a well-known authority on the subject, was quite explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"If there had been no express provision in the Constitution
granting Congress the power to propose amendments, it would be outside its
authority to assume that power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress
may not claim it under the general grant of legislative power for such grant
does not carry with it the right 'to erect the state, institute the form of its
government,’ which is considered a function inherent in the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congressional law-making authority is limited
to the power of approving the laws 'of civil conduct relating to the details
and particulars of the government instituted,’ the government established by
the people."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
If that distinction be preserved, then for me the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> decision does not reach the heart of the
matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is this all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
main opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> as well as that of
the then Justice, now Chief Justice, Castro, support for the ruling that the
President cannot be deemed bereft of legislative power during this transition
stage is supplied by implications from explicit constitutional provisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
That is not the case with the power to propose amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is solely the <u>interim</u> National
Assembly that is mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the
barrier that for me is well-nigh insurmountable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I limit myself to entertaining doubts
rather than registering a dissent on this point, it is solely because of the
consideration, possessed of weight and significance, that there may be indeed
in this far-from-quiescent and static period a need for amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not feel confident therefore that a
negative vote on my part would be warranted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What would justify the step taken by the President, even if no complete
acceptance be accorded the view that he was a mere conduit of the <span class="SpellE"><u>barangays</u></span> on this matter, is that, as noted in both
qualified concurrences by Justices <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma in <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, as far as
the legislative and appropriation powers are concerned, unless such authority
be recognized, there may be <span class="SpellE">paralyzation</span> of
governmental activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While not
squarely applicable, such an approach has, to my mind, a persuasive quality as
far as the power to propose amendments is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus I would confine myself to the expression of serious doubts
on the question rather than a dissent.</p>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The constitutional
issue posed as thus viewed leaves me free to concur in the result that the
petitions be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to
accord respect to the principle that judicial review goes no further than to
checking clear infractions of the fundamental law, except in the field of human
rights where a much greater vigilance is required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to make of the Constitution a pathway
to rather than a barrier against a desirable objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown by my concurring and dissenting
opinion in <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. Commission on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>a pre-martial law decision, the funda­mental
postulate that sovereignty resides in the people<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
exerts a compelling force requiring the judiciary to refrain as much as
possible from denying the people the opportunity to make known their wishes on
matters of the utmost import for the life of the nation, Constitutional
amendments fall in that category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
fortified in that conviction by the teaching of persuasive American decisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is reinforcement to such a conclusion from retired Chief
Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion's</span> concurring and dissenting
opinion in <span class="SpellE">Aytona</span> v. Castillo,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
which I consider applicable to the present situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are his words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is well settled that the granting of
writs of prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> is ordinarily within the sound
discretion of the courts, to be exercised on equitable principles, and that
said writs should be issued when the right to the relief is clear * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
As he noted in his <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span> in the later case
of Gonzales v. <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
an action for prohibition, while petitioner was sustained in his stand, no
injunction was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was evident
in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion where judgment was
rendered "declaring that respondent Executive Secretary had and has no
power to authorize the importation in question; that he exceeded his
jurisdiction in granting said authority; that said importation is not
sanctioned by law and is contrary to its provisions; and that, for lack of the
requisite majority, the injunction prayed for must be and is, accordingly,
denied."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
With the illumination thus supplied, it does not necessarily follow that even a
dissent on my part would necessarily compel that I vote for the relief prayed
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly this is not to belittle
in any way the action taken by petitioners in filing these suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, for me, is commendable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It attests to their belief in the rule of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if their contention as to lack
of presidential power be accepted in their entirety, however, there is still
discretion that may be exercised on the matter, prohibition being an equitable
remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, for me, potent
considerations that argue against acceding to the plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the prospect of the <u>interim</u> National
Assembly being convened being dim, if not non-existent, if only because of the
results in three previous referenda, there would be no constitutional agency
other than the Executive who could propose amendments which, as noted, may
urgently press for adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of even
greater weight, to my mind, is the pronouncement by the President that this
plebiscite is intended not only to solve a constitutional anomaly with the
country devoid of a legislative body but also to provide the machinery by which
the termination of martial law could be hastened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a consummation devoutly to be
wished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That does militate strongly
against the stand of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
obstruction they would pose may be fraught with pernicious consequences.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to refer anew to what I deem the cardinal
character of the <span class="SpellE">jural</span> postulate explicitly affirmed
in both the 1935 and the present Constitutions that sovereignty resides in the
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I made clear in <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. Commission on Elections and thereafter in my dissent
in <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> v. The Executive Secretary<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>

The destiny of the country lies in their keeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The role of leadership is not to be

encourage their participation in the power process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to make the regime truly

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is reassurance
in the thought that this Court has affirmed its commitment to the principle
that the amending process gives rise to a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
rather than a political question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it
has been since the leading case of Gonzales v. Commission on Elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
It has since then been followed in <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. Commission
on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> v.

This Court did not heed the vigorous plea of the Solicitor General to resurrect

This is not to deny that the federal rule in the United States as set forth in
the leading case of Coleman v. Miller,<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1939 decision, and relatively recent State court decisions, supply ammunition
to such a contention.<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
That may be the case in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but certainly not in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Philippine constitutional tradition is to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can trace its origin to these words in the
valedictory address before the 1934-35 Constitutional Convention by the
illustrious <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M. Recto:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is one of the paradoxes of democracy
that the people at times place more confidence in instrumentalities of the
State other than those directly chosen by them for the exercise of their
sovereignty."<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
It can be said with truth, therefore, that there has invariably been a judicial
predisposition to activism rather than self-restraint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thinking all these years has been that it
goes to the heart of constitutionalism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may be said that this Court has shunned the role of a mere interpreter; it did
exercise at times creative power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
to that extent participated in the molding of policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has always recognized that in the large
and undefined field of constitutional law, adjudication partakes of the quality
of statecraft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assumption has been
that just because it cannot by itself guarantee the formation, much less the
perpetuation of democratic values or, realistically, it cannot prevail against
the pressure of political forces if they are bent in other directions, it does
not follow that it should not contribute its thinking to the extent that it
can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been asked, it will continue
to be asked, to decide momentous questions at each critical stage of this
nation's life.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There must be, however, this <u>caveat</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial activism gives rise to difficulties
in <span style="">an </span>era of transformation and
change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A society in flux calls for
dynamism in the law, which must be responsive to the social forces at
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot remain static.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be sensitive to life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court then must avoid the rigidity of
legal ideas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must resist the
temptation of wallowing in the wasteland of meaningless abstractions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must face stubborn reality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has to have a feel for the complexities of
the times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to discount the
risk that it may be swept too far and too fast in the surge of novel
concepts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The past too is entitled to a
hearing; it cannot just be summarily ignored.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>History still has its uses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not for this Court to renounce the virtue of systematic <span class="SpellE">jural</span>
consistency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot simply yield to
the sovereign sway of the accomplished fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be deaf to the dissonant dialectic of what appears to be a
splintered society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should strive to <span style="">be a </span>factor for unity under a rule of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be, on its part,
awareness of the truth that a new juridical age born before its appointed time
may be the cause of unprecedented travail that may not end at birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is by virtue of such considerations that I
did strive for a confluence of principle and practicality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must confess that I did approach the matter
with some misgivings and certainly without any illusion of omniscience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am comforted by the thought that
immortality does not inhere in judicial opinions.</p>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am thus led by my
studies on the subject of constitutional law and, much more so, by previous
judicial opinions to concur in the dismissal of the petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I gave expression to views not currently
fashionable, it is solely due to deeply-ingrained beliefs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, I am <span style="">the </span>first to recognize the worth of the social and economic
reforms so needed by the troubled present that have been introduced and
implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no thought then of
minimizing, much less of refusing to concede, the considerable progress that
has been made and the benefits that have been achieved under this
Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, to reiterate one
of my cherished convictions, I certainly approve of the adherence to the
fundamental principle of popular sovereignty, which, to be meaningful, however,
requires both freedom in its manifestation and accuracy in ascertaining what it
wills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, it is fitting and
proper that a distinction was made between two aspects of the coming poll, the
referendum and the plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
only the latter that is impressed with authoritative force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the Constitution requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, there should be, as I did mention in
my concurrence in <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> v. Commission on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
full respect for free speech and press, free assembly and free
association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be no thought
of branding the opposition as the enemy and the expression of its views as
anathema.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dissent, it is fortunate to
note, has been encouraged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not
been identified with disloyalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
ought to be the case, and not solely due to presidential decrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constructive criticism is to be welcomed not
so much because of the right to be heard but because there may be something
worth hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to ensure a true
ferment of ideas, an interplay of knowledgeable minds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, though, well-defined limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One may not advocate disorder in the name of
protest, much less preach rebellion under the cloak of dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I mean to stress is that except on a
showing of clear and present danger, there must be respect for the traditional
liberties that make a society truly free.</blockquote>

recognition that the incumbent President possesses legislative competence so
that during the period of Martial Law he could assure "the security and
preservation of the Republic, * * * the defense of the political and social
liberties of the people and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * the
institution of reforms to prevent the resurgence of rebellion or insurrection
or secession or the threat there­of as well as to meet the impact of a

Palma and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> concurred, although in a separate
opinion, Justice <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma qualified it by saying
that the grant of legislative power "is necessarily to fill up a vacuum
during the transition period when the interim National Assembly is not yet
convened and functioning, for otherwise, there will be a disruption of official
functions resulting in a collapse of the government and of the existing social
order." (At 347) There was likewise a concurring opinion by the then
Justice, now Chief Justice, Castro that such competence is derived from
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Sec. 3 of the Transitory Provisions of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
and Justices <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>

would confine "his legislative and appropriation powers under martial law
to the law of necessity of preservation of the state which gave rise to its
proclamation (including appropriations for operations of the government and its
agencies and instrumentalities)." (At 316-317) The writer of this opinion

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKASIAR, <i>J</i>.:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the validity or effectivity of the proposed amendments is
to be decided ultimately by the people in their sovereign capacity, the
question is political as the term is defined in Tañada, et al. vs. Cuenco, et
al. (103 Phil. 1051), which is a bar to any judicial inquiry, for the reasons
stated in Our opinion in Javellana, et al. vs. Executive Secretary, et al.
(L-36142); Tan, et al. vs. Executive Secretary, et al. (L-36164); Roxas, et al.
vs. Executive Secretary, et al. (L-36165); Monteclaro, etc., et al. vs.
Executive Secretary, et al. (L-36236); and Dilag, et al. vs. Executive
Secretary, et al. (L-36283, March 31, 1973, 50 SCRA 30, 204-283).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The procedure for amendment is not
important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ratification by the people is
all that is indipensable to validate an amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once ratified, the method of making the
proposal and the period for submission become irrelevant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contrary view negates the very essence of a republican
democracy -- that the people are sovereign -- and renders meaningless the
emphatic declaration in the very first provision of Article II of the 1973
Constitution that the Philippines is a republican state, sovereignty resides in
the people and all government authority emanates from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic that sovereignty is
illimitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The representatives cannot
dictate to the sovereign people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
may guide them; but they cannot supplant their judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an opposite view likewise distrusts the
wisdom of the people as much as it despises their intelligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It evinces a presumptuous pretension to
intellectual superiority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
thousands upon thousands among the citizenry, who are not in the public
service, who are more learned and better skilled than many of their elected
representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, WE already ruled in Aquino, et al. vs. Comelec, et al
(L-40004, Jan. 31, 1975, 62 SCRA 275, 298-302) that the President as enforcer
or administrator of martial rule during the period of martial law can
legislate; and that he has the discretion as to when the convene the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly depending on prevailing conditions of peace and order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the fact that the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly has not been convoked in obedience to the desire of the
people clearly expressed in the 1973 referenda, the President therefore remains
the lone law-making authority while martial law subsists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he can also exercise the power
of the <u>interim</u> National Assembly to propose amendments to the New
Constitution (Sec. 15, Art. XVII).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If,
as conceded by petitioner Vicente Guzman (L-44684), former delegate to the 1971
Constitutional Convention which drafted the 1973 Constitution, the President,
during the period of martial law, can call a constitutional convention for the
purpose, admittedly a constituent power, it stands to reason that the President
can likewise legally propose amendments to the fundamental law.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">separate
dissenting opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MUÑOZ <st1:city><st1:place>PALMA</st1:place></st1:city>,
<i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur fully with the remarkably frank (so characteristic of
him) dissenting opinion of my distinguished colleague, Justice Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I am
writing this brief statement it is only to unburden myself of some thoughts
which trouble my mind and leave my conscience with no rest nor peace.</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, one who dissents from a majority view of the Court
takes a lonely and at times precarious road, the burden being lightened only by
the thought that in this grave task of administering justice, when matters of
conscience are at issue, one must be prepared to espouse and embrace a rightful
cause however unpopular it may be.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That sovereignty
resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them is a
fundamental, basic principle of government which cannot be disputed, <u>but</u>
when the people have opted to govern themselves under the mantle of a <u>written
Constitution, each and every citizen, from the highest to the lowliest, has the
sacred duty to respect and obey the Charter they have so ordained</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"By the Constitution which they establish, they not only tie
up the hands of their official agencies, but <u>their own hands as well; and
neither the officers of the state, nor the whole people as an aggregate body,
are at liberty to take action in opposition to this fundamental law.</u>"
(Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 7th Ed. p. 56, Underline Ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The afore-quoted passage from the eminent jurist and author Judge
Cooley, although based on declarations of law of more than a century ago, lays
down a principle which to my mind is one of the enduring cornerstones of the
Rule of Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a principle with
which I have been familiar as a student of law under the tutelage of revered
Professors, Dr. Vicente G. <span class="SpellE">Sinco</span> and Justice Jose P.
Laurel, and which I pray will prevail at all times to ensure the existence of a
free, stable, and civilized society.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Filipino people, wanting to ensure to themselves a demo­cratic
republican form of government, have promulgated a Constitution whereby the
power to govern themselves has been entrusted to and distributed among three
branches of government; they have also mandated in clear and unmistakable terms
the method by which provisions in their fundamental Charter may be amended or
revised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having done so, the people are
bound by these constitutional limitations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For while there is no surrender or abdication of the people's ultimate
authority to amend, revise, or adopt a new Constitution, <u>sound reason</u>
demands that they keep themselves within the procedural bounds of the existing
fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of the people
to amend or change their Constitution if and when the need arises is not to be
denied, but we assert that absent a revolutionary state or condi­tion in the
country, the change must be accomplished through the ordinary, regular and
legitimate processes provided for in the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot subscribe therefore to the view taken by the Solicitor
General that the people, being sovereign, have the authority to amend the
Constitution even in a manner different from and contrary to that expressly
provided for in that instrument, and that the amendatory process is intended
more as a limitation of a power rather than a grant of power to a particular
agency and it should not be construed as limiting the ultimate sovereign will
of the people to decide on amendments to the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a view will seriously undermine the very existence of a constitutional
government and will permit anarchy and/or mob rule to set afoot and
prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was it the Greek philosopher
Plato who warned that the rule of the mob is a prelude to the rule of the
tyrant?</p>

<p class="BODY">I would use the following excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>,
S.J., "The 1973 Philippine Constitution, Notes and Cases" as relevant
to my point:</p>

<blockquote>". . . the amendatory provisions are called a 'constitution of
sovereignty' because they define the constitutional meaning of 'sovereignty of
the people.' Popular sovereignty, as embodied in the Philippine Constitution,
is not extreme popular sovereignty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
one American writer put it:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'A constitution like the American one serves as a basic check upon
the popular will at any given time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is the distinctive function of such written document to classify certain things
as legal fundamentals; these fundamentals may not be changed except by the slow
and cumbersome process of amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
people themselves have decided, in constitutional convention assembled, to
limit themselves and future generations in the exercise of the sovereign power
which they would otherwise possess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
it is precisely such limitation that enables those subject to governmental
authority to appeal from the people drunk to the people sober, in time of excitement
and hysteria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution, in the
neat phrase of the <st1:state><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:state> court, is
the protector of the people against injury by the people.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Truly, what need is there for providing in the Constitution a
process by which the fundamental law may be amended if, after all, the people
by themselves can set the same at naught even in times of peace when civil
authority reigns supreme?</p>

<p class="BODY">To go along with the respondents' theory in this regard is to
render written Constitutions useless or mere "ropes of sand",
allowing for a government of men instead of one of laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it cannot be discounted that a situation
may arise where the people are heralded to action at a point of a gun or by the
fiery eloquence of a demagogue, and where passion overpowers reason, and mass
action overthrows legal processes.</p>

<p class="BODY">History has recorded such instances, and I can think of no better
example than that of Jesus Christ of Judea who was followed and loved by the
people while curing the sick, making the lame walk and the blind see, but
shortly was condemned by the same people turned into fanatic rabble crying out
"Crucify Him, Crucify Him" upon being incited into action by chief
priests and elders of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yes, to quote once more from Judge Cooley:</p>

<blockquote>"A good Constitution should be
beyond the reach of temporary excitement and popular caprice or passion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is needed for stability and steadiness; it
must yield to the thought of the people; not to the whim of the people, or the
thought evolved in excitement or hot blood, but the sober second though which
alone, if the government is to be safe, can be allowed efficiency. .... Changes
in government are to be feared unless the benefit is certain."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(quoted in Ellingham v. Dye, 99 N.E. 1,
15)<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Presidential Decrees
Nos. 991 and 1033 which call for a national referendum-plebiscite on October
16, 1 976 for the purpose, among other things, of amending certain provisions
of the 1973 Constitution are null and void, as they contravene the express provisions
on the amending process of the 1973 Constitution laid down in Article XVI, Section
1 (1) and Article XVII, Section 15, more particularly the latter which applies
during the present transition period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> discusses in
detail this particular matter.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I would just wish to stress the point that although at present
there is no <u>interim</u> National Assembly which may propose amendments to
the Constitution, the existence of a so-called "vacuum" or
"hiatus" does not justify a transgression of the constitutional
provisions on the manner of amending the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot cure one infirmity -- the existence
of a "vacuum" caused by the non-convening of the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly -- with another infirmity, that is, doing violence to the
Charter.</p>

<blockquote>"'All great mutations shake and disorder a state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good does not necessarily succeed evil;
another evil may succeed and a worse.'" (Am. Law Rev. 1889, p. 311.,
quoted in Ellingham v. Dye, supra, p. 15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents contend that the calling of the referendum-plebiscite
for the purpose indicated is a step necessary to restore the state of normalcy
in the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, the only
possible measure that will lead our country and people to a condition of
normalcy is the lifting or ending of the state of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I am constrained to make this statement it
is because so much stress was given during the hearings of these cases on this
particular point, leaving one with the impression that for petitioners to
contest the holding of the October 16 referendum-plebiscite is for them to
assume a position of blocking or stalling the lifting of martial law, which I
believe is unfair to the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Frankly, I cannot see the connection between the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My esteemed colleagues should pardon me therefore
if I had ventured to state that <u><span style="">the
simple solution to the present dilemma is the lifting of martial law and the
implementation of the constitutional provisions which will usher in the
parliamentary form of government ordained in the Constitution</span></u><span style=""> </span>which, as pro­claimed in Proclamation
1102, the people themselves have ratified.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the people have indeed ratified the 1973 Constitution, then
they are bound by their act and cannot escape from the pretended unfavorable
consequences thereof, <u><span style="">the only
remedy</span></u><span style=""> </span>being to set
in motion the constitutional machinery by which the supposed desired amendments
may properly be adopted and submitted to the electorate for ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">Constitutional processes are to be observed strictly, if we have
to maintain and preserve the system of government decreed under the fundamental
Charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As said by Justice Enrique
Fernando in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Mutuc</span></u></span><u><span style=""> vs. Commission on Elections</span></u><span style="">:<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>".... The concept of the Constitution as the fundamental law,
setting forth the criterion for the validity of any public act whether
proceeding from the highest official or the lowest functionary, <u>is a
postulate of our system of government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is to manifest fealty to the rule of law</u>, with priority
accorded to that which occupies the topmost rung in the legal hierarchy."
.... (36 SCRA, 228, 234, underline Ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A contrary view would lead to disastrous
consequences for, in the words of Chief Justice Cox of the Supreme Court of
Indiana in <u>Effingham v. Dye</u>, (supra, p. 7) liberty and popular
sovereignty are not meant to give rein to passion or thoughtless impulse but to
allow the exercise of power by the people for the general good <u>under
constant restraints of law</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The true question
before Us <u>is one of power</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does
the incumbent President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
possess constituent powers?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the
negative answer is explained in detail in the dissenting opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents would justify the incumbent President's exercise of
constituent powers on the theory that he is vested with legislative powers as
held by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
Jr., et al. vs. Commission on Elections, et al., L-40004, January 31,
1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish to stress that although in
my separate opinion in said case I agreed that Section 3 (2) of the Transitory
provisions grants to the incumbent President legislative powers, I qualified my
statement as follows:</p>

<blockquote>".... As to, whether or not, this unlimited <u>legislative
power</u> of the President continues to exist even <u>after</u> the
ratification of the Constitution is a matter <u>which I am not ready to concede
at the moment</u>, and which at any rate I believe is not essential in
resolving this Petition for reasons to be given later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, I hold the view that the
President is empowered to issue proclamations, orders, decrees, etc. to carry
out and implement the objectives of the proclamation of martial law be it under
the 1935 or 1973 Constitution, and for the orderly and efficient functioning of
the government, its instrumentalities, and agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This grant of legislative power is necessary
to fill up a vacuum during the transition period when the <u>interim</u>
National Assembly is not yet convened and functioning, for otherwise, there
will be a disruption of official functions resulting in a collapse of the
government and of the existing social order." (62 SCRA, pp. 275, 347)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I believe it is not disputed that legislative power is
essentially different from constituent power:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one does not encompass the other unless so specified in the Charter, and
the 1973 Constitution con­tains provisions in this regard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is well-explained in Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee's</span> Opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The state of necessity brought about by the current political situation,
invoked by the respondents, provides no source of power to propose amendments
to the existing Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Must we
"bend the Constitution to suit the law of the hour?"</u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
or cure its defects "by inflicting upon it a wound which nothing can
heal," commit one assault after the other "until all respect for the
fundamental law is lost and the powers of government are just what those in
authority please to call them?"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Or can we <u>now</u> ignore what this Court, speaking through Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, said in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>".... let those who would put aside, invoking grounds at best
controversial, any mandate of the fundamental law purportedly in order to
attain some laudable objective bear in mind that someday somehow others with
purportedly more laudable objectives may take advantage of the precedent and
continue the destruction of the Constitution, making those who laid down the
precedent of justifying deviations from the requirements of the Constitution
the victims of their own folly."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents emphatically assert that the final word is the
people's word and that ultimately it is in the hands of the people where the
final decision rests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Comment, pp. 18,
19, 22) Granting in <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">argumenti</span></u> that it is so, let it be an <u>expression of
the will of the people under a normal political situation</u> and not under the
aegis of martial rule for as I have stated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, et al., supra</u>, a referendum (and now
a plebiscite) held under a regime of martial law can be of no far reaching
significance because it is being accomplished under an atmosphere or climate of
fear as it entails a wide area of curtailment and infringement of individual
rights, such as, human liberty, property rights, rights of free expression and
assembly, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, liberty of
abode and of travel, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other issues such
as the sufficiency and proper submission of the proposed amendments for
ratification by the people are expounded in Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee's</span>
Opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish to stress indeed that it
is incorrect to state that the thrust of the proposed amendments is the
abolition of the <u>interim</u> National Assembly and its substitution with an
"interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>",
<u>for that is not all</u>. <u>Proposed amendment No. 6</u> will permit or
allow the concentration of power in one man - the Executive - Prime Minister or
President or whatever you may call him - for it gives him expressly (which the
1973 Constitution or the 1 935 Constitution does not) legislative powers even
during the existence of the appropriate legislative body, dependent solely on
the executive's <u>judgment</u> on the existence of a grave emergency or a
threat or imminence thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I must be forgiven if, not concerned with the present, I am
haunted however by what can happen in the future, when we shall all be
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, this is a matter of grave
concern which necessitates full, mature, sober deliberation of the people but
which they can do only in a climate of freedom without the restraints of
martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">I close, remembering what <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M.
Recto, President of the Constitutional Convention which drafted the 1935
Philippine Consti­tution, once said:</p>

<blockquote>".... Nor is it enough that our people possess a written
constitution in order that their government may be called constitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be deserving of this name, and to drive
away all danger of anarchy as well as of dictatorship whether by one man or a

<blockquote><st1:place>I.</st1:place><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
the merits:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dissent from the
majority's dismissal of the petitions for lack of merit and vote to grant the
petitions for the following reasons and considerations:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that
neither the 1935 Constitution nor the 1973 Constitution grants to the incumbent
President the constituent power to propose and approve amendments to the
Constitution to be submitted to the people for ratification in a plebiscite.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The 1935 Constitution expressly vests the constituent power in
Congress, by a three-fourths vote of all its members, to propose amendments or
call a constitutional convention for the purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The 1973 Constitution expressly vests the constituent power in
the regular National Assembly to propose amendments (by a three-fourths vote of
all its members) or "call a constitutional convention" (by a
two-thirds vote of all its members) or "submit the question of calling
such convention to the electorate in an election" (by a majority vote of
all its members).<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The transitory provisions of the 1973 Constitution expressly vest
the constituent power during the period of transition in the interim National
Assembly "upon special call by the <u>interim</u> Prime Minister (the
incumbent President<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>)
. . . by a majority vote of all its mem­bers (to) propose amendments".<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the Constitution provides for the organization of the
essential departments of government, defines and delimits the powers of each
and prescribes the manner of the exercise of such powers, and the constituent
power has not been granted to but has been withheld from the President or Prime
Minister, it follows that the Pre­sident's questioned decrees<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
proposing and submitting constitutional amendments directly to the people
(without the intervention of the interim National Assembly in whom the power is
expressly vested) are devoid of constitutional and legal basis.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The doctrine in the
leading case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u> is controlling in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In therein declaring null and void the acts
of the 1971 Constitutional Convention and of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
in calling a plebiscite with the general elections scheduled for Novem­ber 8,
1971 for the purpose of submitting for the people's ratification an advance
amendment reducing the voting age from 21 years to 18 years, and issuing writs
of prohibition and injunction against the hold­ing of the plebiscite, this
Court speaking through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> ruled that</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">--- The Constitutional provisions on amendments<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
"dealing with the procedure or manner of amending the fundamental law are
binding upon the Convention and the other departments of the government, (and)
are no less binding upon the people";<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">--- "As long as any amendment is formulated and submitted
under the aegis of the present Charter, any proposal for such amendment which
is not in conformity with the letter, spirit and intent of the Charter for
effecting amendments, cannot receive the sanction of this Court";<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">--- "The real issue here cannot be whether or not the
amending process delineated by the present Constitution may be disregarded in
favor of allowing the sovereign people to express their decision on the
proposed amendments, if only because it is evident that the very idea of
departing from the fundamental law is anachron­istic in the realm of
constitutionalism and repugnant to the essence of the rule of law";<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and</p>

<p class="BODY">--- Accordingly barred the plebiscite as improper and premature,
since "the provisional nature of the proposed amendment and the manner of
its submission to the people for ratification or rejection" did not
"conform with the mandate of the people themselves in such regard, as
expressed in the Constitution itself",<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
i.e. <span style="">the mandatory requirements of the
amending process as set forth in the Article on Amendments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the above
rulings of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span> to the case at bar, <u>mutatis
mutandis</u>, it is clear that where the proposed amendments are <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Constitutional mandate on the amending
process not merely for being a "partial amendment" of a "<u>temporary</u>
or <u>provisional</u> character" (as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span>)
but more so for <u>not</u> being proposed and approved by the department vested
by the Constitution with the constituent power to do so, and hence
transgressing the substantive provision that it is only the interim National
Assembly, upon special call of the interim Prime Minister, by a majority vote
of all its members that may propose the amendments, the Court must declare the
amendment proposals null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is so because
the Constitution is a "superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary
means"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
but only by the particular mode and manner prescribed therein by the
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stressed by Cooley, "by
the Constitution which they establish, (the people) not only tie up the hands
of their official agencies but their own hands as well; and neither the
officers of the State, nor the whole people as an aggregate body, are at
liberty to take action in opposition to this fundamental law".<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The vesting of the
constituent power to propose amendments in the legislative body (the regular
National Assembly or the <u>interim</u> National Assembly during the transition
period) or in a constitutional convention called for the purpose is in
accordance with universal practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"From the very necessity of the case" Cooley points out "amendments
to an existing constitution, or entire revisions of it, must be prepared and
matured by some body of representatives chosen for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obviously impossible for the whole
people to meet, prepare, and discuss the proposed alterations, and there seems
to be no feasible mode by which an expression of their will can be obtained,
except by asking it upon the single point of assent or disapproval." This
body of representatives vested with the <span class="SpellE">constitutent</span>
power "sub­mits the result of their deliberations" and "puts in
proper form the questions of amendment upon which the people are to pass"
- for ratification or rejection.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span> thus rejected the argument "that the
end sought to be achieved is to be desired" and in denying reconsideration,
in paraphrase of the late <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M. Recto, declared
that "let those who would put aside, invoking grounds at best
controversial, any mandate of the fundamental law purportedly in order to
attain some laudable objective bear in mind that someday somehow others with
purportedly more laudable objectives may take advantage of the precedent and
continue the destruction of the Constitution, making those who laid down the
precedent of justifying deviations from the require­ments of the Constitution
the victims of their own folly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This same apprehension
was echoed by now retired Justice <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> in his dissenting opinion in the Ratification
cases</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that "We will be opening the gates for
a similar disregard of the Constitution in the future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I mean is that if this Court now
declares that a new Constitution is now in force because the members of the
citizens assemblies had approved said new Constitution, although that approval
was not in accordance with the procedure and the require­ments prescribed in
the 1935 Constitution, it can happen again in some future time that some
amendments to the Constitution may be adopted, even in a manner contrary to the
existing Constitution and the law, and then said proposed amendments are
submitted to the people in any manner and what will matter is that a basis is
claimed that there was approval by the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There will not be stability in our constitutional system, and
necessarily no stability in our government."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not legally
tenable for the majority, without overruling the controlling precedent of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span> (and without mustering the required
majority vote to so overrule) to accept the proposed; amendments as valid
notwithstanding their being "not in conformity with the letter, spirit and
intent of the provision of the Charter for effecting amendments" on the
reasoning that "If the President has been legitimately discharging the
legislative functions of the interim Assembly, there is no reason why he cannot
validly discharge the function of that Assembly to propose amendments to the
Constitution, which is but adjunct, although peculiar, to its gross legislative
functions."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the earlier leading case of <u>Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>,
this Court speaking through now retired Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>, pointed out that "Indeed, the power to
amend the Constitution or to propose amendments thereto is not included in the
general grant of legislative powers to Congress"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
or to the National Assembly.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Were it not for the express grant in the Transitory Provisions of the
constituent power to the interim National Assembly, the interim Na­tional
Assembly could not claim the power under the general grant of legislative power
during the transition period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority's ruling in the Referendum cases<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
that the Transitory Provisions in section 3 (2) recognized the existence of the
authority to legislate in favor of the incumbent President during the period of
martial law manifestly cannot be stretched to encompass the constituent power
as expressly vested in the interim National Assembly in derogation of the
allotment of powers defined in the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paraphrasing Cooley on the non-delegation of legislative power as
one of the settled maxims of constitutional law,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
the constituent power has been lodged by the sovereign power of the people with
the interim National Assembly during the transition period and there it must
remain as the sole constitutional agency until the Constitution itself is
changed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As was aptly stated by Justice Jose P. Laurel in the 1936
landmark case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Angara</u></span><u> vs. Electoral
Commission</u><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>,
"(T)he Constitution sets forth in no uncertain language the restrictions
and limitations upon governmental powers and agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these restrictions and limitations are
transcended it would be inconceivable if the Constitution had not provided for
a mechanism by which to direct the course of government along constitutional
channels, for then the distribution of powers would be mere verbiage, the bill
of rights mere expressions of sentiment, and the principles of good government
mere political apothegms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the
limitations and restrictions embodied in our Constitution are real as they
should be in any living Constitution".</p>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither is the
justification of "constitutional impasse" tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sentiment of the people against the
convening of the interim National Assembly and to have no elections for
"at least seven (7) years" concededly could not amend the
Constitution insofar as the interim National Assembly is concerned (since it admittedly
came into existence "immediately" upon the proclamation of
ratification of the 1973 Constitution), much less remove the constituent power
from said interim National Assembly.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stressed in the
writer's separate opinion in the Referendum cases</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, "(W)<span class="SpellE">hile</span> it has
been advanced that the decision to defer the initial convocation of the interim
National Assembly was supported by the results of the referendum in January,
1973 when the people voted against the convening of the interim National
Assembly for at least seven years, such sentiment cannot be given any legal
force and effect in the light of the State's admission at the hearing that such
referendums are merely consultative and cannot amend the Constitution or any
provision or mandate thereof such as the Transitory Provisions which call for
the 'immediate existence' and 'initial convening' of the interim National
Assembly to 'give priority to measures for the orderly transition from the

in the setting aside of a <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution banning
the use of political taped jingles by candidates for Constitutional Convention

section does not grant to the interim National Assembly the same power granted
to the regular National Assembly of calling a constitutional convention, thus
expressing the will of the Conven­tion (and presumably of the people upon

Justice Jose P. Laurel echoed U.S. Chief Justice Marshall's "climactic

expounding" and declared the Court's "solemn and sacred"
constitutional obligation of judicial review and laid down the doctrine that the
Philippine Constitution as "a definition of the powers of government"
placed upon the judiciary the great burden of "determining the nature,
scope and extent of such powers" and stressed that "when the
judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert
any superiority over the other departments ... but only asserts the solemn and
sacred obligation entrusted to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting
claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in

we take the view that the words 'submitted to the people for their
ratification', if construed in the light of the nature of the Constitution ?
<span style="">a fundamental charter that is
legislation direct from the people, an expression of their sovereign will - is
that it can only be amended by the people expressing themselves according to
the procedure ordained by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, amendments must be fairly laid before the people for their
blessing or spurning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people are not
to be mere rubber stamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not
to vote blindly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must be afforded
ample opportunity to mull over the original provisions, compare them with the
proposed amendments, and try to reach a conclusion as the dictates of their
conscience suggest, free from the incubus of extraneous or possibly insidious
influences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe the word
'submitted' can only mean that the government, within its maximum capabilities,
should strain every effort to inform every citizen of the provisions to be
amended, and the proposed amendments and the meaning, nature and effects there­of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this, we are not to be understood as
saying that, if one citizen or 100 citizens or 1,000 citi­zens cannot be
reached, then there is no submission within the meaning of the word as intended
by the framers of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
the Constitution in effect directs is that the government, in submitting an
amendment for ratification, should put every instrumentality or agency within
its structural framework to enlighten the people, educate them with respect to
their act of ratification or re­jection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, as we have earlier stated, one thing is <u>submission</u> and
another is <u>ratification</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
must be fair submission, intelligent consent or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If with all these safeguards the people still
approve the amendment no matter how preju­dicial it is to them, then so be
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the people decree their own

study thereof in detail would lead to the conclusion that the whole context of

the Cabinet in the Constitution such as the prohibition against the holding of
more than one office in the government including government-owned or

pointed out by Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, with the President
continuing to exercise legislative powers in case of "grave emergency or a

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"THE
REFERENDUM ISSUES<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On October 16, the people may be asked to decide on two
important national issues - the creation of a new legislative body and the
lifting of martial law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the first issue, it is almost sure that the interim
National Assembly will not be convened, primarily because of its
membership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Majority of the members of
the defunct Congress, who are mandated by the Constitution to become members of
the interim National Assembly, have gained so widespread a notoriety that the
mere mention of Congress conjures the image of a den of thieves who are out to
fool the people most of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among
the three branches of government, it was the most discredited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, upon the declaration of martial law,
some people were heard to mutter that a 'regime that has finally put an end to
such congressional shenanigans could not be all that bad'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A substitute legislative body is contemplated to help the
President in promulgating laws, and perhaps minimize the issuance of
ill-drafted decrees which necessitate constant amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But care should be taken that this new
legislative body would not become a mere rubber stamp akin to those of other totalitarian
countries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be given real
powers, otherwise we will just have another nebulous creation having the form
but lacking the substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Already the
President has expressed the desire that among the powers he would like to have
with regard to the proposed legislative body is that of abolishing it in case
'there is a need to do so'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">to what would occasion such a need, only the
President himself can determine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
would afford the Chief Executive almost total power over the legislature, for
he could always offer the members thereof a carrot and a stick.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the matter of lifting martial law, the people have
expressed ambivalent attitudes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of
them, remembering the turmoil that prevailed before the declaration of martial law,
have expressed the fear that its lifting might precipitate the revival of the
abuses of the past, and provide an occasion for evil elements to resurface with
their <span style="">us</span>ual tricks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others say that it is about time martial law
was lifted, since the peace <span style="">and order
situation has already stabilized and the economy seems to have been perked up.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The regime of martial law has been with us for four years
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, martial law has initially
secured some reforms for the country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The people were quite willing to participate in the new experiment,
thrilled by the novelty of it all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the euphoria, however, the people seem to have gone back to the old ways, with
the exception that some of our freedoms were taken away, and an authoritarian
regime established.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We must bear in mind that martial law was envisioned only to
cope with an existing national crisis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not meant to be availed of for a long period of time, otherwise
it would undermine our adherence to a democratic form of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the words of the Constitution, martial law
shall only be declared in times of 'rebellion, insurrection, invasion, or
imminent danger thereof, when the pub­lic safety requires it'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since we no longer suffer from internal
disturbances of a gargantuan scale, it is about time we seriously rethink the
'necessity' of prolonging the martial law regime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we justify the continuance of martial law
by economic or other reasons other than the foregoing constitutional grounds,
then our faith in the Constitution might be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even without martial law, the incumbent Chief
Exe­cutive still holds vast powers under the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the gains of the New Society can
be secured without sacrificing the freedom of our people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the converse is true, then we might have
to conclude that the Filipinos deserve a dictatorial form of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The referendum results will show whether the
people themselves have adopted this sad conclusion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The response of the people to the foregoing issues will
affect generations yet to come, so they should mull over the pros and cons very
carefully."</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This opinion is
written in the same spirit as the President's exhortations on the first
anniversary of proclamation of the 1973 Constitution that we "let the
Constitution remain firm and stable" so that it may "guide the
people", and that we "remain steadfast on the rule <span style="">of law and the Constitution" as he
recalled his rejection of the "exercise (of) power that can be identified
merely with a revolutionary government" that makes its own law, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Whoever he may be and whatever position he may happen to have, whether in
government or outside government, it is absolutely necessary now that we look
solemnly and perceptively <span style="">into the
Constitution and try to discover for ourselves what our role is in the
successful implementation of that Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With this thought, therefore, we can agree on one thing and that
is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let all of us age, let all of us then
pass away as a pace in the development of our country, but let the Constitution
remain firm and stable and let institutions grow in strength from day to day,
from achievement to achievement, and so long as that Constitution stands,
whoever may the man in power be, whatever may his purpose be, that Constitution
will guide the people and no man, however, powerful he may be, will dare to
destroy and wreck the foundation of such a Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
