				<BR><BR><div align=""><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><p>On November 28, 1960, Lim Wun Chee and her minor children Chong Yum Ting 
alias Co Yum Ting, Co Ngor alias Chong Nor Ngor, Co Yum Fai <em>alias</em> Hong 
Yum Fax, Co Woon <em>alias</em> Chong Lai Woon, and Co Lai Lam <em>alias</em> 
Chong Lai Lam, aged 13, 7, 6, 4 and 3, respectively, applied with the Philippine 
Consulate General in Hongkong for non-immigrant passport visa to the 
Philippines, allegedly to visit their husband/father, Co Pek <em>alias</em> 
Chong Wing Fai, who has permanent residence at No. 1110 Sta. Elena, Manila, 
Philippines. In connection with this application for visa, Lim Wun Chee executed 
an affidavit stating that while in the Philippines, she and her aforenamed 
children will never apply for any change of status as temporary visitors and 
they shall stay in the Philippines for only 3 months, unless otherwise extended 
by proper authorities. (Exh. 2, respondents). Temporary visitor's visa (Cabinet 
Policy) No. 210 was issued to them after Co Pek had filed with the Commissioner 
of Immigration (in Manila) a cash bond of P30,000.00, on behalf of his wife and 
children. The latter arrived in the Philippines on <em>December</em> 16, 1960. 
</p>
<p>On February 8, 1961, Co Pek's application for naturalization was granted by 
the Court of First Instance of Manila (Sp. Proc. No. 4257.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> On April 13, 1961, the stay of Lim Wun 
Chee and her children in the Philippines was extended until February 8, 1963, on 
the strength of the so-called Cabinet Policy of February 29, 1956, authorizing 
the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and of Justice to pass upon applications for 
extensions.</p>
<p>On January 15, 1962, however, the then Secretary of Foreign Affairs, 
concurred in by the Secretary of Justice, nullified and declared without effect 
the extensions of the stay of non-immigrants under the aforesaid Cabinet policy 
of February 29, 1956. As, in view thereof, the Commissioner of Immigration 
required Lim Wun Chee and her 5 children to leave the country on or before 
September 9, 1962, Co Pek, Lim Wan Chee and their children petitioned the Court 
of First Instance of Manila (in Civil Case No. 51499) to enjoin the respondent 
Commissioner of Immigration from arresting and deporting petitioners Lim Wan 
Chee and her children, and from confiscating the cash bond of P30,000.00 filed 
in their behalf by petitioner Co Pek. A writ of preliminary injunction, as 
prayed for by petitioners, was issued by the court on September 14, 1962 to 
restrain their arrest and deportation during the pendency of the case. In the 
meantime, petitioner Co Pek was able to take the oath of allegiance as a 
Filipino citizen on April 30, 1962.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>On July 11, 1963, the court (Judge Francisco Arca, presiding) rendered a 
decision in the prohibition-case, granting the petition and declaring 
petitioned, wife and minor children of Co Pek, also citizens of the Philippines 
by reason of the latter's naturalization. The Commissioner of Immigration, 
therefore, was ordered to cancel the alien registry and immigration papers of 
Lim Wun Chee and her children, and to refund to them the cash bond of 
P30,000.00. The Solicitor General, on behalf of the Commissioner of Immigration, 
appealed.</p>
<p>The legal provision pertinent to and applicable in the present appeal is 
Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization law, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 15. <em>Effect of the naturalization of wife and children</em>.â€”Any 
woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the Philippines, 
and who might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the 
Philippines.</p>
<p>"Minor children of persons naturalized under this law who have been born in 
the Philippines shall be considered citizens thereof.</p>
<p>"A foreign-born minor child, if dwelling in the Philippines at the time of 
the naturalization of the parent, shall automatically become a Philippine 
citizen, and a foreign-born minor child, who is not in the Philippines at the 
time the parent is naturalized, shall be deemed a Philippine citizen only during 
his minority, unless he begins to reside permanently in the Philippines when 
still a minor, in which case, he will continue to be a Philippine citizen even 
after becoming of age. </p></blockquote>
<p align="center">x x x x."</p>Under this provision, for the wife of a naturalized 
Filipino to be considered to have followed the citizenship of her husband, it 
must be shown that she herself is capable of being naturalized. The phrase "who 
might herself be lawfully naturalized", used in the law, has been construed to 
mean that the said wife is not disqualified to become a Filipino citizen, 
<em>and</em> that she possesses all the qualifications for acquisition of 
Philippine citizenship<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>. Although it 
may be true that petitioner Lim Wun Chee is not disqualified to become a 
Filipino citizen, there is no proof that she also possesses all the 
qualifications for citizenship in this country. The naturalization of her 
husband did therefore, <i>ipso facto</i> make her a citizen of the Philippines.
<p></p>
<p>There is a more important point that we would like to bring about in this 
opinion. In tne affidavit executed by petitioner Lim Wun Chee before the 
Philippine Consul in Hongkong on December 6, 1960, which document was one of the 
bases for the issuance of the non-immigrant visa that enabled her and her 5 
children to come to the Philippines, she declared under oath that they were 
applying for the visa "to visit" their husband/father Co Pek, a permanent 
resident of this country, and that "while in the Philippines, we (the affiant 
and her children) shall never apply for any change of status as temporary 
visitors; and that we shall stay in the Philippines for three (3) months, unless 
otherwise extended by the proper authaities." However, after they had succeeded 
in gaining entry into the country on the foregoing allegations, these 
immigrants, as petitioners in this prohibition case admitted: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"10. That <i>to comply with the naturalization law in order that Co Pek could 
take his oath as a naturalized Filipino</i> citizen, it is required that his 
minor children Co Yum Ting, Co Ngor, Co Yum Fai, Co Woon, and Co Lai Lam 
continue their studies in a school duly recognized by the Government where 
Philippine history, government and civics are taught as part of the schools 
curriculum, x x x." (Petition; italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>By their own admission in this case, therefore, it has been established that 
the coming to the Philippines of petitioner's wife and children was intended to 
insure the granting of petitioner Co Pek's application for natural- ization and 
his admission to Philippine citizenship.<span class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> 
The conduct of all of the herein petitioners-appellees could be nothing less 
than a fraud or misrepresentation perpetrated on our government. In a similar 
case,<span class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> this method was censured by this 
Court, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x if the purpose of these appellants had been from the beginning to take 
residence until the husband Ong Tai should have become naturalized, on the 
theory that the Cabinet resolution of February 29, 1956 authorized them to do 
so, then they should have so stated in their application for entry, instead of 
solemnly representing that they would be only temporary visitors. Under the 
circumstances, their application for a temporary visitor's visa appears to be a 
fraud, perpetrated on the Immigration authorities of the Republic that denies 
the holders thereof any right to favorable treatment."</p></blockquote>
<p>In another case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x It is clear that if an alien gains admission to the Islands on the 
strength of a deliberate and voluntary representation that he will enter only 
for a limited time, and thereby secures the benefit of a temporary visa, the law 
will not allow him subsequently to go back on his representation and stay 
permanently, without first departing from the Philippines as he had promised. x 
x x. Any other ruling would as stated in our previous decision, encourage aliens 
to enter the Islands on false pretenses; every alien, so permitted to enter for 
a limited time, might then claim a right to permanent admission, however flimsy 
such claim should be, and thereby compel our government to spend time, money and 
effort in examining and verifying fchether or not every such alien really has a 
right to take up permanent residence here. In the meanwhile, the alien would be 
able to prolong his stay and evade his return to the port whence he came, 
contrary to what he promised to do when he entered. The dangers inherent in such 
a ruling are self-evident."</p></blockquote>
<p>Referring again to Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization law quoted above, 
it is noteworthy that a foreign-born minor child automatically becomes a 
Philippine citizen, <i>if</i> said child is "dwelling in the Philippines at the 
time of the naturalization of the parent." It must be remembered that this 
provision confers on a person a primary right, a status, the Philippine 
citizenship. The term "dwelling" used in the law could not, therefore, be 
referring to mere physical presence in this country. That the law must have 
intended none other than <i>domicile</i> can also be inferred from the 
requirement of permanent residence before foreign-born minors, who are not in 
the Philippines at the time of the naturalization of their parents, can acquire 
the unqualified status of a Filipino citizen.</p>
<p>It may here be stated that on September 13, 1966, and long after the issues 
in this case have been deliberated upon and considered by this Court, 
petitioners-appelles filed a manifestation and motion praying for the dismissal 
of this appeal on the ground!that it has already become academic. It was therein 
stated that petitioner Lim Wun Chee had voluntarily left the Philippines and 
thereafter entered the country as a quota immigrant under Section 13(a) of 
Commonwealth Act 613, as amended by Republic Act 503, and that the cash bond 
filed with the Commission of Immigration was already refunded to them. Be that 
as it may, in view of the facts obtaining in this case and to serve the ends of 
justice and State-welfare, we find it necessary to pass upon the merits of this 
appeal. It may be pointed out that even the minor children should have been 
asked to depart first and allowed to re-enter as non-quota immigrants.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, and for all the foregoing considerations, the decision of 
the lower court appealed from is hereby re- versed and set aside. The attention 
of the Solicitor General is hereby called to the facts uncovered by this case, 
for appropriate action. No costs.</p>
<p><b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><i>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, 
Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar</i> and <i>Ruiz Castro, JJ</i>., 
concur.<br><i>Makalintal, J</i>., concurs in the result.<br><br><br>

naturalization case that for having allegedly resided in the Philippines 
continuously for more than 30 years, and having <em>enrolled his children of 
school age in government-recognized schools, Co Pek was exempted from filing a 
declaration of intention</em>. This petition for citizenship was filed on 
February 16, 1960. His wife and minor children arrived in the Philippines only 
on <em>December 16, 1960</em>. And yet, the representative of the Solicitor 
General submitted the case for the government <em>without introducing any 
evidence</em> except Exhibit "1", which is the applicant's own handwriting in 
English with the corresponding Tagalog translation. (pp. 8-13, 
Record.)<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> During the hearing of 
Co Pek's petition to take the oath, the representative of the Solicitor General, 
when asked by the court, manifested that he was submitting the case for 
resolution <em>without memorandum or opposition</em>. Considering only the 
evidence presented by applicant, the court found the petition to be 
well-taken,and authorized the oath-taking of Co Pek. This hearing was held on 
<em>March</em> <em>29, 1963</em>. The petition in this prohibition case where 
certain admissions were made, was filed on <em>September 5,
