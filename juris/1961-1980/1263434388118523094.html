S. Milado of Regional Office No. <span style="">XI, </span>Cagayan

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner, Domingo
Larioma, filed with the Workmen's Compensation Unit, Regional Office No. XI,
Cagayan de Oro City, of the Department of Labor, a Notice of Injury or Sickness
and Claim for Compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim
for compensation alleged that Domingo Larioma was employed by the respondent,
Maria Cristina Fertilizer Corporation, on October 1, 1960, as maintenance man
in a pyrite-acid plant with a monthly salary of P195.00; that he worked for
eight hours a day from Monday to Friday; that on May 11, 1971, Domingo Larioma
stopped working due to an illness of acute hepatitis and returned to work at
the end of June 1971; and that on July 1, 1971, he again stopped working due to
another ailment, coronary heart disease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not appear that he returned to work thereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="9"><span style="">September
 16, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
referee, Rodolfo S. Milado, rendered a decision dismissing the petitioner's
claim for compensation for not being supported by substantial evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The claim was elevated to
the then Workmen's Compensation Commission for review but said body failed to
decide the case before its abolition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The function of the defunct Workmen's Compensation Commission was
subsequently taken over by the Workmen's Appeal and Review Staff in the Office
of the Minister of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1977</st1:date>,
Minister of Labor Blas F. Ople "failing to find any evidence, medical or
otherwise, that would warrant the reversal of the referee's findings,"
issued an order affirming the decision dated <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1974</st1:date> of Referee Rodolfo S. Milado dismissing
the peti­tioner's claim for compensation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue involved in this petition for review is whether or
not the ailments of Domingo Larioma are compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that Domingo Larioma became ill of acute hepatitis
and of coronary heart disease during his employment with the Maria Cristina
Fertilizer Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">said </span>illnesses having supervened during
his employment, there is a disputable presumption that the claim is
compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The claimant is relieved of the duty to prove causation as it is then legally
presumed that the illnesses arose out of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof is shifted to the
employer to show that the ailments are not compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The private respondent, Maria Cristina Fertilizer Corporation, has failed to
adduce evidence to prove that the ailments of the petitioner were neither
caused nor aggra­vated by <span style="">his </span>employment
as maintenance worker in its pyrite-acid plant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner is
entitled to compensation for complete disability and reimbursement of his
medical expenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision sought to be reviewed is hereby
set aside and the respondent, Maria Cristina Fertilizer Corporation, is
ordered:</p>

<p class="NUM">1) To pay the petitioner the amount of Six Thousand Pesos
(P6,000.00) as disability <span style="">compensation;</span></p>

<p class="NUM">2) To reimburse the petitioner his medical expenses duly supported
by receipts;</p>

<p class="NUM">3) To pay the petitioner the amount of Six Hundred Pesos (P600.00)
as attorney's fees; and</p>

<p class="NUM">4) To pay the successor of the Workmen's Compensa­tion Commission
the amount of Sixty-one Pesos (P61.00) as administrative fee.</p>
