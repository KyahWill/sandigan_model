30, 1960 Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>, a forty-three-year old
hacienda overseer, was feloniously killed in a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>
located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Suclaban</span>, Mexico, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> by three armed persons wearing army fatigue
uniforms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>
sustained eight gunshot wounds and three incised wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His eyes were eviscerated (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
incised wounds affected the brain tissue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The third incised wound was on the "plantar surface" of the
right foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death was due to hemorrhage
brought about by the eleven wounds (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).</p>

<p class="BODY">Question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> Commander Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
one of the three assailants of Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>?</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Jacob <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>, the
victim's fifteen-year old son, he and his father, together with <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dionicio</span>, a tenant, were
in the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> of <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magat</span> at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Suclaban</span> in
the morning of <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Isaac was <span class="SpellE">Magat's</span>
overseer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacob and <span class="SpellE">Dionicio</span>
were repairing the rice paddies (<span class="SpellE"><u>pilapil</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">While engaged in that task, they heard shouts of "Hoy!
Hoy!" emanating from the bamboo groove about sixty meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacob saw three men in army fatigue uniforms,
with caps and <span style="">combat </span>shoes and
armed with rifles, emerging from the bamboo thicket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ran towards <span class="GramE">the</span>
spot where Isaac and his son were working.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were firing their guns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sensing danger, Jacob lay down on the ground near a rice
paddy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dionicio</span>
scampered and concealed himself in the sugarcane plantation nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Isaac tried to flee <span style="">in </span>the same direction but he stumbled and fell face down on the
field about eight paces away from his son Jacob.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three malefactors, one of whom was later identified by Jacob
as Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, approached Isaac.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> kicked him
and turned his face up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> asked Isaac whether Jacob was his son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Isaac shook his head or denied that Jacob was
his son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(He did so in order to save his
son's life, as surmised by the trial court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> and his two companions
repeatedly fired their guns at Isaac.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the <span class="GramE">trio</span> fired at Isaac's eyes and then
remarked "<span class="SpellE">Patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> took
Isaac's bolo from the latter's waist and, with a laugh, hacked Isaac on the
forehead and slashed his toe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> had warned Jacob to stay put for an hour, the three
men left the field.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacob noticed that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> had a sharp nose, a mustache and a gold tooth.</p>

<p class="BODY">Isaac moaned with pain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His head and face were bloodied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jacob embraced his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
back part of his head was soft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacob
could not recognize him anymore.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, Francisco D. <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>, a
thirty-year old <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver, takes up the thread
of Jacob <span class="SpellE">Tanglao's</span> story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Lingad</span></span><span class="GramE">, in his sworn statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">F),</span> declared that in that morning of August 30, he was in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Suclaban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was parked on the roadside near
the <span class="SpellE">Pasudeco</span> railroad track and the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> of <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> (p. 12, Record).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While waiting for passengers, he heard gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About ten minutes later, three armed persons
in fatigue uniforms accosted him and asked him to drive them to the
Constabulary headquarters at <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They apprised him that they had killed a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> was taken aback.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The smallest of the trio had a regular build and a fair complexion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second was slightly taller than the
first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third; <span class="GramE">who</span>
was as tall as <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> but with a heavier build, was
brown and had a sharp nose and a mustache (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F).</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the three persons poked a carbine at <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>
and ordered him to proceed to Angeles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> had <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>
a short distance, he was ordered to stop in front of the combination warehouse
and residence of Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span> which was near the
chapel (p. 12, Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of the
malefactors alighted from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and talked with
Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>, the wife of Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>,
who was in front of the warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
asked her about the gun of Isaac.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she did not answer, they entered the bodega and went up the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes later, they came down from the
house with two carbines, a <span class="SpellE">Garand</span> rifle and a pistol
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F) <span class="GramE">or</span> one carbine and
a <span class="SpellE">Garand</span> rifle (pp. 6-7, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> heard the two men telling Ursula
<span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> that they had killed her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three men repaired to the nearby house of
<span class="SpellE">Menen</span> Miranda and asked for water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, they instructed <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>
to drive them to the <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> hacienda where they
alighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>
went to the Constabulary headquarters at Angeles and reported the incident (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F).</p>

<p class="BODY">Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>, the victim's widow,
testified that at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1960</st1:date>,
while she was in the bodega of <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>, where her family had living quarters, she heard
gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some minutes later, a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> stopped in front of the bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She noticed that the three armed passengers
in the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">jeepney</span></span><span style=""> were wearing fatigue uniforms with big
pockets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They jumped out of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, approached her, held her wrists and pointed their
guns at her breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them held her
left shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The person who held her
wrists was Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the malefactors went up the house and
seized the carbine and the <span class="SpellE">Garand</span> </span>rifle of her
husband, <span style="">Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> told
her:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We are going to kill you also
now because we killed already your husband".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not make any reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The malefactors left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>
declared that she and the deceased had seven children of whom the youngest was
six months old at </span>the <span style="">time he
was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband earned sixty to
seventy pesos </span>a <span style="">week as
overseer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>She <span style="">spent P625 for the </span>funeral.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 15 and 22, 1960 Jacob <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>
and his mother, Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>, were investigated by
Constabulary agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were shown a
photograph (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One</span> of the three persons in that
photograph, who was Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> (he was in
uniform and he had a mustache) was fingered by Jacob and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span> as one of the three persons whom they saw in the
morning of <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the first time that they learned
that one of the assailants of Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span> was <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, alias Commander <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1960</st1:date>
an investigator of the Constabulary Criminal Investigation Service (CIS) filed
a complaint for murder against <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> and two John
Does in the justice of the peace court of Mexico.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacob, <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span> and
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span> testified at the preliminary

</span>After trial, during which <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> pleaded an
alibi, the trial court convicted <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> of murder,
sentenced him to </span><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">perpetua</span></u></span><span style="">, and ordered him to indemnify </span>the
heirs of Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span> in the sum of six thousand
pesos (Criminal Case No. 4872).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">His counsel did not make any assignments of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his brief, he attacks the credibility of
the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that, if according to Jacob he lay flat on the
ground face down near the dike, he could not have seen his father's
assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That contention does not
take into account Jacob's entire testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jacob also testified that he saw the three malefactors for about eight
minutes when they approached his father and assaulted him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the cross-examination, he made a
sketch (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">G or 1) of the scene
of the crime and the positions of his father, himself and the three assailants.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even demonstrated how <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
stabbed his father in the head and toe with his (Isaac's) own bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacob declared:</p>

<blockquote>"If for instance at that time I was in this place (witness
pointing to the testimonial chair) my father then was in this place (witness
pointing to the place where Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> is), and
the accused Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was at this place then
(the witness pointing to the place where the witness was), and the said accused
<span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> took hold of the bolo of my father who was
then in a lying position, naturally he placed himself in such a way that he was
facing (me) and then I saw him in that moment." <span class="GramE">(29 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> </span><st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 12, 1965</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Jacob's testimony appears to be credible and trustworthy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's counsel also impugns the testimony of Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues
that it was impossible for <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> to hold the wrists
of Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> and at the same time point a rifle
at her breast, unless <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> had three arms, the
third of which was used to hold his rifle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That argument is misleading.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> declared that another person,
not <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, poked the rifle at her chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will
you please demonstrate the respective places of these three (3) persons when
they held you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>,

stepped down from the testimonial chair and then placed herself in front of the
interpreter who is taking the place of the witness (Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>)
and began to hold the two wrists of the interpreter (playing the role of Ursula
<span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>) and said that one of those persons placed
himself at the left side of the interpreter and began to hold the left shoulder
of the said interpreter and at the same time was pointing his gun at him
(meaning Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>), and that person </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">front of the interpreter, who was holding the two wrists said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Garand</span>,

<p class="BODY">The foregoing testimony shows that Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>
had sufficient opportunity to remember the features of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
and to connect him with the person, admittedly <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>,
found in the photograph, Exhibit C.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's counsel
capitalizes on the discrepancy between Jacob's testimony that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> had a mustache and Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan's</span>
hazy recollection that he did not have a mustache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>
testified more than four years after she saw <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That detail as to whether he had a mustache
or not might </span><span style="">have</span><span style=""> slipped from her memory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The variance of her testimony on that point

twenty years old only and to have the same height as <span class="SpellE">Dionicio's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(During the trial the height of <span class="SpellE">Dionicio</span> was found to be five feet and five inches </span>and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As shown in the

not know that barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
"shell-shocked" or he was sick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He never knew the spouses Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span> and
Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> and their son Jacob.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that it was against the HMB rules
that an assassin should have a companion in the performance of his
mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He averred that his

showed him a bunch of papers containing criminal charges against him in the
different courts in <st1:place>Central Luzon</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allegedly said that if he refused to
cooperate, they would prosecute all those cases and he would languish, or even
die, in jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that when he
stubbornly refused to be an informer, the Constabulary authorities methodically
maltreated him not by means of physical punishments, but by using
electricity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The maltreatments allegedly
affected his eyesight.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove that he was repeatedly framed up by the Constabulary, he
presented Exhibits 5 <span style="">to </span>10,
showing that the three murder cases filed against him in the municipal court of
Mexico, the double murder case filed against him in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Magalang</span>, the two double murder cases and a kidnapping with
murder case filed against him in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Arayat</span>
were all dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a conscientious evaluation of the evidence, we are
convinced that the trial court did not err in concluding that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> participated in the killing of Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The unwavering identification of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>,
which was made by the <span style="">eyewitnesses,
Jacob <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span> and Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>
and which dovetails with the statement of another eyewitness, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">F),</span> </span>establishes
<span class="SpellE">Cunanan's</span> guilt to a moral certainty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing was <span style="">qualified
by abuse </span>of <span style="">superiority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> and his
comrades took advantage of their manifest superiority in liquidating Isaac <span class="SpellE">Tanglao</span>, their unarmed and defenseless <span class="GramE">victim<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>Arts. 14[15], Revised Penal Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The aggravating
circumstances of evident premeditation and craft, which were alleged in the
information and were appreciated by the trial court, were not clearly
established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The malefactors resorted to a disguise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance did not facilitate the
consummation of the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Nor was it taken advantage of by the malefactors in the course of
the assault.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the
prosecution's version, at the incipiency of the attack, <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
and his companions did not camouflage their hostile intentions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They announced their presence at the scene of
the crime with shouts and gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
mode of attack counteracted whatever deception might have arisen from their
disguise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It even negated the, existence
of treachery since the element of surprise, which marks the presence of
treachery, was absent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There being no modifying
circumstances, <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, the
medium period of the penalty for murder, was properly imposed by the trial
court (Arts. 64[1] and 248[1], Revised Penal Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's judgment is affirmed with the modification that
the indemnity should be increased to twelve thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the
appellant.</span></p>
