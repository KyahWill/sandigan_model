				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal taken by &nbsp;Arminio, Oscar, Apolinario and Danilo, all surnamed Rivera, from the order of the Court of First Instance of Rizal dated January &nbsp;9, 1960 in &nbsp;Special Proceedings No. 1709 approving the Final Report of Accounts submitted by Remedios E. Espiritu as guardian of the estate of Marcosa Rivera. <p>On March 2, &nbsp;1953, &nbsp;appellee was appointed guardian &nbsp;of the estate of the&nbsp; above-named &nbsp;incompetent. &nbsp;The &nbsp;latter died &nbsp;on &nbsp;September 11, 1957, and &nbsp;Remigio &nbsp;R. Espiritu, appellee's brother, &nbsp;was &nbsp;appointed executor of her &nbsp;testate estate (Sp. Proc. No. 2826 of &nbsp;the &nbsp;same court).</p> <p>On May 20, 1959, appellants-nearest relatives and heirs of the deceased Marcosa-filed a motion &nbsp;for &nbsp;contempt &nbsp;in the guardianship proceedings against appellee due to her failure to &nbsp;render an &nbsp;accounting of &nbsp;the properties &nbsp;of her deceased ward. &nbsp;&nbsp;In its order of September 29, &nbsp;1959, the Court &nbsp;denied the &nbsp;motion but directed &nbsp;appellee to render an accounting within a period of one month from notice. Pursuant thereto, appellee filed her verified Final Report of Accounts on October 29, 1959, to which appellants filed a written opposition, alleging, &nbsp;among &nbsp;other things, that it was incomplete as it did not account for certain personal properties &nbsp;of the ward and other fruits &nbsp;of her estate. But &nbsp;on the date &nbsp;set for the hearing of the report, appellants and their counsel &nbsp;did not appear.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Court, finding said report to be "reasonable and in order", approved it. Appellants' motion for reconsideration having &nbsp;been denied, &nbsp;they &nbsp;took the present appeal.</p> <p>The only assignment of &nbsp;error submitted &nbsp;by appellants is to the effect that the &nbsp; lower court erred in approving the &nbsp;report &nbsp;mentioned heretofore &nbsp;without receiving &nbsp;any evidence in support thereof, inspite of the fact &nbsp;that the same appeared to be incomplete. We find this &nbsp;claim to be without merit.</p> <p>As the lower court observed, the report was &nbsp;verified, and &nbsp;the opposition thereto filed by &nbsp;appellants was couched in general terms and was not under oath. &nbsp;To this must be added the circumstance that appellants failed to appear on the day set for the hearing and, consequently, failed to substantiate &nbsp;the claim &nbsp;advanced in &nbsp;their opposition. We can not say, therefore, that the lower court &nbsp;erred in finding the final report of accounts in question to be "reasonable", considering that the same was detailed &nbsp;and &nbsp;was supported by the affidavit of the guardian.</p>  <p>Moreover, &nbsp;appellants' motion for reconsideration &nbsp;was not &nbsp;verified &nbsp;nor supported with &nbsp;any &nbsp;kind of &nbsp;evidence reasonably supporting their claim &nbsp;that &nbsp;appellee's report was &nbsp;incomplete. Neither did it specify the &nbsp;jewelries allegedly belonging to the deceased incompetent &nbsp;Marcosa Rivera, received by the guardian and not included in her final statement of accounts. We find, &nbsp;therefore, &nbsp;that the lower court &nbsp;was &nbsp;justified &nbsp;in &nbsp;denying the same.</p><p>Wherefore, the order &nbsp;appealed from is affirmed, &nbsp;with costs.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. J. Padilla, Barrera, Parades, &nbsp;Regala,</i> and<i> Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur. </p></div>
