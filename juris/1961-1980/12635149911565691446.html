<p class="BODY">Claiming to be a laborer of Hoc <span class="SpellE">Huat</span>
Trading hereinafter referred to as petitioner - on October 4, 1962, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> filed with Regional Office No. 4 of the Department
of Labor, Manila - herein­after referred to as the Regional Office - <span style="">a </span>claim for compensation docketed as
RO-Case No. 2426 based upon injuries allegedly suf­fered by him, while in the
performance of his duties, on <span style="">May </span>10,
1962, <span style="">resulting in permanent partial
disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appropria</span>te<span style=""> </span>proceed­ings, on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1963</st1:date>, hearing officer Rodolfo M.
Santos rendered a decision in favor of <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> and <span style="">against </span><span class="SpellE">pettitioner</span>,
for the aggregate sum of P765. 35, apart from the sum of. P13.00 due, as to <span style="">said </span>Regional Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over two (2) months later, or on December 12, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> filed - pursuant to section 51 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act1<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
civil case No. 55709 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XI,
presided over by Hon. Guillermo Santos, Judge, for the execution of the award
in said RO-Case No. 2426, which had alleged­ly become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, no appeal having been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
as attested to by a certification to this effect, issued by the then Acting
Regional Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 13,
1963, the relief prayed for, in said case No. 55709, by <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>,
was opposed by pe­titioner herein, upon the ground that its counsel had not,
due to over­sight, informed his, client of said award; that petitioner's
failure to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was due, therefore, to
fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence; and that, petitioner has a
"substantial <span style="">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>defense, as set
forth in <span style="">an </span>affidavit of
petitioner's manager, attached to its aforementioned opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner prayed, therefore, that the award
be <span style="">set </span>aside, pursuant to Rule
38, Section 1, of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, petitioner filed, with the Regional Office, an
"urgent motion for reconsideration to set aside the decision and for new
trial", based upon the allegation that the award in RO-Case No. 2426 is
contrary to law and to the facts; that petitioner had newly dis­covered
evidence, which could alter the result of the case; and that, its failure to
seasonably seek a review of the award had been "due to lack of knowledge
and information" about its rendition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting on said urgent motion, on <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="2">February
 11, 1964</st1:date>, the hearing officer author­ized the petitioner to file a
petition for review, which was, in fact, filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
petition was, on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1964</st1:date>,
forwarded by the hearing officer of the Workmen's Compensation Commission -
hereinafter referred to as the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="12">December
 21, 1963</st1:date>, Judge Santos had rendered a "judgment/decree" o<span style="">verruling</span>, in effect, petitioner's
aforementioned opposition, and, sentencing, as well as directing the petitioner
to pay P765. 35 to <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>, pursuant: to the award in
RO-Case No. 2426, in addition to P100 as attorney s fees and the costs, apart
from the P13 due to the Regional Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The corresponding writ of execution having been issued on January .2,
1964, petitioner filed, on January 23, 1964, a motion to "set aside and/or
recall" said writ, after depositing with the cashier of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, the sum of P765.3 to prevent the sale of properties levied
upon by the Sheriff of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon
thereafter, or on January 24, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> filed a
motion pray­ing that he be authorized to withdraw and collect the amount so
deposited by petitioner and that the latter be, moreover, required to pay the
additional sum of P203.89, for the complete satisfaction of said
"Judgment/Decree" judge Santos granted this motion, despite
petitioner’s opposition thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of the order to this effect having been denied,
petitioner commenced the present action for certiorari, with preliminary
injunction, against Judge Santos, the Sheriff of Manila, the Disbursing Officer
of the Department of Justice and Loreto <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, maintains that Judge Santos had
committed a grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction,
"in issuing the order of March 12, 1964, authorizing <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span>
to withdraw and collect said cash deposit with the Sheriff of Manila, because
the authority to order the execution of the award <span style="">in </span>RO-Case No. 2426 presupposes the finality thereof, which is
allegedly negated by the due course, given by the hearing officer, to the
petition for review, filed on March 2, 1964, by petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be noted that the award of a
referee or Commissioner in a workmen's compensation case "shall become
final unless a petition for review of the same shall be filed by an interested
party, " which "petition <u>must</u> be filed within fifteen (15)
days after the entry of any referee's order or award of the Commissioner unless
further time is granted by the referee or the Commissioner <u>within said
fifteen (15) days</u>, " which "shall begin to run only after x <span class="SpellE">x</span> notice" of the entry of said order or award to the
parties concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, notice of the order-award of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1963</st1:date>, was received by petitioner's counsel on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="10">October 14,1963</st1:date>, so that said
period, of fifteen <span style="">(15) </span>days
expired on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted that, up to <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1964</st1:date>, <span style="">when </span>Civil Case No. 55709 was
instituted, petitioner had not done anything to appeal from said award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the records show that the first step
taken by the petitioner in connection therewith was its "urgent motion for
reconsideration" and to set aside the award, as well as for new trial,
filed on December 13, 1963, or sixty (60) days after notice of the award had
been served <span style="">on </span>petitioner's <span style="">counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's failure to appeal or <span style="">otherwise seek a review of said </span>award, within the statutory
period of fifteen (15) days, was allegedly due to "oversight" on the
part of petitioner' s counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
the affidavit of petitioner's manager in support of said urgent motion,
explicitly states that "for reasons <u>unknown</u>", said counsel had
failed <span style="">to communicate said award to his
client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such "reasons unknown"
do <u>not</u> and can not constitute </span>the "fraud, accident,
mistake" referred to in said Rule 38.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the "oversight" mentioned by the petitioner may and
does amount to "neglect, " it is <u>not</u> the "<u>excusable</u>"
neglect essential to the relief provided for in salt Rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is rather the neglect that should be
discouraged, censured and condemned,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
indeed, "if a final order or judgment can be reopened <span style="">every time a </span>party alleges that he has
not previously been aware thereof and that his attorney, on a mistaken notion
or without authority, has failed to appeal, the end of litigations would be
speculative, if not dependent upon the will of the parties "<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of the foregoing, decisions in workmen's compen­sation
cases, become, by express statutory prescription, final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
after fifteen (15) days from notice thereof, "unless previously
appealed," or a petition for review has been filed within the same period.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
As a consequence, it is, to say the least, debatable whether or not Rule 38 of
the Rules of Court could apply thereto without, in effect, modifying the law,
which, the Supreme Court can not do by Rules on pleadings, practice and
procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the spirit of Act
No. 3428 - which is to promote the expeditious disposal of workmen's
compensation cases, to the point of providing that "there shall be no
appeal" from the decision thereon of Courts of first Instance - seems to
be incompatible with the application there­to of Rule 38 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, by invoking the same,
petitioner has managed to defer for six (6) years the final determination of <span class="SpellE">Gremio'<span style="">s</span></span>
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of the relief sought
to be afforded by said Act to <u>incapacitated</u> laborers is manifestly
inconsistent with such delay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then again, the hearing officer merely forwarded the petition for
review to the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Neither</u>
the latter nor the hearing officer had set aside the decision-award of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the hearing officer found
"no error sufficient to justify any modification or amendment of said
decision.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, under
the Rules of Court, which petitioner herein invokes, a Court may order the
execution of a decision pending appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that said Rules are applicable to
the situation obtaining in the present case, we are not prepared to declare
that Judge Santos had committed a grave abuse of discretion in authorizing the
execu­tion of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
law<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
commands "any court of record in the jurisdiction in which the accident
occurred," to "render a decree or judgment in accordance" with
"a decision of any referee or <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>Commissioner
from which <u><span style="">no petition </span>for
review</u> or appeal has been taken within the time allowed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>"
which is fifteen (15) days from notice - upon presentation of certified copy of
said decision, which <span class="SpellE">Gremio</span> filed with the lower
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to note that petitioner herein had deposited
only <u>part</u> of the sum adjudicated to the claimant in this case, and that,
the aforementioned award of the hearing officer was affirmed in a decision
rendered, on October 8, 1965, by the Chairman of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission, which has, likewise, become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="7">July
 26, 1966</st1:date>, the Commission, therefore, demanded payment of said award
and petitioner's counsel replied, on <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1966</st1:date>, that the Commission could dispose of the sum deposited
with the Clerk of Court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="1">January
 23, 1964</st1:date>, as it may deem best.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the issue raised by petitioner herein <span style="">has thereby </span>become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition in this case should be, as it is
hereby dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court,
accordingly, dissolved, with costs against petitioner, Hoc <span class="SpellE">Huat</span>
