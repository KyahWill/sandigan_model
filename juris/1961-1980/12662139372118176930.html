<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Garcia, Lorenzo Agustin, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span> and Pedro 
Santiago seek either the disbarment or the suspension of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Abellardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span>, upon the ground 
that "instead of using his good office" as Assistant Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> "for peace and avoidance of trouble and bloodshed," 
he has allegedly availed of it "as an instrument of revenge, hatred, coercion 
and allied crimes," to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(a) That during the last 
agricultural year, the said <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> Valdez, <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Toledo and their representatives, through force 
and intimidation and with the aid of Assistant Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span>, who is a son-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Toledo, and armed men, took possession of the 
disputed real properties which are the subject of Civil Case No. 20, Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>; that presently, during the 
harvesting of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> planted thereon, the said 
<span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> Valdez and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> 
Toledo, with the aid of Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span>, Philippine 
Constabulary soldiers, and trucks and drivers of one Vicente Lu, a Chinese 
engaged in the logging business at San <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, have been taking away the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> harvested thereon, against the will and in spite of 
the protest of the undersigned petitioners;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(b) That on several occasions, 
criminal acts of physical injuries, grave coercion and robbery had been 
committed against the undersigned petitioners and the corresponding criminal 
charges were filed in the Municipal Court of San <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, by the Chief of 
Police of the municipality; that our desire to vindicate our rights before the 
courts had been thwarted by the efforts of Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>; that when the criminal case of grave coercion and 
physical injuries were filed in the Municipal Court of San <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, we were 
surprised to find out that charges were being investigated against the 
undersigned petitioners in the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(c) That on Tuesday, February 
18, 1964 and on Wednesday, February 19, 1964, Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span>, armed with a 
carbine rifle, personally supervised the trucks of the <span class="SpellE">chinaman</span> Vicente Lu and the Philippine Constabulary soldiers 
as guards, in carrying away the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> from the 
disputed real properties, in spite of the fact that on Tuesday, February 18, 
1964, the said Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> 
should have been appearing before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to prosecute a case which originated in the Municipal 
Court of San Clement, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(d) That on Wednesday, February 
19, 1964, in the presence of a Mr. <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span> and a Mr. 
<span class="SpellE">Labasan</span>, both Philippine Constabulary soldiers, 
Messrs. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span> and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> were mauled by 
Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Balneg</span>, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span>, 
and others who are representatives of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> Valdez and 
<span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Toledo."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the filing of the answer of 
respondent, who denied the main allegations in petitioners' complaint, the 
matter was referred, for appropriate action, to the Department of Justice, which 
caused an investigation to be conducted by Senior State Prosecutor, Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Orendain</span>. After due notice and hearing, the latter 
submitted his report, in which he found the facts to be as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sometime in the month of August, 
1944, Cosmo Valdez Civil Case No. 492 against the complainants herein, the 
witnesses, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span> and Domingo 
Agustin and several more persons including <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> who (occupied or tended to occupy and gather 
the produce of Lot No. 1 as described and defined in Transfer of Certificate 
Title No. 213413 which was and still is issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> Valdez. None of the defendants (complainants and 
witnesses in the above-entitled case) had any better title than a tax 
declaration which <span class="GramE">none</span> of them presented in the 
investigation of this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Balneg</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> and 
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Olegarro</span> for a time worked as tenants for some 
of the complainants and others in league with them. However, in the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> season of 1961—1962 (there is no showing that they 
worked over the disputed areas before 1061-1962) <span class="SpellE">Balneg</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> began to turn their produce over to the heirs or 
estate of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> Valdez, who had since died and to 
<span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> Toledo, father-in-law of the respondent, 
<span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span>, who for a 
lime before ho became an assistant provincial fiscal, was a lawyer in Civil Case 
No. 492 defending the rights of Toledo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Infuriated, perhaps, because of 
the turn-<span class="SpellE">coatism</span> of <span class="SpellE">Balneg</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span>, the 
complainants, at first led by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span> 
(apparently the new leader is <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Garcia) and 
company sought ways and means by which they may regain the lost produce now 
being turned over to the Valdez heirs and to <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> 
Toledo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"So on February 14, 1964, Ricardo 
<span class="SpellE">Agacete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span>, Lorenzo Agustin and Esteban <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> in <span class="SpellE">Urbiztondo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>. They had a proposition that they placed before 
<span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span>. If <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> and 
his men would gather of haul the harvest of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in 
the disputed area in <span class="SpellE">Doclong</span>, San <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, they (<span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> and his men) could keep two thirds of the haul and 
leave the remaining one third to <span class="SpellE">Agecete</span> and 
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The proposition was inviting and 
<span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span>, apparently, readily agreed. On February 16, 
1964, he went to the house of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span>. There 
he had a conference with <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span> and company. He made 
certain that 2/3 of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> would go to him and his 
men. At the same time, he ascertained that they would be supplied with some 
firearms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“The next day, on 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 17, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> and his men proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Doclong</span> where the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in 
question was being harvested and threshed by the men of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Valdez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> led by <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Balneg</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Olegario</span></span>. They met with opposition 
as <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> his men refused to give the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> saying did that the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> 
did belong to the men of <span class="SpellE">Doclong</span>. To scare them, 
either <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> or one of his men fired a shot. <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> then complained to the P.C. soldiers on the 
premises. <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Lomboy</span> and Domingo Agustin together with <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> were taken to </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Camp</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Makabulos</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> for investigation. After the 
investigation, because it was already late in the night and there was no 
transportation, <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lomboy</span> and Agustin were placed in the guardhouse to sleep. 
The next morning of </span><st1:date month="2" day="18" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 18, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
<span class="GramE">trio were</span> released after they signed a paper on which 
was stated that they went to <span class="SpellE">Makabulos</span> and slept there 
voluntarily—a standard operating procedure of peace officers who are afraid that 
they may be held liable for one offense or another. The three had their 
breakfast and lunch in <span class="SpellE">Makabulos</span> after Atty. Napoleon 
<span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span> 
came over to give each of them P5.00 for expenses and 
transportation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Due to the incident in the 
afternoon of February 17, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> was charged for attempted murder by the 
Constabulary. <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span>, scalded, went back to <span class="SpellE">Urbiztondo</span>. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Lomboy</span> passed by <span class="SpellE">Doclong</span> where he 
remained till the next day when he was seen on the premises in question together 
with Gregorio Arenas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In the morning of 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 19, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> who 
had heard that there were malefactors ("goons") from <span class="SpellE">Urbiztondo</span> led by <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> threatening the peace in <span class="SpellE">Doclong</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">San <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tarlac</span></span> proceeded to the area in question together with 
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> Valdez in the jeep of the latter. There 
they saw some P. C. soldiers. The respondent conversed with Cpl. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span> briefly. <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span> told <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> that two men of <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Lomboy</span> and Arenas, were still there. The fiscal 
accosted <span class="SpellE">Lomboy</span> and Arenas warning them with arrest 
for any trouble they would make and exhorting them to leave the premises. They 
left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“* * * * * * 
*”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is easy to see that the 
complainants in the above-entitled case concocted a story to even up matters 
with the Valdez heirs? <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaudencio</span></span><span class="GramE"> Toledo and the 
respondent.</span> Frustrated in everything they tried to do to acquire the land 
under question and the benefits of its produce, they thought of using force and 
intimidation. The succession of events in the afternoon of February 17, 1964 
proved favorable to them. By then, no one had yet come in the circumstances by 
which the men of <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> led by him had come into the 
scene. It was only after <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> revealed his story 
in March, 1964, that a connection was established between him and the defendants 
in Civil Case No. 402 of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>. Taking 
advantage of just such a situation, the complainants herein prepared affidavits 
accusing <span class="SpellE">Olegario</span> and company together with some P.C. 
soldiers for robbery. It was easy for them to do so in view of the practice 
obtaining in the Offices of Chiefs of Police throughout the country. Chiefs of 
Police usually, upon receipt of complaining sworn statements, draw up a 
complaint or complaints and forward the same to the Municipal Courts (formerly 
justice of the peace courts) for investigation and disposition, either to 
dismiss or issue a warrant of arrest. This is unlike the practice obtaining in 
Fiscals’ Offices who have the power to investigate and dispose of a given case 
as provided by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In this case it was no 
different; for the Chief of Police upon receipt of the affidavits of the 
complainants immediately filed Criminal Cases Nos. 120 and 121 with the 
Municipal Court of San <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>. But before there cases could he dismissed or even 
without awaiting for the dismissal of the cases of robbery the complainants very 
astutely changed the charge to grave coercion in order to include <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span>, the respondent 
here. This was preparatory to the filing of the above-entitled case with the 
Supreme Court and administrative charges with the Department of Justice and the 
Office of the President against the respondent assistant 
fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Unfortunately for <span class="SpellE">Milla</span>, the charges filed by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> against <span class="SpellE">Molacruz</span> did not 
include those who were in league with him (the complainants) because of absence 
of evidence to link them with him at the <span class="GramE">time,</span> 
otherwise the shoes would have been on the other foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is too clear to escape any 
notice that the witnesses of the complainants who executed their affidavits on 
February 20 and 22, 1964 (Annexes 'C and 'D') attached to the complaint, of 
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Agacete</span> and <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Agacete</span>, did not state that <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> was on the promises with a gun or guns or that he was 
there at all. But those who executed affidavits on </span><st1:date month="2" day="23" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 23, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
namely Adriano <span class="SpellE">Agsaoa</span> (a relative of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>), Domingo Agustin, 
<span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Labiano</span> and Larry 
<span class="SpellE">Neri</span> involved <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> one way 
or the other with the incidents. (See Annexes 'A', 'E' and 'F' of the 
Complaint).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> who executed an 
affidavit also on February 23, 1964, but who did not incriminate <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> in any way was carefully excluded from being a witness 
in (his investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In other words the involvement 
of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milla</span> in the 
incidents of February 17, 18 and 19, 1964 came to the so-called aggrieved 
parties as an afterthought when he had exercised his prerogatives as an 
assistant provincial fiscal in driving away alleged "goons" (who in reality were 
hired men of the complainants) from the premises in question. It is the duty of 
a public prosecutor to protect indent and law-abiding citizens from undue 
harassments and to maintain the peace over and above their powers to 
prosecute."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Accordingly, the investigator 
recommended dismissal of the charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Inasmuch as the foregoing 
findings and recommendations are supported by the record, the petition herein is 
hereby dismissed. It is so ordered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
