petitioner's motion to dismiss and holding that said court has jurisdiction to <span class="GramE">take</span> cognizance of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several persons had joined as plaintiffs in filing an action in
the Court of First Instance for damages against the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span></st1:place></st1:city>, and other defendants
(Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbudo</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> and
Mauro <span class="SpellE">Nebreja</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint charged that on 4 December 1964, a fire truck, type 0-10,
owned by the City of <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span>, and driven by <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Barbudo</span>, due to the
imprudence and recklessness of said driver and of his co-defendants, collided
successively with <span style="font-size: 11pt;">a<i> </i></span>delivery truck
of the Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., then passenger bus No. 4516 which was in the
act of overtaking <span style="font-size: 11pt;">a<i> </i></span>parked sedan,
and finally hit passenger bus No. <span class="GramE">PUB-4628.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the latter vehicle (PUB-4628)
was practically demolished, and several of its passengers were physically
injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the suit, filed to
recover alleged damages due to the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the City of <span class="SpellE">Iegazpi</span>
interposed a motion praying that, with the exception of the claim of Juan <span class="SpellE">Marbella</span>, the complaint be dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction, because the amount demanded by each of the passenger plaintiffs,
including the ratable share in the attorney's fees, did not exceed P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, hence their claims were within the exclusive civil
jurisdiction of the Municipal Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
support of its move, the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span></st1:place></st1:city>
invoked section 88 of the Judiciary Act (R.A. 296, as amended by R.A. 2613 and
3828):</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 88.</span> <span class="GramE">Original
jurisdiction in civil cases.</span> - In all civil actions, including<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span>those mentioned in Rules fifty-nine and
sixty-two (now Rules 57 and 58) of the Rules of Court, arising in his
municipality or city, and not exclusively cognizable by the Court of First
Instance, the municipal judge and the judge of a city court shall have
exclusive original jurisdiction where the value of the subject matter or amount
of the demand does not exceed ten thousand pesos, exclusive of interests and
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there are several claims or
causes of action between the same parties embodied in the same complaint, the
amount of the demand shall be the totality of the demand in all the causes of
action, irrespective of whether the causes of action arose out of the same or
different transactions; <u>but where the claims or causes of action joined in a
single complaint are separately owned by or due to different parties each
separate claim shall furnish the jurisdictional test</u>.' <span class="GramE">(
Underscoring</span> ours )''</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The counsel for the plaintiffs objected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance sustained the
objection, and overruled the motion to dismiss, holding that the case was
within its jurisdiction, in view of section 3 of Rule of Court 3, now Revised
Rule 2, section <span class="GramE">5, that</span> provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>Joinder</u></span></span><span class="GramE"><u> of causes of
action</u>.</span> -Subject to rules<b> </b>regarding jurisdiction, venue and <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties, a party may in one pleading state, in
the alternative or otherwise, as many causes of action as he may have against
an opposing party (a) if the said causes of action arise out of the same
contract, transaction or relation between the parties, or (b) if the causes of
action are for demands for money, or are of the same nature and character.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the cases falling under clause (a) of the preceding
paragraph, the action shall be filed in the inferior court unless any of the
causes joined falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of first Instance, in
which case it shall be filed in the latter court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the cases falling under clause (b) the jurisdiction shall
be determined by the aggregate amount of the demands, if for money, or by their
nature and character, if otherwise." applied in International Colleges vs.
<span class="SpellE">Argonza</span>, 90 Phil. 470, and <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> vs. Jose, 86 Phil. 523.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Unable to secure
reconsideration of the denial of its motion to dismiss, the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Legazpi</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> appealed directly to this Court, insisting
that the Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction over the claims of
plaintiffs, save that of Juan <span class="SpellE">Marbella</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue, therefore, is
whether jurisdiction should be determined by aggregate claims of all the
injured passengers or by the amount of each individual claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We rule for the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have ruled in A. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> vs. Jose, 86 Phil.
523, that the provisions of the Rules of Court, concerning <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of causes of action and permissive <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties
"in whom or against whom any right to relief in respect to or arising out
of the same transaction or series of transactions is alleged to exist",
are designed to save the parties "unnecessary work, trouble</span> and
expense, x x x and not to enlarge the court's juris­diction as applied to the
amount in controversy" (<span class="SpellE">cas</span>. cit. page
526).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This design is apparent from the
limitations expressed both in section 5 of Revised Rule 2, "subject to the
rules regarding <u>jurisdiction</u>, venue and <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of parties", as well as in section 6, Rule 3, on permissive <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties," except as otherwise provided in
these rules". The latter proviso, in effect, reiterates the limitations
expressed in Rule 2, section 5.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And it could not be
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution (section 2,
Article VIII) expressly vested in Congress," the power to define,
prescribe and apportion the <u>jurisdiction</u> of the various courts", so
that in determining whether or not a case lies within or without the
jurisdiction of a court, the statutory enactment is supreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter portion of section 88 of the
Judiciary Act (previously quoted) must be, therefore, the sole standard to be
reckoned with, and it plainly states that the test for joined causes of action
and parties shall be the individual claims, and not their aggregate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No resort to the Rules of Court is
permissible to cir­cumvent the statutory prescription.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Manifestly, the court
below was misled by the fact that in International Colleges vs. <span class="SpellE">Argonza</span> (supra) the claims aggregated to an amount beyond
the juris­diction of the Municipal Court; but each individual claim lay within
its jurisdic­tion, and we held that the aggregation could not be used to make
up a jurisdictional amount that would vest power in the Court of First Instance
to take cognizance of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the order of dismissal is annulled and set
aside, except as to plaintiff Juan <span class="SpellE">Marbella</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First instance is hereby
directed to dismiss the claims of the other plaintiffs since they are within
the jurisdiction of the proper municipal court, though they may properly be
joined therein in one single complaint</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
