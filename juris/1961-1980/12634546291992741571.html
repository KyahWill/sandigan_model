of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> against <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buco</span> alias Ramsey and six others, designated as
"Does",<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;">*</span></span></a> for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A com­plaint filed earlier included two other
accused, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> alias Commander Sol and Cornelio
<span class="SpellE">Caparas</span> alias Eden Lee, but these persons
subsequently died and were dropped from the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the remaining accused were at large
except <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Buco</span> who
was arrested in 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Buco</span> was arraigned, pleaded not guilty and proceeded to
trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution, thru Dr. <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Yumul's</span> testimony, established the fact of the killing,
thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">At around 7:30 to 800 P.M. of the 17th of May, 1955 in Sta. Ana
municipality, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>,
municipal health officer, and his wife were passing by the market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They saw their municipal mayor, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, standing near
the market, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Yumul's</span> wife asked him to inquire
from the mayor whether he could join the <span class="SpellE"><u>rigodon</u></span>
dance for a forthcoming (May <span style="">22) </span>celebration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the doctor approached the mayor, his wife
left for home.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> told Dr. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>
that he was too busy and could not join.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As it was Dr. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> who was supposed to
supervise the <span class="SpellE"><u>rigodon</u></span> practice, the mayor told
him to go home lest he would be missed thereat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As Dr. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> turned to go, he saw a blaze of
gunfire cut down the mayor who was 1-1/2 to 2 meters from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scampering for cover, he hid in a house near
the church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After 20 or 30 minutes, when
shouting had subsided, Engineer <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span> passed by
and told him that it was probably over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They went to the spot where the mayor fell and found him dead, lying
flat on the cement, with nine gunshot wounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> later performed the autopsy at the
hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">Philippine Constabulary Staff Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Reny</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> in­vestigated Francisco <span class="SpellE">Buco</span>
after his arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And before him, <span class="SpellE">Buco</span> signed a statement on February 6, 1956 (Exhibit B)
admitting, that Eden Lee and he killed <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> with an automatic carbine and a <span class="SpellE">garand</span>
rifle, respectively; he further identified his other companions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Salud</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
the deceased's widow, testified <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that her husband was administrator of the 90-hectare land of his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This point, as will be seen later, has a
bearing on the question of <u>why</u> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was
killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense sought to prove that the act of killing <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was but part of the crime of rebellion for which the
accused had already been charged on <st1:date year="1954" day="17" month="8">August
 17, 1954</st1:date> in the same Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 1940); that on <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1959</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Buco</span>
pleaded guilty to said rebellion charge and was sentenced, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the court finds the sad accused <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Buco</span> guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of simple rebel­lion, as defined and penalized
under Art. 135, paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code; and considering the
mitigating circumstances of (1) plea of guilty (Art. 13, par. 7); (2) that he
acted under the impulse of an irresistible force (Art. 12, par. 5); and (3)
lack of ins­truction (Art. 15, par. 1), which were admit­ted by Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span>, the court hereby sen­tences said <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Buco</span>, on recommendation
of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span>, to suffer the straight pe­nalty of
one (1) year and six (6) months of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> and to pay his proportio­nate share of
the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the fact that <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Buco</span> was apprehended on February 3, 1956, and has
been detained up to the present, the provincial warden is hereby authorized and
directed to release said accused from further confinement, in so far as this
case is concerned, it appearing, that he had been under detention for a period
at least double the penalty herein imposed; pro­vided, that there are no other
pending charges against him in any of the two branches of this court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"SO ORDERED.’</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And from this the defense argued that the
prosecution for murder constitutes double jeopardy for the same offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the statement (Exhibit B) taken by the PC, with is in
English, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Buco</span>
testified that he does not know how to read English; that Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Reny</span> <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> asked him to sign
it, saying that after his sign­ing it, he can go home; that for this reason he
signed it <span class="SpellE">tho</span> said statement was not made by him;
that after signing it, he was not sent home but to the provincial jail instead.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruling that <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> killing accomplished
on May 17, 1955, was an act of murder not included in the charge of rebellion
which covered the period from May 28, 1946 to August 17, 1954, the Court of
First Instance on March 15, 1962 rendered judgment rejecting the plea of double
jeo­pardy, finding <span class="SpellE">Buco</span> guilty of murder and
sentencing him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to
pay P6,000.00 as indemnity to the heirs of the deceased, and proportionate
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appealing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to Us, <span class="SpellE">Buco</span> contends that (1) the killing of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
was absorbed in the rebellion for which he had been charged and sentenced; and
(2) that he was not sufficiently identified as one of the killers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The act of killing <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, which
appellant is now charged with, is not among those acts alleged in the pre­vious
case as constituting the offense of rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said act could not have been so charged since it was committed <u>after</u>
the filing of the rebellion charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
having been included in the rebellion charge, said killing is not absorbed in
the rebellion offense therein charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Egual</span>, G.R. Nos. L-13469, L-14240,
L-14209, <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1965</st1:date>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant has also failed to establish that the reason for the
killing of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was to further or carry out
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
was a mayor, and true, at the time of said killing, <span class="SpellE">Buco</span>
was still a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> and at large, as the dates may be
outlined, thus:</p>

<blockquote><st1:date year="1954" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1954</st1:date>
- charge of rebellion</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:date year="1955" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1955</st1:date> -
murder was committed</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:date year="1956" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1956</st1:date>
- accused was apprehended </blockquote>

<blockquote>1956 - ceased to be a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1959</st1:date> -
conviction for rebellion</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1959</st1:date>
- information for murder</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Yet the record shows that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was
ordered killed not because of said position or the functions of said office but
because of a private matter having to do with his capacity as administrator of
his father's 90-hectare land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> found, and as related in de­fendant's statement (Exhibit
B), Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> alias Commander Sol was moved by a
certain Luna, a mere civilian, to cause <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to be
killed because, according to said Luna, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
"was not good when it comes to the land" re­ferring to 90-hectare
land administered by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and in which Luna was
believed privately interested.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Apellant's</span> identification as among the
killers is found only in his statement (Exhibit B), which was first explained
to him in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, but also in his testimony in court
wherein he admitted the truth of the answers given said statement to the effect
that he and Eden Lee actually killed <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, using a <span class="SpellE">garand</span> rifle and carbine, respectively; and that Luna, a
civilian who wanted to join <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> "ordered"
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> because the latter was "not
good when it comes to the land." This negates appellant's contention that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was killed because he was responsible for the killing
of so many <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the penalty, We notice that the lower court took defendant's
admission during the trial that he killed <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as
mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty to offset the aggravating
circumstance of evident premeditation, af­ter considering treachery as a
qualifying circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that the admission of the killing took place after the presentation of the
evidence for the prosecution, the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty
cannot be considered (Art. 13, No. 7, Revised Penal Code; People v. <span class="SpellE">Quijano</span>, 74 Phil. 225).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, for lack of the required number of votes to impose the death
penalty, the penalty next lower in degree thereto, that is, <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, has to be imposed on the accused (Sec. 9,
Republic Act 296).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is herby af­firmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against appellant.</p>
