				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A case of pre-war vintage covering preferential right to
possession of a sixteen-hectare parcel of public land known as Lot 2104,
Pls-61, situate in <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, was first decided by the Director of Lands
in 1941, affirmed upon reinvestigation in 1954 by the Director of Lands,
reaffirmed in 1955 by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources who,
following three motions for reconsideration, declared his decision final in
1956 because the motions for reconsideration were filed out of time, finally
landed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
And this, because the prevailing party in the adminis­trative proceedings,
unable to obtain possession of which he was deprived since 1939, came to court
for assistance and asked that defendant be directed to vacate said Lot 2104 and
that he be awarded damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">But first to the background facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1941" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1941</st1:date>,
the Director of Lands decided Lands Conflict 374 (pre-war)<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
involving the aforesaid land in favor of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>, who filed Sales Application 22992, and
against defendant <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reconsideration of that deci­sion sought by <span class="SpellE">Aproniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>, son of
contestant <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>,
was rejected on <st1:date year="1941" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1941</st1:date>
by the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>More than
seven years</u> passed when on <st1:date year="1948" day="6" month="12">December
 6, 1948</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
sought reconsideration in the Lands Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His reason, amongst others, was that the reconsideration sought by his
son <span class="SpellE">Aproniano</span> was without his knowledge and
consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Lands Bureau reinvestigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, on October 8, 1954, in a lengthy
decision discussing the facts, the Director of Lands once again rejected the
claim of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> to
Lot 2104 [B.L. Claim 188(N)], ruled that the sales application of <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span> "shall be
given due course", and made this significant directive:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> shall vacate the premises and remove all [his]
improvements thereon at his own expense within 60 days from the receipt of his
copy hereof; otherwise, said improvements will be forfeited in favor of the
Government."</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fourteen</u> <u>years</u> after the original decision of the
Director of Lands; that is, on <st1:date year="1955" day="13" month="8">August
 13, 1955</st1:date>, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
affirmed on appeal (DANR Case 1170).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
afore­said, <span class="SpellE">Suson's</span> three successive motions for
'reconsideration were denied for having been filed out of time in the
Secretary's orders of January 5, 1956, April 26, 1956 and July 16, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this last named order of July 16, 1956,
the Secretary's ruling was pre­dicated upon two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>first</u>, that the three motions for
recon­sideration were time-barred; and <u>second</u>, that the evidence adduced
during the reinvestigation of this case and the records existing in the Bureau
of Lands established the fact that as between <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>, the former had the better right to the
disputed land.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The order expressly stated that the alleged valuable improvements placed by <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> were without doubt introduced in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason given was that <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
kept on occupying the lot <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the adverse decision
against him since 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In denying the
third motion for reconsideration, the Secretary ruled that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> this case insofar as this Department is concerned, is
considered a closed matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further
motion for reconsideration will not be acted upon and will only be filed for
record purposes."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1956" day="20" month="10">October
 20, 1956</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1956</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1957</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span> sought execution of the decision of the Director of
Lands of <st1:date year="1954" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1954</st1:date>
and paid the required execution fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1957</st1:date>, the Undersecretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources had to intervene to direct the Lands Director
to take immediate action on the execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, even with the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> directive that
report on the matter be given in ten days, the Director of Lands took no
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to obtain relief, plaintiff then commenced the present
action to settle the issue of possession of the land in the light of the
decision of the Director of Lands which plaintiff alleged to be long final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>, having received copy
of the complaint above-mentioned, filed a petition for executive review with
the Office of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was on <st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>On</u>
<u>the</u> <u>very</u> <u>same</u> <u>day</u>, he filed in court a motion to
dismiss the case upon the ground of <span class="SpellE">prematurity</span> and
lack of jurisdiction on the averment that he had elevated the case from the
Agriculture Department to the Office of the President,</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1957</st1:date>,
the trial court rejected the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was followed by the order of <st1:date year="1957" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1957</st1:date> denying reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1957</st1:date>,
defendant lodged with the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari and
prohibition docketed as G.R. L-12868, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Suson</span>, Petitioner, versus Honorable Mateo <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>, Judge, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>,
Respondents." Defendant <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> there emphasized
that the court below "may not yet acquire jurisdiction over the case"
since the petition for executive review was still pending in the Office of the
President and consequently defendant <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
(petitioner therein) had not as yet exhausted "all adminis­trative
remedies available." The petition charged that the trial court lacked
jurisdiction over the case itself, which petitioner claimed to be for enforcement
of the decision of the Director of Lands, and that the order requiring
petitioner to answer the com­plaint was without or in excess of the court's
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On, <st1:date year="1957" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1957</st1:date>, this Court overturned the
petition in a resolution, which reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<u>Considering</u> <u>the</u> <u>allegations</u> of the petition
filed in case L-12868 (<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
vs. Honorable Mateo <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>, etc., et al.) for
prohibition and certiorari, THE COURT RESOLVED to dismiss the petition for lack
of merit."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In <span class="SpellE">Suson's</span> petition for reconsideration, he stressed
the issue to be:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Does appeal to
His Excellency, the President of the Philippines, as the highest adminis­trative
officer of the land under the Constitution, from the decision of administrative
cases made exclusive and final by law, which in this case is the decision of
the Director of the Bureau of Lands, affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, constitute a part of administrative remedies available
to an aggrieved party in an administrative case?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so, with said appeal to the President
pending, may resort to court be made by a party to an administrative case, and,
if that is done, may the Court acquire jurisdiction over the case before the
Office of the President has resolved the appeal?" This Court, on October
15, 1957, resolved to deny the reconsideration sought, in a resolution which
reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Court, <u>deliberating</u>
<u>upon</u> <u>the</u> <u>grounds</u> of the motion for recon­sideration filed
by attorneys for the petitioner in case L-12868 (<span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Suson</span> vs. Hon. Mateo <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>,
etc., et al.), RESOLVES to deny the motion.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Final judgment was entered by the Clerk of this Court on <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1958</st1:date> on which date said entry of
judgment was forwarded to the clerk of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambo­anga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Back to the court below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Answer with counterclaim having been filed, the parties entered into a
stipulation of facts on October 8, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the reservation set forth in the stipulation, the parties presented
evidence solely as to the damages claimed by plaintiff in his complaint and by
defendant in his counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, judgment was rendered "ordering the
defendant, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>,
to vacate the premises and remove all his improvements inside Lot No. 2104,
Pls-61, <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, within two months from receipt of a copy of
this decision; to pay the plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span> the sum of THREE THOUSAND PESOS (P3,000.00) for
damages and a further sum of FIVE HUNDRED (P500.00) PESOS for attorney's fees
and to pay the costs."</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The meat of the case is
the jurisdictional issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tersely
stated, such issue simply is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the
lower court acquire jurisdic­tion to entertain the case on the face of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the petition for executive review in the Office
of the President of the Philippines?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
view is that it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for good
reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">A recital of the facts leads this Court to believe that all along
there was a clear pattern of conduct on the part of defendant with a view to
frustrating relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He indeed resorted
to delays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first adverse decision
against him, as we have adverted to earlier, was in August of 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration filed by his son was
thwarted on October 23, 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> did nothing
afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not appeal to the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, he has remained in possession - since 1939 - which he wrested
from plaintiff, in the words of the Director of Lands in his decision of
October 8, 1954, "by force of arms".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Fourteen</u> <u>years</u> after the 1941
decision of the Director of Lands elapsed when on August 13, 1955 the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resources
ruled that the Director of Lands was right and that <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>
should be given the possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant's three motions for recon­sideration, all filed out of time
and held unmeritorious, likewise failed of their purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be remembered that he only thought
of a petition for executive review on July 3, 1957, almost a year after his third
motion for reconsideration was rejected on July 16, 1956, and apparently
because plaintiff had sought court protection in the complaint he filed against
said defendant on June 18, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff, it bears stressing, has not enjoyed possession of the land
since 1939 to the present, or a period of <u>thirty</u> <u>years</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts amply convince this Court that
the prime objective of defendant in all of his moves both in the executive
department and in the courts was to stave off the inevitable day when he must
have to surrender possession of the land to plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an attitude this Court
unsympathetically rejects.</p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisdictional issue now raised was previously brought to
this Court in an effort to stop the lower court on its tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant here then sought relief urging that
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the executive review he sought from
the Office of the President of the Philippines should prevent the lower court
from proceeding with the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Denied
review on certiorari, he moved to reconsider specifically pointing out that the
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of such executive review was the core of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, passing upon this
motion for reconsideration, again overruled defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolutions denying the petition for
certiorari which have achieved finality constitute "the law of the
case."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Fernando</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Crisostomo</u></span>,
90 Phil. 585, 590, the issues on appeal were found to present substantially the
same questions raised in a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction
previously filed before this Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the probate
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, thru minute
resolutions, denied the petition for certiorari as well as a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we held that
"the reso­lutions of this Court constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> and the law of the case with regard to
this appeal and they can no longer be questioned and put in issue in the
present case."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Olarte</u></span>,
19 SCRA 494, 498, we held that a ruling in a previous case constitutes the law
of the case, and, even if erroneous, "may no longer be disturbed or
modified." We there added that "a subsequent reinterpretation of the
law may be applied to new cases but certainly not to an old one finally and
conclusively determined (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pinuila</span>, G.R. No.
L-11374, May 30, 1958; 55 O.G. 4228)."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We there defined the law of the case as meaning "that whatever is
once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision between
the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case, whether
correct on general principles or not, so long as the facts on which such
decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(21 C.J.S. 330)."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Really, since our pronouncement on the question of juris­diction
has become final it "is not subject to review or reversal in any court.”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The maxim here applicable is <u>non</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>quieta</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>movere</u></span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No longer is it
necessary, however, for the parties to argue about the executive appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, in the petition filed by plaintiff praying
for an early resolution of this case, attention is drawn to the fact that on
February 12, 1964, the Office of the President of the Philippines has finally
rendered a decision dismissing the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That decision recognized "<span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>'
undisputed possession and cultivation of said lot from 1934 until he was
forcibly dispossessed in 1939 by <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> who since then
has been in possession of the land." This, according to the Presidential
decision, is "one lucid conclusion" that "stands out
distinctly." The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of that
decision reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For all the
foregoing considerations, this Office cannot but sustain the DANR ruling that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>, has a better right to the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
lot and should be awarded the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
instant appeal is therefore dismissed for lack of merit."</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, plaintiff made out a case for the recovery of the land
in question.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also challenged by
defendant is the correctness of the award for damages and attorneys' fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court on this point said: "Considering
that the defendant has deprived the plaintiff of his legal right to possess and
occupy the property in question and the inconvenience of further court
proceedings could have been avoided if the defendant was only sensible and
prudent to obey or respect the decision of the Director of Lands, the court
believes, that the plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement of the expenses he
incurred in the enforcement of his rights and the amount of THREE THOUSAND
(P3,000.00) PESOS is believed to be reasonable for actual expenses and the
amount of FIVE HUNDRED (P500.00) PESOS for attorney's fees."</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant charges as erroneous the award of P3,000 for damages
mainly because there is no claim or allegation in plain­tiff's complaint that
the latter incurred alleged expenses and that it is not prayed for in the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the complaint indeed
asks are damages for the use and enjoyment of the land. We, however, examined
the transcript of the stenographic notes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We did so, for the reason that, as heretofore adverted to, evidence was
taken only on the question of the damages claimed respectively by plaintiff and
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's evidence shows
that the litigation expenses he incurred from the time the land had been in
dispute was P3,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No objection to such
evidence having been interposed by defendant during the trial, the latter
cannot now claim that the nature of the evidence proven in court is different
from that averred in the com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
is barred.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court notes that the attorneys' fees awarded below and
challenged here amount to only P500.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court's power to grant attorneys' fees is well within the ambit of Article
2208(11) of the Civil Code where attorneys' fees, other than judicial costs,
may be recovered "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n any other case where the court
deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> should be recovered.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, from the transcript we read that plaintiff testified on
direct examination - without objection from defendant's counsel - that he paid
around P1,000 to his other lawyers; and that on cross-examination, plaintiff
clarified that this was apart from the P500 he prayed for in the complaint,
which last amount was for his present counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the attorneys' fees granted below amounting to P500 are
only for services rendered in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They do not cover those rendered on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For certainly, the trial judge may not be in
a position to appreciate the factors which govern the assess­ment of counsel
fees beyond his court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we view the record, we are impelled to say that upon reason­able
appraisal, the attorneys' fees both in the lower court and in this Court should
be fixed at P1,500.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the reasons given</b>, the judgment under review is hereby
modified, only in the sense that defendant is hereby ordered to pay plaintiff
P1,500 by way of attorneys' fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all
other res­pects, the said judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court directs that defendant-appellant pay plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> treble costs.</p>
