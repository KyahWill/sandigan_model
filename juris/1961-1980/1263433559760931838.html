				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this Petition for Review by <i>Certiorari</i>, peti­tioner, a practicing
lawyer and businessman, seeks a reversal of the Decision of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 45005-R, which reduced his claim for damages for breach
of contract of transportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 26, 1967, petitioner was a fare paying passenger of
respondent Philippine Air Lines, Inc. (PAL), on board Flight No. 463-R, from
Mactan, Cebu, bound for Butuan City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was scheduled to attend the trial of Civil Case No. 1005 and Spec. Procs. No.
1125 in the Court of First Instance, Branch II, thereat, <span style="">set for hearing on August 28-31, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a passenger, he checked in one piece of
luggage, a blue "maleta" for which he was issued Claim Check No.
2106-R (Exh. "A").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plane
left Mactan Airport, Cebu, at about </span>1:00 o'clock P.M., and arrived at
Bancasi airport, Butuan City, at past 2:00 o'clock P.M., of the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival, petitioner claimed his luggage
but it could not be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
petitioner, it was only after reacting indignantly to the loss that the matter
was attended to by the porter clerk, Maximo Gomez, which, however, the latter
denies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about 3:00 o'clock P.M., PAL,
Butuan, sent a message to PAL, Cebu, inquiring about the missing luggage, which
message was, in turn, re­layed in full to the Mactan Airport teletype operator
at 3:45 P.M. (Exh. "2") that same afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have been transmitted to Manila
immediately, for at 3:59 that same afternoon, PAL Manila wired PAL Cebu
advising that the luggage had been overcarried to Manila aboard Flight No. 156
and that it would be forwarded to Cebu on Flight No. 345 of the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instructions were also given that the luggage
be immediately forwarded to Butuan City on the first available flight (Exh.
"3").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 5:00 P.M. of the same
afternoon, PAL Cebu sent a message to PAL Butuan that the luggage would be
forwarded on Flight No. 963 the following day, August 27, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this message was not received by PAL
Butuan as all the personnel had already left since there were no more incoming
flights that afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, petitioner was worried about the missing luggage
because it contained vital documents needed for trial the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 10:00 o'clock that evening, petitioner
wired PAL Cebu demanding the delivery of his baggage before noon the next day,
otherwise, he would hold PAL liable for damages, and stating that PAL's gross
negligence had caused him undue inconvenience, worry, anxiety and extreme
embarrassment (Exh. "B").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
telegram was received by the Cebu PAL supervisor but the latter felt no need to
wire petitioner that his luggage had already been forwarded on the assumption
that by the time the message reached Butuan City, the luggage would have
arrived.</p>

<p class="BODY">Early in the morning of the next day, August 27, 1967, petitioner
went to the Bancasi Airport to inquire about his luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not wait, however, for the morning
flight which arrived at 10:00 o'clock that morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This flight carried the missing luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The porter clerk, Maximo Gomez, paged
petitioner, but the latter had already left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A certain Emilio Dagorro, a driver of a "colorum" car, who
also used to drive for petitioner, volunteered to take the luggage to
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Maximo Gomez knew Dagorro
to be the same driver used by petitioner whenever the latter <span style="">was in Butuan City, Gomez took the luggage
and placed it on the counter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dagorro
examined the lock, pressed it, and it opened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After calling the attention of Maximo Gomez, the "maleta" was
opened, Gomez took a look at its contents, but did not touch them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dagorro then delivered the "maleta"
to petitioner, with the information that the lock was open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon inspection, petitioner found that a
folder containing certain exhibits, transcripts and private documents in Civil
Case No. 1005 and Sp. Procs. No. 1126 were missing, aside from two gift items
for his parents-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
refused to accept the luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dagorro
returned it to the porter clerk, Maximo Gomez, who sealed it and forwarded the
same to PAL Cebu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, petitioner asked for postponement of the hearing of
Civil Case No. 1005 due to loss of his documents, which was granted by the
Court (Exhs. "C" and "C-1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner returned to Cebu City on August
28, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated August 29,
1967 addressed to PAL, Cebu, petitioner called attention to his telegram (Exh.
"D"), demanded that his luggage be produced intact, and that he be
compensated in the sum of P250,000.00 for actual and moral damages within five
days from receipt of the letter, otherwise, he would be left with no alter­native
but to file suit (Exh. "D").</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 31, 1967, Messrs. de Leon, Navarsi, and Agustin, all of
PAL Cebu, went to petitioner's office to deliver the "maleta".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the presence of Mr. Jose Yap and Atty.
Manuel Maranga, the contents were listed and receipted for by petitioner (Exh.
"E").</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 5, 1967, petitioner sent a tracer letter to PAL Cebu
inquiring about the results of the investigation which Messrs. de Leon, Navarsi
and Agustin had promised to conduct to pinpoint respon­sibility for the
unauthorized opening of the "maleta" (Exh. "F").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following day,
September 6, 1967, PAL sent its reply hereinunder quoted verbatim:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Dear Atty. Ong Yiu:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is with reference to your September 5, 1967, letter to
Mr. Ricardo G. Paloma, Acting Manager, Southern Philippines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"First of all, may we apologize for the delay in informing you
of the result of our investigation since we visited you in your office <span style="">last August 31, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there are stations other than Cebu
which are involved in your case, we have to com­municate and await replies from
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We regret to in­form you that to
date we have not found the supposedly lost folder of papers nor have we been
able to pinpoint the personnel who allegedly pil­ferred your baggage.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"You must realize that no inventory was taken of the cargo
upon loading them on any plane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, we have no way of knowing the real contents of your
baggage when same was loaded.</blockquote>

incident but we trust that you will give us another opportunity to be of better
service to you.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 13, 1967, petitioner filed a Complaint against PAL for
damages for breach of contract of trans­portation with the Court of First
Instance of Cebu, Branch V, docketed as Civil Case No. R-10188, which PAL
traversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial, the lower
Court found PAL to have acted in bad faith and with malice and declared <span style="">petitioner entitled to moral damages in the
sum of P80,000.00, exemplary damages of P30,000.00, attor­ney's fees of
P5,000.00, and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals - petitioner in so
far as he was awarded only the sum of P80,000.00 as moral damages; and
defendant because of the unfavorable judgment rendered against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 22, 1974, the Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> find­ing
that PAL was guilty only of simple negligence, reversed the judgment of the
trial Court granting petitioner moral and exemplary damages, but ordered PAL to
pay plaintiff the sum of P100.00<span style="">, </span>the
baggage liability assumed by it under the condition of carriage printed at the
back of the ticket.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition for Review by <i>Certiorari</i>, filed on
May 2, 1975, with petitioner making the following Assignments of Error:</p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN
HOLDING RESPONDENT PAL GUILTY ONLY OF SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE AND NOT BAD FAITH IN
THE BREACH OF ITS CONTRACT OF TRANSPORTATION WITH PETITIONER.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS MISCONSTRUED
THE EVIDENCE AND THE LAW WHEN IT REVERSED THE DECISION OF THE LOWER COURT
AWARDING TO PETITIONER MORAL DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF P80,000.00, EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES OF P30,000.00, AND P5,000.00 REPRESENTING ATTOR­NEY'S FEES, AND ORDERED
RES­PONDENT PAL TO COMPENSATE PLAINTIFF THE SUM OF P100.00<span style=""> </span>ONLY, CONTRARY TO THE EXPLICIT
PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES 2220, 2229, 2232 AND 2234 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE
PHILIPPINES.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 16, 1975, this Court gave due course to the Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that PAL incurred in delay in the delivery of
petitioner's luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is
the correctness of respondent Court's conclusion that there was no gross
negligence on the part of PAL and that it had not acted fraudulently or in bad
faith as to entitle petitioner to an award of moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the facts of the case, <span style="">we </span>agree with res­pondent Court that PAL had
not acted in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bad faith means
a breach of a <span style="">known </span>duty through
some motive of interest or ill will.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>It was the duty of PAL to look for
petitioner's luggage which had been miscarried.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PAL exerted due diligence in complying with such duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly stated by the appellate Court:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We do not find any evidence of bad faith in this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, We find that the defendant
had exerted diligent effort to locate plaintiff's baggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court saw evidence of bad faith
because PAL sent the telegraphic message to Mactan only at 3:00 o'clock that
same afternoon, despite plaintiff's indignation for <span style="">the non-arrival of his baggage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The message was sent within less than one hour after plaintiff's luggage
could not be located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Efforts had to be
exerted to locate plaintiff's maleta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the Bancasi airport had to attend to other incoming passengers and
to the out­going passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
no evidence of bad faith can be inferred from these facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cebu office immediately wired </span>Manila
inquiring about the missing baggage of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 3:59 P.M., Manila station agent at the
domestic airport wired Cebu that the baggage was over <span style="">carried to Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this </span>message
was received in Cebu one minute thereafter, or at 4:00 P.M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The baggage was in fact sent back to Cebu
City that same after<span style="">noon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>His Honor stated that the fact that
the message was sent at 3:59 P.M. from Manila and completely relayed to Mactan
at 4:00 P.M., or within one minute, made the message appear spurious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a forced reasoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A radio message of about 50 words can be
completely transmitted in even less than one minute, depending upon atmospheric
conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the message was sent
from <span style="">Manila or other distant places, </span>the
message can be received within a minute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is a scientific fact which cannot be questioned."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither was the failure of PAL Cebu to reply to petitioner's rush
telegram indicative of bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
telegram (Exh. B) was dispatched by petitioner at around 10:00 P.M. of August
26, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PAL super­visor at Mactan
Airport was notified of it only in the morning of the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time the luggage was already to be
forwarded to Butuan City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
bad faith, therefore, in the assumption made by said supervisor that the plane
carrying the bag would arrive at Butuan earlier than a reply telegram.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had petitioner waited or caused someone to wait
at the Bancasi airport for the arrival of the morning flight, he would have
been able to retrieve his luggage sooner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the absence of a
wrongful act or omission or of fraud or bad faith, petitioner is not entitled
to moral damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 2217.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moral damages
include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched
reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar
injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though incapable of pecuniary
computation, moral damages may be re­covered if they are the proximate result
of the defendant's wrongful act of omission."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 2220.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Willful
injury to property may be a legal ground for awarding moral damages if the
court should find that, under the circumstances, such damages are justly
due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same rule applies to breaches
of contract where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is neither entitled to exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contracts, as provided for in Article 2232
of the Civil Code, exemplary damages can be granted if the de­fendant acted <span style="">in </span>a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, op­pressive,
or malevolent manner, which has not <span style="">been
</span>proven in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further contends that respondent Court committed grave
error when it limited PAL's carriage liability to the amount of P100.00 as
stipulated at <span style="">the back of the
ticket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, respondent
Court opined:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As a general proposition, the plaintiff's maleta having been
pilfered while in the custody of the defendant, it is presumed that the
defendant had been negligent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lia­bility,
however, of PAL for the loss, in accordance with the stipulation written on the
back of the ticket, Exhibit 12, is limited to P100.00 per baggage plaintiff not
having declared a great value, and not having called the attention of the
defendant on its true value and paid the tariff therefor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of this stipulation is not
questioned by the plain­tiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
printed in reasonably and fairly big letters, and are easily readable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, plaintiff had been a frequent
passenger of PAL from Cebu to Butuan City and <span style="">back, and he, being a lawyer and businessman, must be </span>fully
aware of these conditions."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the foregoing finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent Condition of Carriage printed
at the back of the plane ticket reads:</p>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BAGGAGE LIABILITY....<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total liability of the Carrier for lost
or damaged baggage of the passenger is LIMITED TO P100.00 for each ticket
unless a passenger declares a higher valuation in excess of <span style="">P100.00, </span>but not in excess, however,
of a total valuation of <span style="">P1,000.00 </span><span style="">and additional charges are paid pursuant to
Carrier's tariffs."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that petitioner did not <span style="">declare </span>any higher value for his
luggage, much <span style="">less did he pay </span>any
additional transportation charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioner argues that there is nothing <span style="">in </span>the evidence to show that he had
actually entered into a contract with PAL limiting the <span style="">latter's liability for loss or </span>delay of the baggage of its
passengers, and that Article 1750<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the
Civil Code has not <span style="">been </span>complied
with.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it may be true that petitioner had not signed the plane
ticket (Exh. "12"), <span style="">he is
neverthe­</span><span style="">less </span>bound by
the provisions thereof. "Such provisions <span style="">have been held to be a part of the contract of carriage, and valid and
binding upon the passenger regardless of the latter's lack of knowledge or
assent to the regulation".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is what is known as a contract of
"adhesion", in regards which it has been said that contracts of
adhesion wherein one party imposes a ready made form of contract on the other,
as the plane ticket in the case at bar, are contracts not entirely
prohibited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one who adheres to the
con­tract is in reality free to reject it entirely; if he adheres, he gives his
consent.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And as held in Randolph v. American
Airlines, 103 Ohio App. 172, 144 N.E. 2d 878; Rosenchein vs. Trans World
Airlines, Inc., 349 S.W. 2d 483, "a contract limiting liability upon an
agreed valuation does not offend against the policy of the law forbidding one
from contracting against his own negligence."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering, therefore, that petitioner had failed to declare a
higher value for his baggage, he cannot be permitted a recovery in excess of <span style="">P100.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Besides, passengers are advised not to place valuable items
inside their baggage but "to avail of our V-cargo service" (Exh.
"1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise to be
noted that there is nothing in the evidence to show the actual value of the
goods allegedly lost by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another matter involved, raised as an error by PAL - the
fact that on October 24, 1974 or two months after the promulgation of the
Decision of the appellate Court, petitioner's widow filed a Motion for
Substitution claiming that petitioner died on January 6, 1974 and that she only
came to know of the adverse Decision on October 23, 1974 when peti­tioner's law
partner informed her that he received copy of the Decision on August 28,
1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to her Motion was an
Affidavit of petitioner's law partner reciting facts constitutive of excusable
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate Court noting
that all pleadings had been signed by petitioner himself al­lowed the widow
"to take such steps as she or counsel may deem necessary." She then
filed a Motion for Reconsideration over the opposition of PAL <span style="">which alleged that the Court of Appeals
Decision, promulgated on August 22, 1974, had already become final and
executory since no appeal had been interposed therefrom within the reglementary
period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, considering the demise of petitioner
himself, who acted as his own counsel, it is best that technicality yields to
the interests <span style="">of substantial
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, in the last analysis,
no serious prejudice has been caused respondent PAL.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, we hold that the conclusions drawn by respondent Court
from the evidence on record are not erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for lack of merit, the instant Petition is
hereby denied, and the judgment sought to be <span style="">reviewed </span>hereby affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>.</p>
