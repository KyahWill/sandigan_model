in the evening of <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1969</st1:date>,
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> and his son Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>,
Jr. left their home in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
for Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Rosario, of the same
municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived in <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>,
they joined the game of the Diamante <span style="">Jump</span>ing
Horse which happened to be there because of the barrio fiesta which had just
been over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They won a prize consisting
of a glass bowl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They continued
playing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> arrived, drunk and shouting, "Stop the
game.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who is the bravest man in this
group?" brushing aside people who happened to be on his way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hand of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>,
Sr., which held the glass bowl was hit and the bowl fell down and was
broken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
asked, "What are you doing, <span class="SpellE">Benong</span>?' <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> boxed Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> and then drew his knife (Exhibit "B") and
stabbed Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> who was hit on the chin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> held
the hand of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>
which held the knife (Exhibit "B") and the two grappled for the
possession of the knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people
scampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
shouted, "Help, dispossess him of the knife." No one came to
dispossess <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> of his knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then all of a sudden <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>, the brother of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>,
appeared and stabbed Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
relaxed his grasp of the hand of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> who immediately
freed himself and right then and there stabbed Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
on his side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
fell to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two brothers
immediately rode on him and continued stabbing Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. of Police <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zaragoza</span> who was in the house of Victor Ramos heard
the commotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He jumped down and ran towards
the <span class="SpellE">feria</span> blowing his whistle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Zaragoza</span>
reached the place of the incident, he met <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> with butcher's knife (Exhibit "C").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Zaragoza</span> got
the knife from him and brought him by the side of the road and told him to stay
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He returned to the place of the
incident where he saw Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> laying on the
ground and <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>
standing by and looking at the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He placed <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>
under arrest and twisted his hand which held the knife (Exhibit "B")

station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on their way, they met

was still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked for the
butcher's knife (Exhibit "B").<span style="">&nbsp;

of the stabbing incident and the alleged surrender follows:</p>

<blockquote>In the evening of <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="10">October
 31, 1969</st1:date>, a week after the barrio fiesta, there were still various
games of amusement in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>, <span class="SpellE">Guimaras</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
among which were the jumping horse and shooting gallery (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.
pp. 12-13, <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine
 o'clock</st1:time> of that same evening in the same place, the accused <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>, younger brother of
the accused-appellant, went to the jumping horse stand owned by a certain Mrs.
Diamante with the intention of requesting the persons working therein to
announce the loss of his son <span class="SpellE">Arnaldo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the accused <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> was about to enter the jumping horse stand, he
accidentally slightly touched the bowl the deceased Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>,
Sr. was holding as his prize for winning a game causing the same to fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> was already inside the jumping horse stand, he was called
by the deceased to go out and the said accused went out of the jumping horse
stand whereupon he was confronted by the deceased in an angry and challenging
manner as to why he did not apologize for his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> asked for an apology and explained to the deceased
that his act of touching the bowl was unintentional and without malice,
whereupon the deceased Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr. struck him
with the bowl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, the accused <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> was not hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the deceased boxed the said accused but
again the latter was not hit as he was able to step backwards (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 18- 21, <span class="SpellE">Equia</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Inasmuch as there was no more place to step back as behind the
accused <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> was
already the jumping horse stand and the deceased made the motion of pulling
something from his back pocket, the said accused dashed towards the deceased,
hugged him and later <span style="">on </span>grabbed
from his back pocket what turned out to be a small knife (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, the
deceased being bigger and stronger than the accused <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>, pushed the latter against the wooden railing
of the jumping horse stand causing the back of the accused to hit one of the
threaded bolts joining the wooden railings and wounding him at the back which
wound bled profusely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the
accused <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> was
no match in strength against the deceased, the said accused, in order to free
himself from the grasp of the deceased made a thrust of the knife he was
holding and hit the deceased on the left chin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After this, they grappled for the knife (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pp. 21-22; 24-25, <span class="SpellE">Equia</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the above incident was taking the people around scampered for
safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The music from the jumping horse
stand stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about this time, the
accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>
was in his house about 100 meters away cutting "<span class="SpellE">kangkong</span>"
leaves for his pigs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, he
heard people running near his house and shouting that his younger brother <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> and the deceased
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr. were stabbing each other near the
jumping horse gallery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing this
and remembering that his children were also in the scene of the incident, the
accused-appellant proceeded thereto whereupon arrival he saw his younger
brother <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>
bloody at the back grappling for the knife (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B") with the deceased with the sharp pointed edge of the knife
already pointed very close to the neck of his younger brother and the deceased
was pushing it, and believing that the life of his brother was already in
imminent danger as with one push from the deceased who was very much bigger and
stronger the knife would penetrate the throat of his brother and kill him, the
accused-appellant rushed towards the deceased and stabbed him once only as may
be evidenced by the Autopsy Report (Exhibit "A") and by the declaration
of <span style="">Dr. </span><span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jabasa</span> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 5, 9, <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused appellant did not know which part
of the body of the deceased was hit because the latter was moving at the time
the former stabbed him (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 46-49, <span class="SpellE">Equia</span>; pp. 70-71, <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>).<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> once when he saw him (Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>) with a knife (Exhibit "A") very close to
and about to hit the neck of his brother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This claim is untenable because according to <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>

were grappling for the possession of the knife (Exhibit "A").<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> also claimed

and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Jr. (son of the deceased),
testified to the effect that when <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> arrived at the Jumping Horse Stand at Barrio Sta. Rosario
in the evening of Oct. 31, 1969, he said something like, "Stop the game,
who is the bravest in this group?" And then, <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
brushed aside Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr., causing a 'prize'
bowl that the latter was holding to fall to the ground where it broke into pieces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
drew a kitchen knife and thrust it upon Ramon, Sr. who was hit at the lower
chin</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A commotion at the stand
ensued while Ramon Sr. grabbed the hand of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
which was holding the knife as he shouted, 'Take away his knife.' but nobody
came to help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Just then, <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>, the appellant,
appeared from behind and stabbed Ramon, Sr. at the back</u><span style="">.</span><span style="">&nbsp;

as he fell, "they placed themselves on top (of Ramon, Sr.) and continued
hacking him</u>" (pp. 40, 41, 43-46, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Feb. 19, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>; pp. 50-52, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
March 12, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote><u><span style="">From the </span>above
narration of facts, the provocation and unlawful aggression undoubtedly came from
<span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued, however, that even if <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> provoked the fight, <span class="SpellE">Rubico's</span>
defense of a relative is still legitimate because when the fight between <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> and the deceased started at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, the accused-appellant
was not even in the scene of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's contention is, therefore, 'honest belief' that <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>, his younger brother, was a 'victim of aggression
of the deceased' (pp. 17-19, Appellant's Brief).</blockquote>

<blockquote>We find appellant's contention hard to believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted by the defense that when <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> arrived at the scene
of the scuffle, he saw <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> holding a kitchen
knife, although appellant claims to have seen Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>,
Sr. pushing the hand of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> (which was holding
the knife) towards the neck of the latter (p. 47, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
April 1, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Equia</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But from the defense's own admission, the
one holding the knife was <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> had no weapon at all</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It <span style="">was
</span>easier to infer that <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> was the aggressor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting that <span class="SpellE">Rubico's</span>
brother was then in danger because the knife he (<span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>)
was holding was being pressed towards his throat, <u>the question arises as to
the reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel the deceased' 'unlawful
aggression</u>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>
first testified that he stabbed Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr. 'in
the course of his grabbing with <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>', and he
altered his reply by saying that he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
when they were 'face to face with each other' and while Ramon Sr. and his
(appellant's) brother 'were both holding their hands and the knife was very,
very close to the neck of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>' (pp. 48, 50, 51, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>At such time, under the circumstances alleged by the defense, <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> could very well have helped his brother subdue <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> without the use of any weapon, and thus avert the
danger that allegedly threatened <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As</span>suming
that the passion of moment overwhelmed <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>, the
use of his knife against <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> in order to help his
brother certainly did not justify stabbing <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
with a fatal thrust (stab wound no. 1, Exhibit "A", p. 4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Jan. 26, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the first thrust of the knife by <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> must have been the fatal one is substantiated by the
fact that from his testimony, he stated that after he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, the latter released the hand of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> from his grip, whereupon, while Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr., <span style="">fell, </span><span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> also stabbed Ramon (p. 48, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
April <span style="">1, </span>1970, <span class="SpellE">Eguia</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is </span>interesting to note that the
accused <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> was
unable (or hesitated) to reveal the part of <span class="SpellE">Adayon's</span>
body which he hit with his knife, and that his testimony discloses a laborious
attempt to make it appear that there was no treachery when <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the evidence on record does not suggest this trend of thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>cannot
be true, as contended by the <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> brothers, that
they each delivered only one <span style="">thrust of
their knives upon </span><span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, because the medical
report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A") showed that a total of
five (5) stab wounds were sustained by the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, in the face of the undisputed fact that
<span style="">only the </span><span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>
brothers had fought with Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr. and that
immediately after the struggle between them, a policeman, a Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Zaragoza</span>, arrived and caused the former to be brought to
the police headquarters (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Feb. 6, 1970,
<span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>).<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim under the
second assigned error that the homicide was not qualified by treachery is also
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, again, as the
People's Brief explains, there is murder qualified by treachery when it appears
that the method of assault adopted by the aggressor was deliberately chosen
with a special view to the accomplishment of the act without risk to the
assailant from any defense that the party assailed may make - which was the
case of herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote>When <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> stabbed Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr., the indications are that he hit the latter at
the back (the fatal wound), considering that at that time <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>
arrived while his brother and the deceased were still struggling, and <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> had an easier <span class="SpellE">altho</span> mobile
target.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the least danger to himself,
it was not unnatural for him to have struck Ramon Sr. at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It has been held that there is murder
qualified by treachery when it appears that the method of assault adopted by

without risk to </u><u><span style="">the assailant

83 Phil. 738; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>, 84 Phil. 771).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worth mentioning that during the struggle
between <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> and
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> Sr.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span>
appeared from behind all of a sudden and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>
at the back (pp. 38, 44, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="2">Feb. 6, 1970</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Tauro</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This belies the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>) contention that when he stabbed Ramon, Sr.,
the latter was facing both the <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> brothers (p. 50,
<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., April 1, 1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Even then, <span class="SpellE">Rubico's</span>
own admission that 'Both <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> and Ramon were
running far from me, and in the course </u><u><span style="">of </span>their running from me, I hit him.' (p. 51, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., supra), lend credence to the theory of the
prosecution that treachery was used by <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> because
he had to</u><u><span style=""> </span>approach <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> when he stabbed the </u><u><span style="">l</span>atter, and when he did, <span class="SpellE">Ada<span style="">y</span>on</span> was helplessly unknowing of

<span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> with </u><u><span style="">any injury, </span>for, he had no weapon with him</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, therefore, completely no risk to <span class="SpellE">Rubico's</span> life when he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>,
as compared to the inverse situation as against the deceased whose body was on the
other hand exposed to the peril of <span class="SpellE">Rubico's</span>
knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that it does not appear
that <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span> had even tried to repel the attack by <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>, the more underscores his helplessness or lack of awareness
to the treacherous intrusion of <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

two prosecution witnesses (<span class="SpellE">Penit</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Jr.) testified having seen the deceased still being
attacked by the <span class="SpellE">Sagre</span> brothers after he fell to the

had just turned his back from the dead body 'maybe with the intention to
escape...' (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that while Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Zaragoza</span> rushed to the scene, he was continuously blowing
his whistle (p. 13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <u>supra</u>), and this

defense which attempted to show that, after each of them had stabbed Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, Sr., <span class="SpellE">Rubico</span> immediately
told his brother <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> to surrender to the said
policeman, and they both surrendered (pp. 48-49, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

Ramon <span class="SpellE">Adayon</span>, sr. - and to dispossess them of the
knives they were caught with.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A surrender to be voluntary must be spontaneous, showing the intent
of the accused to submit himself unconditionally to the authorities, either
because he acknowledges his guilt, or because he wishes to save them the
trouble and expense necessarily incurred in his search and capture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a surrender is not voluntary when forced
by circumstances as when escape was impossible under the circumstances (Revised
