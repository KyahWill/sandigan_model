<span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> M. Javier, as administrator of the Estate of

<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Cruz and her children Civil Case No. 5996 to
declare null and void a deed of sale of a part of <span style="">a </span>parcel of land located in Barrio San Isidro, <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> containing an area
of 182,959 square meters and assessed at P4,310.00 under Tax No. 9136 under Tax
No. 9136 in the name of Estate of E. Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amended complaint stated that <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
Cruz, who died on February 2, 1941 at the age of 100 years without leaving any
will nor compulsory heirs, was the absolute and exclusive owner of a parcel of
mountainous and un­improved land situated in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matogalo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> which he inherited from his forebears, described
therein; that during his lifetime,<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz had been living with one <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>
Santos "without the sanction of marriage"; that <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>
Santos had with her as distant relatives and <span class="SpellE">protegees</span>
the brothers Gregorio Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> Cruz; that
Gregorio Cruz was the father of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz, deceased
hus<span style="">b</span>and of defendant <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Cruz and father
of defendants <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span>, Roman, <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Liberata</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melecia</span>, all
surnamed Cruz; that on January 16, 1941 <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz,
by means of deceit and in collusion with persons among them his father Gregorio
Cruz made <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz, who could read and write,
stamp his thumb mark on a deed of sale of a portion of the land described in
the complaint consisting of 26,577 square meters for the sum of P700.00 in
favor of said <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz; that at that time <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz did not have the amount of P700.00 and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz did not receive the said amount; that at the
time <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz was almost dying and as a matter of
fact he died seventeen days after, on February 2, 1941; that the defendant <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Cruz together
with her children co-defendants, taking advantage of the approved plan of the land
in question obtained through the efforts of the plaintiff, acting in absolute
bad faith and relying upon the fraudulent deed of sale, presented an
application in their names for the registration and confirmation of title of
the totality of the said land with an area of 182,959 square meters instead of
only the portion of 26,577 square meters supposedly sold by the late <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz to <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz; and
that the application for registration of title was docketed as Land
Registration Case No. N-2637 of the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer filed on
May 5, 1960 the defendants alleged that <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz
and <span class="SpellE">Isidora</span> Santos were legally married and had lived
together for more than </span>50 <span style="">years;
</span>and that the property described in the complaint was bought by the
spouses <span class="SpellE"><span style="">E</span>usebio</span>
Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Isidora</span> Santos during their marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As affirmative defense, they stated that the
plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> Javier, has no legal capacity to
sue as administrator because all the properties of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
Cruz had been disposed of for consideration by <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span style="">Cruz; </span>that the defendant, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Cruz and her late
husband; <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz, acquired title of the land in
question by way of absolute sale from the spouses <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Isidora</span> Santos; that the said sale was <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> by <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Isidora</span> Santos and<span style=""> </span>acknowledged
before Notary Public <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Valle and was registered
under Act No. 3344 in the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>;

peacefully and adversely against the whole world for more than 18 years since
January 16, 1941.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the undisputed facts of record support the evidence of
the plaintiff that the deed of sale of the land in question is void and
inexistent for lack of consent and consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that on January 17, 1941 when the deed of sale was
executed, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz was almost 100 years old and
was in a weak condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Leonardo Valle, son of the notary public, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Valle, declared that <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz was already very
old and could not answer the question whether the signature on the deed of
sale, Exhibit A, was his signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent portion of the <span style="">testimony </span>of
Leonardo Valle reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My

question?<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz and the latter could not answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz told my father that it was really the signature
of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz so that my father went home to have
the document ratified at home."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz could not talk, was very
ill and was about to die when his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> was
affixed on the deed of sale, Exhibit A.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz did not have any means of
livelihood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was only the houseboy of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that on January 17, 1941 <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
Cruz could not have raised the amount of P700.00 as consideration of the land
supposedly sold to him by <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the deed of sale, Exhibit A, purports to convey a parcel
of land with an area of only 26,577 square meters, defendants, as heirs of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Cruz, claim a much bigger land containing an area of
182,959 square meters assessed at P4,310.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The consideration of P700.00 is not only grossly inadequate but is shocking to
the conscience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sane person would
sell the land claimed by the defendants for only about P40.00 per hectare.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, this Court finds that <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz did not voluntarily affix his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on the deed of sale, Exhibit A, and did not
receive any con­sideration for said sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">No damages can be awarded to the plaintiff for lack of factual
and legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed
and the deed of sale, Exhibit A, is declared null and void and the estate of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz is declared the owner of the land described in
the amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants
are ordered to desist from in any manner disturbing the possession of the
administrator of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Cruz of the
land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to
costs.</p>
