				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to declare null
and void the orders of the Municipal Court of San Fernando, Pampanga, issued in
Criminal Cases Nos. 4203; People vs. Federico Quizon and 4204, People vs.
Profitisa Quizon, dated July 11 and August 17, 1964, respectively, denying
petitioners' motion to quash the criminal complaints against them based on the
ground of pres足cription of the offense of serious oral defamation of which they
were charged, and to prohibit said court from proceeding further with the said
criminal cases, except to dismiss the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 11, 1964, private respondent, Cecilia Sangalang, with the
assistance of Assistant Provincial Fiscal Eliodoro B. Guinto, who had conducted
the preliminary investigation, filed with respondent court two separate
criminal complaints both for serious oral defamation, the one against
petitioner Federico Quizon <span style="">in Criminal
Case No. 4203 and the other petitioner Profitisa Quizon in Criminal Case No. 4204,
committed, according to the said complaints on the same day, November 11,
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being called for arraignment,
petitioners presented a written motion to quash contending principally that the
offense charged had already prescribed as of </span><st1:date month="5" day="9" year="1964"><span style="">May 9, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of their
motion, petitioners argued that by express provision of Article 90 of the
Revised Penal Code, the offense of oral defamation prescribes in six months and
under the authority of People vs. del Rosario, 97 Phil. 67, the correct computation
of said six months for the purposes of their particular case is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From <st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1963">Nov. 12 to 30, 1963</st1:date> there were<span style="">........................... </span> 19 days</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(Page 26, Record.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Overruling their motion, respondent court reasoned out thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"The prosecution
opposed the motion to dismiss by making a computation of time as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"From </span><st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1964"><span style="">Nov. 12 to 30,
 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, there are<span style="">...................... </span> 19 days<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>April<span style="">.......................................................................... </span>
30 days</blockquote>

<blockquote>From <st1:date month="5" day="1" year="1964">May 1 to 11, 1964</st1:date>, there are<span style="">.......................... </span> <u>11 </u>days</blockquote>

<blockquote>From <st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1963">Nov. 12, 1963</st1:date> to <st1:date month="5" day="11" year="1964">May 11, 1964</st1:date> are<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>180 days</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Opposition to the Motion
to Quash, p. 2)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A study of the provisions of the laws pertinent to the issue
at bar leads one to agree with the mode of computation submitted by the public
prosecutor because Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code, in providing for the
prescriptive period for oral defamation, speaks of month, not of day, as the
basic unit in reckoning the duration of the prescription, when it says that
'offenses of oral defamation x x x x shall prescribe in six months.' Article 13
of the new Civil Code says that 'when the laws speak of x x x, months, x x x,
it shall be understood that x x x month x x x of thirty days each x x x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It says further that 'If months are
designated by their name, they shall be com足puted by the number of days which
they respectively have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conformably to
these legal provisions and applying the same to the case at bar, the
computation given by the public prosecutor appears to be correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The month of November was designated in the
com足plaint so it will be given the number of days it has in the calendar which
is 30 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the succeeding months of
December, January, February, March and April, which are the months comprised
within the prescriptive period of six (6) months are nowhere specifically designated
by their name, consequently they should be given the 30-day period of duration
in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 13 aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is believed, and the Court so holds, that
this formula or mode of computation is more squarely in accordance with the one
adopted in the case of People vs. Del Rosario (G. R. No. L-7234) quoted in the
motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The month of May,
having been designated in the complaint, was given the number of 31 days it has
in the calendar, the succeeding month of June comprised within the prescriptive
period was given 30-day duration, so it resulted to be thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote>May 28 to 31<span style="">---------- </span>3 days (the 28th was excluded)</blockquote>

<blockquote>June<span style="">-------------------- </span>30
days</blockquote>

<blockquote>July 27<span style="">----------------- </span><u>27 days<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></u>(the 27th was included)</blockquote>

<blockquote>60 days</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In pursuance thereto, the Supreme Court in the Del Rosario
Case finally held that the filing of the action on July 27 was on the 60th day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the formula for computation of the defense is to be
followed, Article 13 in so far as a month is to be understood to be of 30 days,
unless the month is designated by its name, will be rendered nugatory, for the
simple reason that there are months that have 31 days in the calendar to be
reckoned with as they will be within the prescriptive period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic unit of computation used by the
defense is by the day and not by the month of 30-day duration as provided for
in Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code, the counting of which is to be made in
relation to Article 13 of the Civil Code (new).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention of the private prosecutor no longer needs
discussion in view of the con足clusion arrived at above." (Pp. 37-40,
Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Surely, such ratiocination is plainly erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of People vs. del Rosario, supra,
which was properly brought to the attention of the court in petitioners' motion
to quash, this Court held very clearly that:</p>

<blockquote>"The pertinent provisions of Articles 90 and 91 of the Revised
Penal Code are as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">'Art. 90.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Prescription of crimes</u>. - * * *.</p>

<p class="2Q">The offenses of oral defamation and slander by deed shall prescribe
in six months.</p>

<p class="2Q">Light offenses prescribe in two months.'</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.4in; text-indent: 0.2in;">'Art. 91.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Computation of prescription of offenses</u>.
?</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.0001pt;">The period of prescription shall
commence to run from the day on which the crime is dis足covered by the offended
party, the authorities or their agents, * * *.'</p>

<blockquote>"The court <u>a quo</u> held that in accordance with Article 13
of the new Civil Code the 'month' mentioned in Article 90 of the Revised Penal
Code should be one of 30 days, and since the period of prescription com足mences
to run from the day 'on which the crime is discovered by the offended party,'
i.e., in this case on May 28, 1953 when it was committed, the two months period
provided for the prescription of the offense already expired when the
information was filed, because the filing was on the 61st day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General in this appeal argues
that in the same manner that Article 13 of the new Civil Code is applied to
determine the length of the two months period required for the prescription of
the offense, its provision (of the said Article 13) contained in paragraph 3
which reads 'In computing a period, the first day shall be excluded, and the
last day included' should also be applied, so that the information should be
con足sidered as filed on the 60th day and not on the 61st day after the offense
has been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of
the appeal involves the determination of two legal issues, first, whether the
prescriptive period should commence from the very day on which the crime was
committed, or from the day following that in which it was com足mitted, in
accordance with the third paragraph of Article 13 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines, and second, whether the term 'month' in the Revised Penal Code
should be understood to be a month of 30 days, instead of the civil or calendar
month.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the first question, we note that Article 91 of the
Revised Penal Code provides that the period shall commence to run from the day
on which the offense is committed or discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The title indicates that the provision merely
purports to prescribe the manner of computing the period of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the computation of a period of time within
which an act is to be done, the law in this jurisdiction has always directed
the first day be excluded and the last included (See section 1, Rule 28 of the
Rules of Court; section 13, Rev. Adm. Code and Art. 13, Civil Code of the
Philippines).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the case of Surbano
vs. Gloria, 51 Phil., 415, where the question involved was whether an offense
had prescribed, we held that from February 18 to <st1:date month="3" day="15" year="1927">March 15, 1927</st1:date> only a period of 25 days elapsed, because
we excluded the first day (February 18) and included the last day (March
15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above method of computation was
in force in this juris足diction even before the advent of the American regime
(Article 7, Spanish Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
logical to presume, therefore, that the Legislature in enacting Article 91 of
the Revised Penal Code meant or intended to mean that in the computation of the
period provided for therein, the first day is to be excluded and the last one
included, in accord with existing laws.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We find much sense in the argument of the Solicitor General
that if the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip足pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is to be resorted to in the interpretation of the length of the month, so
should it be resorted to in the computation of the period of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, Article 18 of the Civil Code
(Article 16 of the old Civil Code) expressly directs that any deficiency in any
special law (such as the Revised Penal Code) must be supplied by its
provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Revised Penal Code is
deficient in that it does not explicitly define how the period is to be
computed, resort must be had to its Article 13, which contains in detail the
manner of computing a period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find,
therefore, that the trial court committed error in not excluding the first day
in the computation of the period of prescription of the offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The other question is whether a month mentioned in Article 90
should be considered as the calendar month and not the 30-day month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that no provision of the
Revised Penal Code defines the length of the month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 7 of the old Civil Code provided that
a month shall be understood as containing 30 days; but this concept was
modified by section 13 of the Revised Adminis足trative Code which provides that
a month means the civil or calendar month and not the regular 30-day month
(Gutierrez vs. Carpio, 53 Phil., 334).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the approval of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(R. A. No. 386), however, we have reverted to the provisions of the Spanish
Civil Code in accordance with which a month is to be considered as the regular 30-day
month (Article 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision of
the new Civil Code has been intended for general application in the
interpretation of the laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
offense charged in the information in the case at bar took place on <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1953">May 28, 1953</st1:date>, after the new Civil
Code had come into effect, this new provision should apply, and in accordance
therewith the month in Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code should be
understood to mean the regular 30-day month.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In our conclusion that the term 'month' used in the Revised
Penal Code should be interpreted in the sense that the new Civil Code defines
the said term, we find persuasive authority in a decision of the Supreme Court
of Spain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case decided by it in the
year 1887 (S. de 30 de Marzo de 1887), prior to the approval of the Civil Code
of Spain, it had declared that when the law spoke of months, it meant the
natural month or the solar month, in the absence of express provisions to the
contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But after the promulgation of
the Civil Code of Spain, which provided in its Article 7 a general rule for the
interpretation of the laws, and with particular respect to months, that a month
shall be understood as a 30-day month, said court held that the two months
period for the prescription of a light offense should be understood to mean 60
days, a month being a 30-day month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(S.
de 6 de Abril de 1895, 3 Viada, p. 45).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, we hold that in view of the express provisions of Article 13
of the new Civil Code the term 'month' used in Article 90 of the Revised Penal
Code should be understood to mean the 30-day month and not the solar or civil
month.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We hold, therefore, that the offense charged in the
information prescribed in 60 days, said period to be counted by excluding May
28, the commission of the offense, and we find that when the information was
filed on <st1:date month="7" day="27" year="1953">July 27, 1953</st1:date> the
offense had not yet prescribed because July 27 is the sixtieth day from May
29." (97 Phil., pp. 68-72.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing pronouncements of this Court, the
insistence of respondents that the factual situation in this case is
substantially different from the one in del Rosario is too tenuous to merit
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents have not
shown any ponderous reason why We have to depart from the above rulings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it being obvious that respondent court disregarded the
construction of the pertinent legal provisions by this Court, the charge of
petitioners that it has committed grave abuse of discretion must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the contention of respondents that the denial of a motion
to quash is not a ground for <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition, suffice it to
state that to allow an accused to undergo the ordeals of trial and conviction
when the information or complaint against him is patently defective or the
offense charged therein has been indisputably shown to have already prescribed
is unfair and unjust, for which reason, procedurally, the ordinary remedy of
appeal cannot be plain and adequate.</p>
