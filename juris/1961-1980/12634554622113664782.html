				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On November 3, 1958 <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> San Diego
instituted <u>certiorari</u> proceedings in the Court of First Instance of
Manila to set aside a decision of the Iloilo Regional Of­fice (No. 5) of the
Department of Labor, ordering him to pay P2,350 to <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bieles</span> as compensation for the death of her husband
who was, at the time of his death, in the employ of San Diego as radio
operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span>
of the action is that Reorganization Plan 20-A, which gave regional offices of
the Department of Labor jurisdiction to try and decide workmen's compensation
claims, was un­constitutional because it was not passed in the manner
prescribed for the enactment of statutes and because it diminished the
jurisdiction of courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 24, 1959 the court issued a writ of preliminary
injunction directing the respondents Salvador R. <span class="SpellE">Villagracia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span>, labor
administrator and hear­ing officer, respectively, of the Regional Office 5 in
Ilo­ilo, and "[their] attorneys, representatives, agents, and any other person
assisting [them], to refrain from proceed­ing and subsequently issuing a writ
of execution in WCC Case No. 1319."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that at the time the petition for <u>certiorari</u>
was filed, WCC case 1319 had left the regional office, having been elevated on
September 19, 1958 to the Workmen's Compensation Commission in Manila for
review, in view of the filing by the petitioner San Diego of a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore became
necessary for the latter to amend his petition so as to include the chairman
and the associate commissioners of the WCC as party respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This he did on August 27, 1959, but it was
not until February 1, 1960 that the amended petition was admitted by the court
because the petitioner himself filed a motion for the admission of the amended
pleading only on January 27, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the meantime, the WCC proceeded with the review of WCC case 1319, decided it,
and on January 22, 1960, through its secretary, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> Santos, is­sued a writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 20, 1960 the petitioner asked the court to cite Agustin T.
<span class="SpellE">Misola</span> and Jesus M. <span class="SpellE">Naciongayo</span>,
attorneys for the claimant <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bieles</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> Santos,
secretary of the WCC, for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed that</p>

<blockquote>"a) Atty.
Agustin T. <span class="SpellE">Misola</span> sought, and obtained in said WCC
Case No. 1319 a writ of execution; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Jesus M. <span class="SpellE">Naciongayo</span>,
to implement said writ of execution in WCC Case No. 1319 so obtained, as above
indicated, sought and obtained in said WCC Case No. 1319 an order directing the
Philippine Trust Company, Manila, to deliver to the Sheriff of Manila as it did
deliver - P1,021.48 out of petitioner's savings account with said bank; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) the
respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> Santos knowingly and <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> in violation of, and in disobedience to, the
aforesaid writ of prelimi­nary injunction, and in disregard thereto, aided and
abetted the other respondents in proceeding, and subsequently obtaining - he
issued the writ of execution and implementing said writ of execution in said
WCC Case No. 1319."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, <span class="SpellE">Misola</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naciongayo</span> averred that it was the WCC which actually
issued the writ of execution and that what they did was nothing but
"routine." For his part the respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
claimed that he was not a party enjoined by the court and that, as a matter of
fact, the amend­ed petition (including the WCC commissioner as party res­pondents)
was admitted by the court only on <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1960</st1:date>, nine days after the issuance of the writ of execution in
WCC case 1319.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court found the explanation unsatisfactory and sen­tenced
each of the three respondents-appellants to pay a fine of P50, but, on motion
of the latter, the court recon­sidered its order and set the matter for hearing
on August 30, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, as <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, did not appear on the day of the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless the respondents were heard and
afterwards were again found guilty of contempt and, as before, were sentenced
to pay a fine of P50 each.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of section 3 of Rule 64 of the old Rules
of Court (now section 3 of Rule 71) read:</p>

<blockquote>"After charge in writing has been filed, and an opportunity
given to the accused to be heard by himself or counsel, a person guilty of any of
the following acts may be punished for contempt:</blockquote>

<blockquote>". . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)
Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, judgment, or
command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or judge."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The two requisites of this species of indirect contempt are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>first</u>, that the writ be lawful and, <u>second</u>,
that the disobedience be willful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither of these requisite is pre­sent in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have
stated in the beginning, the petitioner filed his action in 1958 on the theory
that the Regional Office 5 of the Department of Labor did not have jurisdiction
of WCC case 1319 because Reorganization Plan 20-A was unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was since been held, however, that Plan
20-A is not unconsti­tutional insofar as it gives labor regional offices jurisdiction
over workmen's compensation claims.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This must be the reason why the petitioner did not press his action for <u>certiorari</u>
which was finally dismissed for non-suit on June 13, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as the law now stands, original and exclusive jurisdiction
over workmen's compensation claims belongs to labor regional offices from whose
decisions appeals may be taken to the WCC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of a member of the WCC is in turn <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the WCC <u>in</u> <u>banc</u> which is composed of three members "who .
. . have the same qualifications as those of judges of the court of first
instance."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The decisions of the WCC are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the
Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Court of first instance cannot review, much less annul, the decision of the
WCC.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The result is that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by
the lower court was a nullity which could not be forced, let alone made the
basis of contempt proceedings, against the WCC, its officials and other persons
assisting them, such as the respondents <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Misola</span> and <span class="SpellE">Naciongayo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it said in the appealed order:</p>

<blockquote>"Even admitting, for the sake of
argument, that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition for
certiorari filed in this case, it is not the respondent who should decide the
question of juris­diction or validity of the orders of this court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as the case is still with this court,
the orders issued therein are presumed to be lawful and anybody who willfully
disregards the same is guilty of contempt of court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not seem to be bothered by the
fundamental difference between an injunction which, though erroneous, is issued
by a court of competent jurisdiction and one which, though correct, is issued
by a court which does not have jurisdiction to issue the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is valid and should be obeyed the
second is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The injunction issued in this case is of the second type.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court's injunction was directed only against Salvador R. <span class="SpellE">Villagracia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> of Re­gional
Office 5, and their "attorneys, representatives, agents and any other
person assisting [them]." But as we have noted earlier, the action was
erroneously brought against the officials of the Regional Office 5 in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
because by then the case had been elevated to the WCC in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner himself
attached to his petition for <u>certiorari</u> (as annex K) a copy of the
regional office order dated <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1958</st1:date> forwarding the case to the WCC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously he realized his mistake; that is
why on <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1959</st1:date> he
filed an amended petition, but it was not until <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1960</st1:date> that he moved for the admission of his
amended petition and only because the WCC had earlier (January 22) issued a
writ of execution in WCC case 1319.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner thus gambled with his chances on review by the WCC, and it was only
when an adverse judgment was rendered against him and it was exe­cuted<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a>
that he asked the court to admit his amended petition so that he might have a
basis for a contempt charge against the new respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even after the amended petition was
finally admitted on <st1:date year="1960" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1960</st1:date>,
that is, nine days after the writ of execution was issued, no corresponding
amendment of the writ of preliminary injunction was made so as to bring within
the sphere of its prohibition the WCC and its officials and any person aiding
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Willfulness implies knowledge of the existence of the order and
its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, one
who is not a party to an action is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court
trying the case and cannot reasonably be supposed to be aware of the court's
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he cannot be
declared guilty of contempt for violation of the order.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
cannot be punished for what he did before the WCC was made a party to the
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, he cannot be
punished for doing a duty enjoined upon him by law, absent a restraining or
injunctive order against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
self-evident, and this the court failed to take into account.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order appealed from reversed and set
aside, and the respondents-appellant are hereby absolved, at petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> cost.</p>
