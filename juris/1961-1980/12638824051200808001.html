respect our country accords to its female population.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any departure from such a norm would be a
betrayal of a deep-seated national tradition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, it cannot be lost sight of that an offense of this
character, while "most detestable," according to Blackstone,"

is an accusation easy to be made, hard to be proved, but harder to be defended

When, therefore, the Acting Solicitor General Vicente V.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mendoza,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
instead of filing a brief for <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, submitted a
Manifestation recommending "that the judgment of the lower court"
finding appellant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span> guilty of abduction
with rape and sentencing him to the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> "be reversed" and another be
entered acquitting him,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the need for a thorough study of the record became evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful scrutiny thereof leads us to the
conclusion that the guilt of appellant had not been shown beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision cannot be
sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Manifestation of Acting Solicitor General Vicente V.
Mendoza, he narrated the facts which in his view were entitled to
credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started with the statement
that it was in a chance encounter between complainant, Virginia Salazar de la
Cruz, and appellant while they were passengers in a <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span>
Transit bus, both of them being residents thereof and bound for <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Jose</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, that led to the
train of events culminating in the accusation against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was quite friendly; as a matter of fact
she "was leaning on him."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus encouraged, he asked her whether "he could visit her in her
house." She answered in the negative, but quickly added that they could
"just see each other in the public market of <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Jose</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After two days, they did meet in such a place, with the appellant losing no
time to invite her to his house, after noticing that she was quite receptive to
his advances.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
They proceeded on a tricycle to his house, and on arrival, appellant
"introduced [her] to his parents and told them that she will be their
daughter-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She kissed the hands of
his parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stayed in his house the
whole day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After taking their lunch, the
accused lay with the complainant, and they had sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon she left his house and went home."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After that day, it was not unexpected for such intimacies to be repeated, with
complainant not only visiting appellant but also bringing "coffee, native
cakes and rice whenever she went to his house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each time she came they had sexual intercourse."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Manifestation continues the narrative thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"One day, in May, 1973, the accused was
eating in the public market with his friend Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>
and the complainant Virginia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
stood up and left them because she saw her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following morning, when Rogelio went to
visit his brother-in-law, who is a neighbor of the complainant in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Abar</span> 1st, he saw <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
with contusions and a swollen face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asked his brother-in-law what had happened, and was told that complainant's
husband had beaten her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in the
month of May, 1973, the complainant and the accused seldom saw each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant told the accused that she
could not see him often because her husband arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also told him that if she wanted to meet
him, she would just write him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complainant in fact wrote the accused two letters, both of which she sent
through Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She signed the letters with the numbers 8 and
7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The figure 8 referred to the name <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>,
which has 8 letters and 7 referred to the name Salazar, which has 7
letters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wrote the letters in the
house of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> and Rogelio saw her write
these letters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same occasion, the
complainant informed Rogelio that she was being restricted in their house by
her husband and she was afraid the accused Antonio might get angry with
her."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, according to the Manifestation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The complainant had earlier introduced
herself to the accused as a widow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio did not know that <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
was in fact married, until sometime during the first week of May, 1973 when
they were eating at the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he learned that she was married, he told her to avoid him, but she answered
that she could not, because she loved him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio did not also try to avoid her because he loved her, even if he
already knew that she was married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio's
parents also learned about the fact that the complainant was married and they
strongly objected to their relationship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio's mother actually confronted <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
about this, and <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state> answered
that she will rise from where she fell.' She explained that she is separated
from her husband and that he already has another wife in <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appeared that she was predisposed to continue the
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For three days and three
nights after <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1973</st1:date>,
complainant stayed in the house of the parents of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of their love for "each other,
and [because they] were afraid that people may have already seen them together,
they went to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From Barrio <span class="SpellE">Isla</span>,
they went to <span class="SpellE">Balivag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
and there stayed in the house of an old couple for more than a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> the accused and the complainant went to <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and stayed in the
house of a relative of the accused, Doc <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span>, at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> Blvd.</st1:address></st1:street><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stayed there for three nights and each
night, the accused had sexual intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the mother of Doc <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span>
took them to her house in Barrio <st1:country-region><st1:place>Armenia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Talac</span>, where they
stayed for more than a week."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">Then the Manifestation proceeded to explain why notwithstanding
these antecedent facts, appellant was prosecuted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "They were still in Barrio <st1:country-region><st1:place>Armenia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
during the referendum on <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that day, the relatives of the accused
went to the house where the accused and the complainant were staying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They invited the complainant to go out and
vote with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went with them to
the polling place which was located near the P. C. Detachment post in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Armenia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived there, a P. C. soldier,
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daton</span>, stopped them because he noticed that they
were new in the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daton</span> asked <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
where she was from, and why she happened to be in Barrio <st1:country-region><st1:place>Armenia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She answered that she was from <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Jose</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, and pointed to
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span> as her companion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The P. C. Officer asked her whether Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span> was her husband, and she answered in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the P. C. advised
the complainant together with Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span> and
their other companions, to go to the headquarters at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Macabulos</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived at the P. C. Headquarters, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
was asked who her husband was, and she answered that her husband is Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> de la Cruz, an army man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then when the P. C. soldiers became
interested in asking her why she was in <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant answered that she was brought
there by the accused and that Antonio abducted and raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
the accused Antonio was detained in jail, by virtue of the complaint brought by
<st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state> against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was in jail, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
visited him and brought him cigarettes and <span class="SpellE"><u>tupig</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She apologized to him and told him that she
did not want what had happened to him, but she had to do it because she was
afraid of her husband."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the basis of a careful and thorough evaluation of the
evidence, certainly much more detailed and much more analytical than the
narration of less than two pages in the brief submitted for appellant, that
Acting Solicitor General Vicente V. Mendoza was led to conclude that the
conviction must be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With that
conclusion, as set forth at the outset, we<i> </i>are in agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant must be acquitted.</p>

<blockquote>1. It is certainly worth stating that the Office of the Solicitor
General equally took pains to scrutinize rigorously the evidence for the
complainant, a lady in her early thirties, hardly an unsophisticated person in
the first bloom of youth, a married woman at that. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As noted in the aforesaid Manifestation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After a careful perusal of the case,
the undersigned respectfully submit that the evidence presented by the
prosecution falls short of the required standard of sufficiency to hold the
accused guilty of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several circumstances argue against the credibility of Virginia Salazar
de la Cruz, as well as the probability of her story."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this appraisal of what was testified to by the complainant regarding
the alleged abduction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
complainant alleges that on <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="7">July 3,
 1973</st1:date> the accused, whom the complainant had never met before,
suddenly grabbed her while she was in the public market of <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Jose</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and
forced her to board a tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
took her to the house of his parents where he ravished her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The abduction occurred in broad daylight, or
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The improbability of the complainant's charge
is immediately visible from the time and locus where the crime was supposed to
have been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public market
is hardly the place, for a person intending to commit abduction, to pick as the
place to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially
so, at 10:00 in the morning, as in this case, when the market place was at its
busiest and the smallest incident could easily cause a commotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore unusual that no one noticed
the complainant when she was allegedly abducted, despite her claim that she
struggled and vigorously resisted the accused, and her niece, Victoria <span class="SpellE">Bengaño</span>, supposedly cried for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant claims she was then inside
the market place, and the tricycle where she was boarded was parked on the road
<u>outside</u> the market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means
that the accused must have pulled the complainant to the tricycle for some
distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is notable that the
complainant <u>did not shout</u>, when the accused pulled her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a policeman stationed near the
market, but she did not call for his help.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant claims her mouth was covered by the accused when the
accused grabbed her, so she was not able to shout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the complainant's niece was with her and
she claims that she saw the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why then did the complainant's niece not immediately report the incident
to the authorities, or seek the help of the many people in the market?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant herself admits there were
many people in the market during the incident in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the complainant struggled as hard as she
claims she did, surely, there must have been someone who must have noticed the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, there is no evidence of
anyone at all who noticed or reported the incident to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any claim that the accused was
armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant states that she
was shoved into the tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
complainant was struggling, then the tricycle driver must have seen her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, he did not do anything to help her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he unquestioningly took the accused
and the complainant to the house of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the complainant's version is to be
believed, then the tricycle driver must also be guilty of having aided the
accused to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, yet,
the complainant does not charge that he was in conspiracy with the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house of the accused in
Santo <span class="SpellE">Niño</span> 1st, <st1:place><st1:placename>San Jose</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> was some distance away from
the public market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The road leading to
the house of the accused passed through a bus station, a bridge where a
policeman directs traffic, and several houses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact the house of the accused was in a squatter's area and the
complainant admits that there were many neighbors and it was a crowded
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the complainant had all
the opportunity to cry for help and many would have to come to her assistance
if she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she did not ask for
help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they reached the house of the
accused, the complainant met the father of the accused sitting on the stairs of
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, she could have asked
for his help, but she did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
without her shouting, the mere sight of her struggling to be free, and
resisting the accused, would have been enough to lead the father of the accused
to intervene and suspect that his son had done something wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the complainant would have this
Honorable Court believe that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> father
merely looked on them, and did not do anything under the circumstances and that
he was afraid of the accused, his own son, so he allowed and tolerated him to
commit a crime in his presence and in their house, without question."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Manifestation then proceeded to affirm categorically:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The incidents which followed after that
according to the complainant herself, are equally incredible."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It explained why it could employ that tone of certainty:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The complainant contends that when they
arrived at the house of the accused, the latter started boxing her for no
apparent reason, so that she was rendered unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when she woke up, it was already
dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the time the accused <u>asked</u>
her to have sexual intercourse with him and they had sexual intercourse <u>for
the first time</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why would the accused abduct
the complainant in broad daylight, render her unconscious, wait for her to
regain consciousness, and then ask her permission to have sexual intercourse
with her! * * * The complainant's version is clearly illogical and
improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several other incidents show
that the complainant's claim that she was constantly in fear of the accused so
she submitted to sexual intercourse with him, is without basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances which she described as
accompanying her trip to <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City, then to <span class="SpellE">Baliuag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, then to San
Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and finally to Barrio Armenia, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, show that the
complainant was <u>free</u> from restraint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence that she was subjected to constant threats or that
violence was inflicted upon her by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the bus trip to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the mother of the accused was
with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant and mother of
the accused was seated at the <u>back</u> of the bus, while the accused was
near the driver. * * * The accused introduced her to his cousins and other
relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also met the friends of
the accused to whom she was introduced by the accused as his wife, and to which
the complainant did not object.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
also introduced by the accused to her parents as their future
daughter-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, on Referendum
Day, the complainant was even invited by the cousins of the accused to go out
and vote with them which she accepted without any restraint from the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted in the defense brief,
she did not voluntarily report the incident charged to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she went out on Referendum Day, it was
not her intention to complain to the authorities that the accused had abducted
and raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to the polling
place to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the authorities,
noting that she was a stranger in the palace, asked her where she was from, who
her husband was, and why she was in Bo. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Armenia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> on
Referendum Day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only then after
she was questioned by the authorities that in panic she charged Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quiazon</span> of having abducted and raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the circumstances show that if she
had not been questioned thus by the authorities she would not have charged the
accused with abduction and rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
notable that no medical certificate was offered in evidence to support the
complainant's charge of 'force and intimidation' accompanying her sexual intercourse
with the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, she
did not deny that she visited the accused and brought him cigarettes and <span class="SpellE"><u>tupig</u></span>, when he was detained in jail in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the Manifestation would reiterate the lack of persuasiveness
of complainant's version:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
totality of her testimony is clearly not in accord with the natural run of
events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is the testimony of the
complainant incredible, but she herself, is not a credible witness."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>2. It is precisely because of such notorious lack of any persuasive
force in the testimony of complainant that the Manifestation asserted most
emphatically that appellant could rely on the constitutional presumption of

<blockquote>3. The accusation that appellant committed abduction with rape is
thus devoid of any factual foundation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The teaching of applicable decisions is definitely to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only by a deviation from what has been so
long and so consistently held by this Court can the lower court decision
finding appellant guilty be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There would be no justification for such a move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be an affront to reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can truly be said that words have lost
their meaning if the facts duly established can be characterized as
constituting forcible abduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
element of consent was always present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With complainant's complaisant attitude, not to say enthusiastic
cooperation, coercion was definitely unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the leading cases starting from <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

complainant and the offender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seldom, if
ever, is there an eyewitness to the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, conviction or acquittal of
the accused depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore for a good
reason that courts examine with the greatest care the complainant's story and
subject it to a thorough scrutiny to determine its veracity in the light of
human nature and experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tested by
these standards, we find valid reasons to reject <span class="SpellE">Benilda</span>

can be said of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that carnal acts did
take place but only under circumstances of mutual consent and, considering
their having been repeated on several occasions, in all probability, of mutual
gratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever moral
disapprobation may be visited on the mode of conduct of the accused cannot
justify a conviction under this indictment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The practices he did engage in could not be held subject to the
liability sought to be imposed upon him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is entitled to an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp;
