				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In January, 1965, Fernando E. <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>
agreed to purchase on installment from S. L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
Inc. of <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, an <st1:city><st1:place>Austin</st1:place></st1:city>
1100 De <span class="SpellE">Luxe</span> Saloon, for P12<span class="GramE">,465.30</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale was negotiated by Tomas <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, a company agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>
at <span style="">his </span>residence at Sta. Rita, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1965</st1:date>, to cover the down
payment of P3<span class="GramE">,133.00</span>, Lydia P. <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>,
wife of Fernando E. <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>, issued a PNCB Check C-86958-M,
postdated <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cesar Ma. <span class="SpellE">Ocam­po</span>,
manager of S.L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Inc., rejected that check,
for it trenches upon company policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>
<span class="GramE">returned</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He requested that the check
be made current.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Lydia P. <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span> erased the date "March 31", superimposed
the date "January 23".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
signed her name on top of the corrected date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">On January 26 following, the company presented the
check for payment.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank, the Philippine National Cooperative Bank,
dishonored said check with the notation "Not arranged for".</p>

<p class="BODY">It was then that S.L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Inc.
referred the matter to its legal counsel, respondent Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1965</st1:date>, respondent wrote
petitioner Fernando E. <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>, re­questing the
latter to redeem the check in three (3) days; other­wise, criminal action would
be filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By letter of <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1965</st1:date>, petitioner
replied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there alleged that the
agreement bet­ween him and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> was that
the check was not to be cashed or negotiated until <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Manager <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> de­nied <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan's</span>
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent obtained <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan's</span> affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He advised the company that an <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>
case could be filed against the <span class="SpellE">Ricaforts</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, informed the company that he
could not handle the case because the judge of the Munici­pal Court of San
Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, is his father, Jose <span class="SpellE">Balta­zar</span>, Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 23, 1965, a criminal complaint for <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> was filed against <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>
and his wife in the Municipal Court of San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
by Pedro T. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, assistant manager of S.L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
this case, the company retained the services of Atty. N.B.S. Navarro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date that the complaint was
filed, Judge Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Sr. conducted a pre­liminary
investigation, ordered the arrest of the couple, fixed their bail at P2<span class="GramE">,000</span> each, and directed the transmittal of the re­cord to
the provincial fiscal for the filing of the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1965</st1:date>,
S.L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Inc., through Atty. Na­varro, petitioned
for a writ of attachment in the criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ground relied upon is that the accused "have concealed, re­moved,
or disposed of their personal property or they are about to do so".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>,
Sr. granted the petition on March 10, upon a P12<span class="GramE">,465.30</span>
-bond posted by the Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of this writ, the <st1:city><st1:place>Austin</st1:place></st1:city>
car was seized from the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Ricaforts</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1965</st1:date>,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lalin</span>, counsel
of the <span class="SpellE">Ricaforts</span>, requested the fiscal for a
reinvestigation of the <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reinvestigation was had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March
 24, 1966</st1:date>, Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Regidor</span> <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span> and Special Counsel Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>
lodged with the municipal court a motion to dismiss the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is
that the "evidence on hand is insufficient to establish even a probable
cause against the accused much less prove their guilt beyond reasonable
doubt".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1966</st1:date>, this motion was denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing in
their effort to secure <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Ricaforts</span> went to the Court of Appeals [CA-G.R. No.
38091-R] for certiorari, mandamus and prohibition, with a prayer for
preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1966</st1:date>, the Court of
Appeals issued a temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This case is pending decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Offshoot of the foregoing were the twin moves of the <span class="SpellE">Ricaforts</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>an
administrative charge against Judge Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>,
Sr.; and the present disbarment proceeding against the latter's son, Atty. Jose
G. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr., on grounds of malpractice, gross
misconduct and harassment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case against Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Sr.
was investigated by Judge <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> Romero, executive
judge of the Fifth Judicial District.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that case, Judge Romero recommended exoneration of Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Undersecretary of Justice approved the
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We referred to the Solicitor General the petition for disbar­ment
against Atty. Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearings were con­ducted by Assistant
Solicitor-General <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="4">April
 18, 1967</st1:date>, the Solicitor General submitted his report, recommended
that respondent Atty. Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr. be
exonerated.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons following, the Solicitor General's recom­mendation
should be sustained:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>, respondent did not right away file an <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> charge against complainant and his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He requested them first to make good the
check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This act belies harassment,
malpractice or misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
couple's failure to do so, it was but natural for respondent to counsel his
client to take steps to pro­tect the latter's interests.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>, the fact that respondent caused to be typewritten
the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, should not be taken
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1965</st1:date>, when that affidavit was
prepared, respondent had already received from complainant the letter of
February 11, stating that he [complainant] had an agreement with <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> that the check was not to be cashed or
negotiated until <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became respondent's duty to inquire about
the truth from <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result was <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan's</span>
affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this affidavit, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> stated that the agreement between him and the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span> was that the car would be delivered
upon a down payment of P3<span class="GramE">,133.00</span>; that he agreed to
accept the check "considering that they looked to be respectable",
and that they delivered the check without informing him that they had no funds
to cover the amount thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts
stated in the affidavit are <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record would show that those
facts are of respondent's making.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>, neither is there proof of persecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>
case was lodged in the court of Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Sr. -
not by re­spondent but by another attorney, N.B.S. Navarro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence does not show that respondent
influenced his father, the Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the Judge was exonerated from the administrative charges against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fourth</u>, with reference to the bond to procure a writ of
attach­ment, it is true that Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Co. Inc. was black­listed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent signed that bond as agency manager
of the surety company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he explained
that at the time he signed the bond, he had no knowledge that it was
blacklisted; and that promptly, upon learning of that fact, he advised his
client, S.L. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, Inc. to change the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the record, we vote to dismiss the complaint for malpractice
against respondent and to exonerate him from the charges.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
