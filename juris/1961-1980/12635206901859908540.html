				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The alleged disregard of the statutory requirement under Section
23 of the Civil Service Act that in case of a vacancy occurring "in any
position in the competitive service in the government or in any
government-owned or controlled corporation or entity, the officer or employee
next in rank preferably in the same office, who is competent and qualified to
hold the position"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
should be appointed thereto, was the basis of an action for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>, prohibition and mandamus which was
dismissed by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
appeal, petitioner Pedro V. Aguilar would insist on his claim to the contested
position of Auditor of the Development Bank of the Philippines on the above
provision, stressing what he deemed were his superior qualifications, bolstered
by seniority, ignoring that respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>,
Jr., the choice of respondent Auditor General, had had experience as Assistant
Auditor for almost ten years in said Bank with a consistent efficiency rating
of not less than 90 percent and that he had discharged the function of Auditor
in such office in an acting capacity during the absence of the incumbent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In petitioner's brief as appellant, he would
impress on this Court that the appointing power, in the light of the above
statutory requirement, was well-nigh bereft of discretion, this notwithstanding
that respondent Auditor General is a constitutional official and the vacancy
did occur in a position of responsibility, requiring the exercise of judgment
in which previous experience and training were certainly helpful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner's stand is opposed to
the principle hitherto followed in past decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>,
prohibition and mandamus with preliminary injunction was filed on May 17, 1965,
the prayer being for a revocation of the designation by respondent Auditor
General of respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, Jr. as acting
Auditor of the Development Bank of the Philippines and the withdrawal of the
appointment issued in his favor dated May 15, 1965 as well as for a declaration
that petitioner was the person legally entitled to hold such office of Auditor
in said bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, a decision
was rendered by the lower court on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="10">October
 3, 1967</st1:date> dismissing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision now on appeal, the facts bearing on the respective
qualifications of petitioner and respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>,
Jr. were set out in some detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
what was said of petitioner:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Petitioner was Auditor and Representative of the Auditor General
in the Philippine Veterans Bank, he having been appointed on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1964</st1:date>, [and thereafter]
qualified [as such].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was receiving a
compensation at the rate of P18<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> per annum and
allowances and privileges allowed or authorized by Republic Act No. 2260.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lately, he was appointed Auditor of the National
Waterworks &amp; Sewerage Authority and assumed the office."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The antecedents of the case were set forth thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On April 23, 1965, he wrote a letter to
the Auditor General reiterating his 'often repeated request' for him 'to
favorably consider him (petitioner) for the prospective vacancy of Auditor' of
respondent Development Bank of the Philip­pines upon the retirement of then
incumbent Isidro <span class="SpellE">Bunag</span> on May 14, 1965, when he would
reach the compulsory retire­ment age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
May 3, 1965, petitioner wrote a letter to respondent Commissioner of Civil
Service, stating, among other things, that 'there is a strong possibility that
in filling this position (that of Auditor of DBP), the Auditor General may
abuse the time honored principles of seniority, merit and other factors, as
rumors are going around that Mr. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, who is
one of the assistant auditors of the DBP, is the probable appointee for the
position.' He asked respondent Commissioner of Civil Service to consider his
said letter as a protest against the appointment of respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1965</st1:date>, the Auditor General
issued Office Order No. 33691, designating respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>,
Jr., as Acting Auditor of respondent Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
effective <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1965</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At that time, respondent was Assistant Auditor of the Development
Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1965</st1:date>, he was given a permanent appointment to such
a position, the previous incumbent having retired the day previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition came two days thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision likewise noted the
qualifications of respondent <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, Jr. thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Respondent Auditor General alleges as
special and affirmative defenses, among other things, that in designating
respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, Jr., as acting Auditor the
following were taken into consideration, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) he was the Assistant Auditor next in rank
to the Auditor of the respondent Bank; (b) he had been Assistant Auditor of the
respondent Bank for almost ten years, with a consistent efficiency rating of
not less than 90%; (c) as such Assistant Auditor of the respondent Bank for
that length of time, he was familiar and well-versed with the workings of the
Auditing Department; (d) for sometime before he had discharged the function of
Auditor in an acting capacity in the absence of the incumbent; and (e) he had
been in the service of the Govern­ment since 1933 with an unblemished record;
that the Auditor of the respondent Bank, like all other Auditors of government
corporations and entities, is in truth and in fact merely the representative of
the Auditor General between whom fiduciary relation exists, characterized by
the highest degree of mutual trust and confidence, so much so that the Auditor
General himself may validly assume the duties of Auditor of the respondent
Bank; that accordingly, should the answering respondent choose to appoint a
representative, it is but fair and just that he be conceded a reasonable degree
of latitude and discretion in selecting the man of his confidence who, for
obvious reasons, may be the respondent <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span> who is
the Assistant Auditor next in rank to the Auditor of the respondent Bank; * *
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was not entirely <span class="GramE">unexpected,</span>
therefore, that petitioner would be at the losing end, although the decision
appeared to have been based more on procedural deficiencies, including the
failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this appeal, petitioner is even more insistent in his claim that he
ought to have been the choice for the contested position of Auditor under a
mechanistic view of the aforesaid statutory provision, the decisive factors to
be taken into account, according to him, being his seniority in the service
which started in 1923, ten years earlier than that of respondent <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, Jr. as well as his having worked as auditor as far
back as 1938 unlike respondent <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, Jr., who
started performing such functions only in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even then, there is not enough to justify a reversal of the decision on
appeal, especially so if account be taken, as mentioned in the opening paragraph
of this opinion, of the doctrines thus far handed down by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that, we now turn.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The first decision where a question involving Section 23 was
passed upon by this Court is the 1967 decision, Castro v. Del Rosario.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The facts in that case were analogous to this litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contested position there was that of
Assistant Regional Revenue Director for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Tomas Toledo was appointed upon a
vacancy occurring therein with the promotion of its occupant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then Chief Revenue Inspector stationed
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He entered the government service only on <st1:date year="1948" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> M. Castro entered the government service in 1931
and as far back as <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>,
was already an Assistant Revenue Regional Director of another district.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
however, <st1:city><st1:place>Toledo</st1:place></st1:city> was the next
ranking official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on that basis
that the claim of petitioner was rejected by the Secretary of Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="GramE">came</span> the action
for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>, certiorari and
mandamus, reliance being had on the aforesaid Section 23 of the Civil Service
Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appointment of <st1:city><st1:place>Toledo</st1:place></st1:city>
was sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After noting that at the
time of such vacancy, he was stationed precisely in the same district, came
this relevant portion of the opinion of this Court, penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>; "Obviously the position of Chief Revenue
Inspector (Examiner) was considered to be of the same rank as the position of
Assistant Revenue Regional Director for regions other than <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Toledo, who was then Chief Revenue
Inspector (Examiner), was chosen because in the opinion of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue he was already in the region where the vacancy occurred and
therefore was more familiar with the work there, and both his salary range and
efficiency rating were higher than Castro's aside from the fact that he was
already performing the functions of the office."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2. Then <span class="GramE">came</span> Reyes v. <span class="SpellE">Abeleda</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
decided in 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question in that
case was who between petitioner Reyes and respondent <span class="SpellE">Abeleda</span>
was entitled to be promoted as the officer next in rank to the position of
Budget Officer IV of the Bureau of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Reyes had been employed in the
government, particularly in the School Finance Division of the Bureau of Public
Schools, since <st1:date year="1940" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1940</st1:date>,
while respondent <span class="SpellE">Abeleda</span> began his career in the
government service on <st1:date year="1937" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1937</st1:date>
and was already the Acting Budget Officer III of such School Finance
Division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was thus the officer next
in rank in such division and was there­fore, in the opinion of respondent
Secretary of Education, entitled to the promotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed an action with the Court of
First Instance for certiorari and mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was dismissed, and he appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On appeal, the decision was sustained, the opinion of the Court
stressing the discretion that is vested in the appointing official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It would seem fairly obvious then that the law does not impose a
rigid or mechanistic formula on the appointing power, compliance with which is
inexorable and a deviation <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Far from it.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there be adherence to the concept that
public office is a public trust, as there ought to be, the criterion should be
what public welfare demands, what satisfies public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is axiomatic that public needs could best
be attended to by officials, about whose competency and ability there is no
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that overmastering
requirement, personal ambition must of necessity yield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discretion if not plenary, at least
sufficient, should thus be granted to those entrusted with the responsibility
of administering the officers concerned, primarily the department heads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are in the most favorable position to
determine who can best fulfill the functions of the office thus vacated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Unless, therefore, the law
speaks in the most mandatory and peremptory tone, considering all the
circumstances, there should be, as there has been, full recognition of the wide
scope of such discretionary authority.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Happily, there is nothing in the
Civil Service Act, </span>which is fittingly concerned with protecting the
rights of those in the career service, that, rightly construed, calls for a
different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well worth
repeating that <span style="">the </span>broad
authority of a department head appears indisputable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Such </span>is
<span style="">the policy </span>of the law, a policy
reflected with fidelity in the decisions of this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

<span class="SpellE">Subido</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
quoted with approval the above excerpt.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
<st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city> opinion even went
further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This Court was even more emphatic in
its recognition of such broad discretion in the appointing power in a case of
later date, where, in the opinion penned by Justice Castro, it was stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'For it is not enough that an aspirant is
qualified and eligible or that he is next in rank or in line for promotion,
albeit by passive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
just as necessary, in order for public administration to be dynamic and
responsive to the needs of the times, that the local executive be allowed the
choice of men of his confidence, provided they are qualified and eligible, who
in his best estimation are possessed of the requisite reputation, integrity, <span class="SpellE">knowledgeability</span>, energy and judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is the local executive, more
than anyone else, who is primarily responsible for efficient governmental
administration in the locality and the effective maintenance of peace and order
therein, and is directly answerable to the people who elected him.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing can be clearer,
therefore, than that the dismissal of this petition was in accordance with
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever sympathy might be elicited
for public officials who had stayed long in the public service and who, for
some reason or another, did not receive the promotion to which they felt they
should be entitled, cannot obscure the discretion that the law leaves in the
hands of the appointing official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
statutory requirement under Section 23 of the Civil Service Act does not lend
itself to any other interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
basic intent of the law itself is to foster a more efficient public
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is ever timely to keep in
mind the public trust character of any governmental office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its creation is justifiable only if it serves
to assure that the functions of government, whether through the traditional
public offices or government-owned or controlled corpo­rations, be attended to
with dispatch and competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neces­sarily
then, the appointing official, especially so where his position is a
constitutional creation, as in this case, must be left that necessary latitude
of choice as to who can best discharge the responsibilities of the office where
the vacancy occurs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what
happened here, and no legal infirmity can validly be said to have vitiated such
an appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impassioned plea of
counsel for petitioner, while not without its plausibility, if the individual
welfare of those in the ranks of government personnel were considered,
certainly cannot merit our approval in the light of the greater and more
exigent public interest which has to be served.</p>
