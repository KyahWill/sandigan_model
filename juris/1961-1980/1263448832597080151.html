<p class="BODY">From the above findings, it is evident that, insofar as the
working arrangement was concerned, there was no real difference between the <u>CONTRACT</u>
and the prior oral agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both were
based on the “<span class="SpellE">cabo</span>" system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under both, (l) the union was an independent
contractor which engaged the services of its members as laborers; (2) the
charges against the consignees and owners of cargoes were made directly by the
union; and (3) the laborers were paid on union payrolls and <u>MARITIMA</u> had
nothing to do with the preparation of the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are the prin­cipal characteristics of the "<span class="SpellE">cabo</span>" system on which the parties based their
relationship after the termination of the <u>CONTRACT</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, since the parties observed the "<span class="SpellE">cabo</span>"
system after the rescission of the <u>CONTRACT</u>, and since the cha­racteristics
of said system show that the contracting union was an independent contractor,
it is reasonable to assume that <u>AFWU</u> continued being an independent
contrac­tor of <u><span style="">MARITIMA.</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And,
being an independent contractor, it could not qualify as an
"employee".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With more reason
would this be true with respect to the laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is no evidence at all regarding the
characteristics of the working arrangement between <u>AFWU</u> and <u>MARITIMA</u>
after the termination of the <u>CONTRACT</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All we <span style="">have
to go </span><span style="">on </span>is the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo's</u> finding that the "<span class="SpellE">cabo</span>" system
was observed - <u>a system that negatives em­ployment relationship</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four elements generally regarded as
indicating the employer-employee relationship - or at the very least, the
element of "control" - must be shown to sustain the conclusion that
there came about such relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lack of such a showing in the case at bar is a fatal to <span class="SpellE"><u>AFWU</u>’s</span>
contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, to uphold the court <u>a</u> <u>quo's</u> conclusion
would be tantamount to the imposition of an employer-employee relationship
against the will of <u>MARITIMA</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This cannot be done, since it would violate <span class="SpellE"><u>MARITIMA</u>’s</span>
exclusive pre­rogative to determine whether it should enter into an em­ployment
contract or not, i.e., whether it should hire others or not<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a> In <span class="SpellE"><u>Pampanga</u></span><u>

<blockquote><span style="">“x
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The general
right to make a con­tract in relation to one's business is an essential part of
the liberty of the citi­zens protected by the due process clause of the
constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The right of a laborer
to sell his labor to such person as he may choose is, in its essence, the same
as the right of an employer to purchase labor from any person whom It chooses</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employer and the employee have thus an
equality of right guaranteed by the constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'If <u>the employer can compel the employee
to work against the latter's will, this is servitude, If the employee can
compel the employer to give him work against the employer's will, this is
oppression</u>.'"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, even if the <u>AFWU</u> laborers continued to perform <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and stevedoring work after August 31, <span style="">1954, </span>it cannot be correctly concluded
- as did the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> - that an employer-employee relationship
– even impliedly at that - arose when before there never had been any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it would appeal unreasonable and
unjust to force such a relationship upon <u>MARITIMA</u> when it had clearly
and continuously manifested its intention not to have any more business
relationship whatsoever with <u>AFWU</u> because of its inefficient
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on­ly to comply with
injunctions and other judicial mandates that <u>MARITIMA</u> continued to abide
by the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>, extending in fact and in effect the operation
of the <u>MARITIMA</u>-<u>AFWU </u>contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only remaining question now is whether, in the <span style="">p</span>articular context of what We have
said, the lower court's ruling ordering a certification election can be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, the duty
to bargain collectively exists only between the "employer' and its
"employees".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
actual negotiations - which may possibly culminate in a concrete collective
bargaining contract - are carried on between the "employer" self and
the official <u>representa­tive</u> of the "employees"<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a><span style=""> - </span>in
most cases, the majority labor union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the only function of a certification election is to determine,
with judicial sanction, who this official representative spokesman of the
"emplo­yees" will be,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a> the
order for certification election in question cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no employer-employee relationship
between the parties disputants, there is neither a "duty to <span class="SpellE">bargan</span> collectively" to speak of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there being no such duty, to hold
certification elections would be pointless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no reason to se­lect a representative to negotiate when there
can be no negotiations in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We therefore hold that where - as in this case - there is no duty to
bargain col­lectively, it is not proper to hold certification elec­tions in
connection therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo's</u><span style=""> objective in imposing the employer- employee
relationship may have been to do away with the "<span class="SpellE">cabo</span>"
system which, although not illegal, is in its operation regarded as <span class="SpellE">disadvantegeous</span> to the laborers and stevedores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule however remains that the end cannot
justify the means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For an action to be
sanctioned by the courts, the purpose must not only be good but the means
undertaken must also be lawful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A true and sincere
concern for the welfare of <u>AFWU</u> members-laborers would call for reforms
within <u>AFWU</u> itself, if the evil of the so-called "<span class="SpellE">cabo</span>" </span>system <span style="">is </span><span style="">to be </span>eliminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As We
suggested </span>in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bermiso</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Hijos</span> de Esca</u><u><span style="">ño</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a> the remedy against the "<span class="SpellE">cabo</span>"
system need not be sought in the courts but in the laborers themselves who
