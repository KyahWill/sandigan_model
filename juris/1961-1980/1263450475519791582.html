appeals from the decision of the Court of First Ins­tance of Manila declaring
of private ownership certain creeks situated in barrio San Esteban, <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">THE BACKGROUND</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> family of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
formerly owned a vast track of marshland in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pam­panga</span> province.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Called Hacienda San Esteban, it was ad­ministered and managed by the
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the year 1860 to about the year 1924 Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
devoted the ha­cienda to the planting and cultivation of <span class="SpellE">nipa</span>
palms from which it gathered <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> sap or
"tuba".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It operated a dis­tillery
plant in barrio San Esteban to turn <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> tuba to
potable alcohol which was in turn manufactured into liquor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accessibility through the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> palms
deep into the hacienda posed as a problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. therefore dug canals leading
towards the hacienda's interior where most of them interlinked with each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The canals facili­tated the
gathering of tuba and the guarding and patrol­ling of the hacienda by security
guards called "<span class="SpellE">arundines</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the gradual process of erosion these
canals acquired the characteristics and dimension of rivers.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1924 Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., shifted from the
business of al­cohol production to <span class="SpellE">bangus</span>
culture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It converted Hacien­da San
Esteban from a forest of <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> groves to a web of
fishponds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so, it cut down the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> palms, cons­tructed dikes and closed the canals <span class="SpellE">criss</span>-crossing the ha­cienda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1925 or 1926 Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
sold a portion of Hacienda San Esteban to Roman Santos who also transformed the
swamp land into a fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so doing,
he closed and built dikes across <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Malauling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maragul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quiñorang</span> <span class="SpellE">Silab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pepangebunan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nigui</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nasi</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The closing of the man-made canals in Hacienda San Esteban drew
complaints from residents of the surrounding communities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claiming that the closing of the canals
caused floods during the rainy season, and that it de­prived them of their
means of transportation and fishing grounds, said residents demanded re-opening
of those canals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Yambao</span> of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, accompanied by policemen and some residents went
to Hacien­da San Esteban and opened the closure dikes at <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ma­lauling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maragul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nigui</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quiñorang</span> <span class="SpellE">Silab</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon,
Roman Santos filed Civil Case No. 4488 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> which preliminarily enjoined Mayor <span class="SpellE">Yambao</span> and others from demolishing the dikes across the
canals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal officials of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> countered by filing a complaint (docketed as Civil
Case No. 4527) in the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Court of First Instance rendered judgment in both
cases against Roman Santos who immediately elevated the case to the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the Secretary of Commerce and Communications<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
conducted his own investigation and found that the aforementioned six streams
closed by Roman Santos were natural, floatable and navigable and were uti­lized
by the public for transportation since time immemorial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He consequently ordered Roman Santos on <st1:date year="1930" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1930</st1:date> to demolish the
dikes across said six streams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
on <st1:date year="1931" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1931</st1:date> the said
official revoked his decision of <st1:date year="1930" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1930</st1:date> and declared the streams in question privately owned
because they were artificially constructed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, upon authority granted under Act 3982 the Secretary of
Commerce and Communications entered into a contract with Roman Santos whereby
the former recognized the private ownership of <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Malauling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maragul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quiñorang</span> <span class="SpellE">Silab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pepangebunan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nigui</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nasi</span> and the latter
turned over for public use two artificial canals and bound himself to maintain
them in navigable state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial
Board of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and the municipal councils of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span> objected to
the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Secretary of
Justice, in his opinion dated <st1:date year="1934" day="6" month="3">March 6,
 1934</st1:date>, upheld its legality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Roman Santos withdrew his appeals in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the portion of Hacienda San Esteban still owned
by the <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> family, the municipal authori­ties of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> filed in 1930 an administrative complaint in the
Bureau of Public Works praying for the opening of the dikes and dams across
certain streams in Hacienda San Esteban.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whereupon, the district engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
and a representative of the Bureau of Public Works conduc­ted
investigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the
Attorney General, upon a query from the Secretary of Commerce and Communica­tions,
rendered an opinion dated October 11, 1930 sustain­ing the latter's power to
declare streams as publicly owned under Sec. 4 of Act 2152, as amended by Act
3208.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1930" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1930</st1:date>
the investigator of the Bureau of Public Works, <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panopio</span>, submitted his report recommending the
removal of the dikes and dams in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And on the basis of said report, the Secretary of Commerce and
Communications rendered his decision on <st1:date year="1930" day="3" month="11">Novem­ber
 3, 1930</st1:date> ordering Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., to
demolish the dikes and dams across the streams named therein situated in
Hacienda San Esteban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., moved for reconsidera­tion, questioning the power of
the Secretary of Commerce and Communications to order the demolition of said
dikes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Days before the Secretary of Commerce and Communica­tions
rendered his aforementioned decision, Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.,
thru counsel, made representations with the Director of Public Works for a
compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its letter
dated <st1:date year="1930" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1930</st1:date>,
Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., offered to admit pu­blic ownership of
the following creeks:</p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span> <span class="SpellE">Teracan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Biuas</span> or <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span> <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, Carbon, <span class="SpellE">Cutut</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dalayap</span>, Enrique, <span class="SpellE">Iba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Inaun</span>, Margarita, <span class="SpellE">Malauli</span> or <span class="SpellE">Budbud</span>, <span class="SpellE">Matalaba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Palapat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Palipit</span> <span class="SpellE">Maisac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Panlo­venas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Panquitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quinapati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quiñorang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bubong</span> or <span class="SpellE">Malauli</span> <span class="SpellE">Malati</span>, Salop, <span class="SpellE">Sinubli</span> and Vitas.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">provided the rest of the streams were
declared private.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on said offer,
the Director of Public Works ins­tructed the surveyor in his office, <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span>, to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and conduct another investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1931" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1931</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Panopio</span> submitted his report to the Director of
Public Works recommending that some streams enumerated therein be declared
public and some private on the ground that they were originally dug by the
hacienda owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private streams
were:</p>

<blockquote>Agape, <span class="SpellE">Atlong</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">He therefore recommended revocation of
the decision already mentioned above, dated November 3, 1930 of the Se­cretary
of Commerce and Communications ordering the de­molition of the dikes closing <span class="SpellE">Malauling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maragul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quiñorang</span> <span class="SpellE">Silab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pepangebonan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nigui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nasi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pinac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1931" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1931</st1:date> the Director of
Public Works con­curred in <span class="SpellE">Panopio's</span> report and
forwarded the same to the Secretary of Commerce and Communications.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1935" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1935</st1:date>
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and the <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> family executed an agreement whereby they recognized
the nature of the streams mentioned in <span class="SpellE">Pano­pio's</span>
report as public or private, depending on the find­ings in said report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This agreement was approved by the Secretary
of Public Works and Communications on <st1:date year="1935" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1935</st1:date> and confirmed the next day by the municipal coun­cil of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> under Resolution No. 36.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few months later, that is, on June 12, 1935, the then Secretary
of Justice issued an opinion holding that the contract executed by the <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span> family and the muni­cipality of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>
has no validity for two reasons, namely, (1) the streams although originally
dug by Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., lost their private nature by
prescription inas­much as the public was allowed to use them for navigation and
fishing, citing Mercado v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>,
59 Phil. 592; and (2) at the time the Secretary of Com­merce and Communications
approved the said contract, he had no more power so to do, because such power
under Sec. 2 of Act 2152 was revoked by the amending Act 4175 which took effect
on December 7, 1934.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the above ruling of the Secretary of Justice, the streams
in question remained closed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1939 administrative investigations were again conducted by
various agencies of the Executive branch of our government culminating in an
order of President Manuel <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> immediately before
the national elections in 1941 requiring the opening of <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macanduling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maragul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ma­cabacle</span>, <span class="SpellE">Balbaro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cansusu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
streams were again closed in 1942 allegedly upon order of President <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">THE CASE</p>

<p class="BODY">Roman Santos acquired in 1940 from the <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
family a larger portion of Hacienda San Esteban wherein are lo­cated 25 streams
which were closed by Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., and are now the
subject matter in the instant controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eighteen years later, that is in 1958, Congress enacted Republic
Act No. 2056<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
following a congressional inquiry which was kindled by a speech delivered by
Sena­tor Rogelio de la Rosa in the Senate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On August 15, 1958 Senator de la Rosa requested in writing the Secretary
of Public Works and Communications to proceed in pursuance of Republic Act No.
2056 against fishpond owners in the province of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
who have closed rivers and appropria­ted them as fishponds without color of
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Musni</span> and other residents
in the vici­nity of Hacienda San Esteban petitioned the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications to open the following streams:</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 2, 4, 10, 30 and 31, and April 1, 1959, the Secretary of
Public Works and Communications rendered his decisions ordering the opening and
restoration of the channel of all the streams in controversy except <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Malauling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maragul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quiñorang</span> <span class="SpellE">Silab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nigui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pepangebonan</span>,

<p class="BODY">On April 29, 1959, that is, after receipt of the Se­cretary's
decision dated March 4, 1959, Roman Santos filed a petition with the Court of
First Instance of Manila for injunction against the Secretary of Public Works
and Com­munications and Julian C. <span class="SpellE">Cargullo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for, preliminary injunction was
granted on <st1:date year="1959" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Se­cretary of Public Works and
Communications answered and alleged as defense that venue was improperly laid;
that Roman Santos failed to exhaust administrative remedies; that the contract
between Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., and the Municipa­lity of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> is null and void; and, that Section 39 of Act 496
excludes public streams from the operation of the Torrens System.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 29 and <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="6">June 12,
 1959</st1:date>, Roman Santos received the decision of the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications dated March 10 and March 30, March 31, and <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, on <st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1959</st1:date> he asked the court to cite in
contempt Secretary <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Moreno, Undersecretary
M.D. Bautista and Julian <span class="SpellE">Cargullo</span> for issuing and
serving upon him the said decisions despite the existence of the preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
opposed the motion alleging that the decisions in ques­tion had long been
issued when the petition for injunc­tion was filed, that they were received
after prelimina­ry injunction issued because they were transmitted through the
District Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> to Roman Santos; that
their issuance was for Roman Santos' information and gui­dance; and, that the
motion did not allege that respon­dents took steps to enforce the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon said motion, on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1959</st1:date>, the trial court
considered unsatisfactory the explanation of the Solicitor General but ruled
that Secretary <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Moreno, Undersecretary M.D.
Bautista and Julian <span class="SpellE">Cargullo</span> acted in good
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they were merely
"admonished to desist from any and further action in this case, observe
the preliminary injunction issued by this Court, with the stern warning,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">ISSUES</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Did
Roman Santos exhaust administrative remedies?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(2) Was venue properly laid?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(3)
Did the lower court err in conducting a trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> of the case
and in admitting evidence not presented during the administrative
proceeding?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(4) Do the streams involved
in this case belong to the public domain or to the owner of Hacienda San
Esteban according to law and the evidence submitted to the Department of Public
Works and Communications?</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents maintain
that Roman Santos resorted to the courts without first exhausting
administrative remedies available to him, namely, (a) motion for recon­sideration
of the decisions of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications; and, (b)
appeal to the Presi­dent of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether a litigant, in exhausting available adminis­trative
remedies, need move for the reconsideration of an administrative decision
before he can turn to the courts for relief, would largely depend upon the
pertinent law,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the rules of procedure and the usual practice followed in a particular office.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 2056 does not require the filing of a motion for
reconsideration as a condition precedent to judicial relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the context of the law, the in­tention
of the legislators to forego a motion for recon­sideration manifests itself
clearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 2056
underscores the urgency and summary nature of the proceedings authorized there
under.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in Section 2 thereof the Secretary
of Public Works and Communications under pain of criminal liability is duty
bound to termi­nate the proceedings and render his decision within a period not
exceeding 90 days from the filing of the com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the same section, the party respondent
concerned is given not more than 30 days within which to comply with the
decision of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, otherwise the
removal of the dams would be done by the Government at the expense of said
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress has precisely provided
for a speedy and a most expeditious proceeding for the removal of illegal
obstructions to rivers and on the basis of such a provi­sion it would be
preposterous to conclude that it had in mind to require a party to file a
motion for reconsidera­tion - an additional proceeding which would certainly
lengthen the time towards the final settlement of exist­ing controversies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The logical conclusion is that Con­gress
intended the decision of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications to be
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> sub­ject to a timely review by
the courts without going through formal and time consuming preliminaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the issues raised during the administrative proceedings
of this case are the same ones submitted to court for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No new matter was introduced during the
proceedings in the court below which the Secretary of Public Works and
Communications had no opportunity to correct under his authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Roman Santos assailed the constitutio­nality of
Republic Act No. 2056 and the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Public Works and
Communications to order the demolition of dams across rivers or streams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those questions are not within the competence
of said Secretary to decide upon a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are purely legal questions, not
administrative in nature, and should properly be aired before a competent court
as was rightly done by petitioner Roman Santos.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, there is no showing in the records of this case that
the Secretary of Public Works and Communi­cations adopted rules of procedure in
investigations autho­rized under Republic Act No. 2056 which require a party
litigant to file a motion for the reconsideration of the Secretary's decision
before he can appeal to the courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Roman Santos however stated in his brief that the prac­tice is not to
entertain motions for reconsideration for the reason that Republic Act No. 2056
does not expressly or impliedly allow the Secretary to grant the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ro­man Santos' statement is supported by
Opinion No. 61, Series of 1959, dated <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1959</st1:date> of the Secretary of Justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the failure of Roman Santos to appeal from the decision of
the Secretary of Public Works and Communications to the President of the
Philippines, suffice it to state that such appeal could be dispensed with
because said Secretary is the alter ego of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actions of the former are presumed to
have the implied sanction of the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that if
this case were considered as an ordinary civil action, venue was improperly
laid when the same was instituted in the Court of First Ins­tance of Manila for
the reason that the case affects the title of a real property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fine, the proposition is that since the
controversy dwells on the ownership of or title to the streams located in
Hacienda San Esteban, the case is a real action which, pursuant to Sec. 3 of
Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, should have been filed in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that the resolution of the controversy in this case
would wholly rest on the ownership of the streams involved herein would not
necessarily classify it as a real action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of this suit is to review the decisions of the Secretary of
Public Works and Communications, to enjoin him from enforcing them and to pre­vent
him from making and issuing similar decisions con­cerning the streams in
Hacienda San Esteban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts of the
Secretary of Public Works and Communications are the object of the litigation,
that is, petitioner Roman San­tos seeks to control them, hence, the suit ought
to be filed in the Court of First Instance whose territorial jurisdiction
encompasses the place where the respondent Secretary is found or is holding
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the rule is that outside its
territorial limits, the court has no power to enforce its orders.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3 of Rule 5 of the Rules of Court does not apply to
determine venue of this action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applicable is Sec. 1 of the same rule, which states:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1. <u>General rule</u>. - Civil ac­tions in Courts of
First Instance may be commenced and tried where the defendant or any of the
defendants resides or may be found, or where the plaintiff or any of the
plaintiffs resides, at the election of the plaintiff."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Accordingly, the petition for injunction
was correctly filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respon­dents Secretary of Public Works and
Communications and Julian <span class="SpellE">Cargullo</span> are found and hold
office in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The lower court tried this case <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against this procedure respondents objected
and maintained that the action, although captioned as an injunction, is really
a petition for certiorari to review the decision of the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­fore,
they now contend that the court should have confined itself to reviewing the
decisions of the respondent Secretary of Public Works and Communications only
on the basis of the evidence presented in the administrative pro­ceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Roman Santos now submits
that the action is a proceeding independent and distinct from the
administrative investigation; that, accordingly, the lower court correctly
acted in trying the case anew and rendering judgment upon evidence adduced
during the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether the action instituted in the Court of First Instance be
for mandamus, injunction or certiorari is not very material.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reviewing the decision of the Secre­tary
of Public Works and Communications, the Court of First Instance shall confine
its inquiry to the evidence presented during the administrative
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evi­dence not presented
therein shall not be admitted and con­sidered by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated by this Court speaking
through Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, in a similar case:</p>

<blockquote>"The findings of the Secretary can not be enervated by new
evidence not laid before him, for that would be tantamount to holding a new
investigation, and to substitute for the discretion and judgment of the
Secretary the discretion and judgment of the court, to whom the statute had not
entrusted the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is immaterial
that the present action should be one for prohibition or injunction and not one
for certiorari; in either event the case must be resolved upon the evidence
submitted to the Secretary, since a judicial review of executive decisions does
not import a trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>, but only an ascertainment of whether
the executive findings are not in violation of the Constitution or of the laws,
and are free from fraud or imposition, and whether they find reasonable support
in the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar, no matter what the parties call it, is in
reality a review of several administrative decisions of the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­ing so, it
was error for the lower court to conduct a trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for purposes of this review,
only the evidence presented and admitted in the adminis­trative investigation
will be considered in our determi­nation of whether on the basis thereof the
decisions of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications were cor­rect.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. We come to the question whether the streams In­volved in this
case belong to the public domain or to the owner of Hacienda San Esteban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said streams are public, then Republic Act
2056 applies if private, then the Secre­tary of Public Works and Communications
cannot order demo­lition of the dikes and dams across them pursuant to his authority
granted by said law.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, we come to the question of the constitutiona­lity of
Republic Act 2056.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court held
Republic Act No. 2056 constitutional but ruled that it was applied by
respondents unconstitutionally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is,
it held that Roman Santos was being deprived of his property without due
process of law, for the dikes of his fishponds were ordered demolished through
an administrative, instead of a Judicial, proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion and rationaliza­tion of the
lower court amount in effect to declaring the law unconstitutional, stated
inversely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that the law provides
for an expeditious administrative process to determine whether or not a dam or
dike should be declared a public nuisance and ordered demolished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to say that such an administrative
process, when put to operation, is unconstitutional is tantamount to saying
that the law it­self violates the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Lovina</span> v. <st1:city><st1:place>Moreno</st1:place></st1:city>,
su­pra, We held said law constitutional.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We see no reason here to hold otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">Discussing now the applicability of Republic Act 2056, the same
applies to two types of bodies of water, namely, (1) <u>public navigable</u>
rivers, streams, coastal waters, wa­ters or waterways and (b) <u>areas declared
as communal fish­ing grounds</u>, as provided for in Section 1 thereof:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the construction or building
of dams, dikes or any other works which encroaches into any public navigable
river, stream, coastal waters and any other navigable public waters or
waterways as well as the construction or building of dams, dikes or any other
works in areas declared as communal fishing grounds, shall be ordered removed
as public nuisances or as prohibited constructions as herein provided:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We are not concerned with communal
fishing grounds be­cause the streams here involved have not been so declared,
but with public navigable streams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question there­fore is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are the streams
in Hacienda San Esteban which are mentioned in the petition of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Musni</span> and others, public
and navigable?</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents contend that said streams are public on the following
grounds:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1) Hacienda San
Esteban was formerly a marshland and being so, it is not susceptible to
appropriation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore belongs to
the State.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondents rely on Mon­tano
v. Insular Government, 12 Phil. 572.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2) The streams in
question are natural streams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
tributaries of public streams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cited are
the cases of Samson v. <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> et al., 11 Phil. 538
and Bautista v. <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>, 23 Phil. 636.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-top: 12pt;">(3) The streams have for their source
public rivers, therefore they cannot be classified as canals.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4) Assuming the
streams were artificially made by Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., said
titleholder lost ownership over them by prescription when it allowed the public
to use them for navigation for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents cite Mercado v. Municipal President of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>,
59 Phil. 592.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(5)
Assuming the streams in question are not men­tioned as public in the
certificates of title held by Aya­la y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., over
Hacienda San Esteban, still they cannot be considered as privately owned for
Section 39 of Act 496 expressly excepts public streams from private owner­ship.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(6) The <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span> Report, which found the streams in question of
private ownership was nullified by the Secre­tary of Justice in his opinion
dated <st1:date year="1935" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1935</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the contract between Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., and the Secretary of Commerce and Communications
agreeing on the ownership of the streams in question is <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine in Montano v. Insular Government, <u>supra</u>, that
a marshland which is inundated by the rise of the tides belongs to the State
and is not susceptible to ap­propriation by occupation - has no application
here inas­much as in said case the land subject matter of the litigation was
not yet titled and precisely <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> Montano sought
title thereon on the strength of ten years, occu­pation pursuant to paragraph
6, section 54 of Act 926 of the Philippine Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas, the subject matter in this case -
Hacienda San Esteban - is titled land and private ownership thereof by Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., has been re­cognized by the King of Spain and later
by the Philippine Government when the same was registered under Act 496.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents further cite Bautista v. <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>,
23 Phil. 631, where the plaintiff sought injunction against the defendants who
allegedly constructed a dam across a public canal which conveyed water from the
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Obando</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to fishponds belonging to several persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>The canal was situated within a public land</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sustaining the injunc­tion granted by the
Court of First Instance, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"No private person has a right to usurp possession of a
watercourse, branch of a ri­ver, or lake of the public domain and use, <u>un</u>­<u>less
it shall have been proved that he cons­tructed the same within property of his

legal provisions which ex­plicitly exclude such waterways from the exclusive
use or possession of a private party."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As indicated in the above-cited case, a
private person may take possession of a watercourse if he constructed the same
within his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This puts Us into

within Hacien­da San Esteban are publicly or privately owned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We refer to the so-called <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span>
Report which contains the findings and recommendations of <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panopio</span>, a surveyor in the Bureau of Public Works,
who was designated to conduct formal hearings and investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said report found the following streams,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1931" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1931</st1:date>
the Director of Public Works transmitted the <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span>

thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, on <st1:date year="1935" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1935</st1:date>, Secretary of Public Works and

concern­ing the ownership of the streams in Hacienda San Esteban, for being in
conformity with said <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span> Report.</p>

<p class="BODY">This agreement of Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., and the
Municipali­ty of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> which was approved by the
Secretary of Public Works and Communications only on February 27, 1935, could
not however bind the Government because the power of the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications to enter thereto had been suppressed by the Philippine
Legislature when it enacted Act 4175 which took effect on December 7, 1934.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nullity of the aforesaid contract would:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not of course affect the findings of fact
contained in the <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span> Report.</p>

<p class="BODY">In weighing the evidence presented before the administrative
investigation which culminated in this appeal, respondent Secretary seemed to
have ignored the <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span> Report and other documentary
evidence as well as the testimony of witnesses presented by petitioner but
instead gave credence only to the witnesses of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Musni</span>, et al.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon review, however, the lower court, taking into account all the
evidence adduced in the administrative hearing, including the <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span> Report, as well as those presented for the first
time before it, sustained peti­tioner's averment that the streams in question
were arti­ficially made, hence of private ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated, this conclusion of the lower court
which is in accordance with the findings of <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span>
as contained in his report, finds ample support from the evidence presented and
ad­mitted in the administrative investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, we see no merit in disturbing the lower court's findings of
fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">We next consider the issue of whether, under perti­nent laws, the
streams in question are public or private.</p>

<p class="BODY">We quote Articles 339, 407 and 408 of the Spanish Civil Code of
1889:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 339.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Property of

no ownership over it, nor any right to make uses of its beds or banks, unless they
base their claim on title deed which specify the right or the ownership
claimed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Articles 71 and 72 of the Spanish Law of
Waters of <st1:date year="1866" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1866</st1:date>
state:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 71.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
water-beds of all creeks belong to the owners of the estates or lands over
which they flow."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 72.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
water-beds on public land, of creeks through which spring waters run, are a
part of the public domain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The natural water-beds or channels of rivers are also part of
the public domain."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Article 71 of the Spanish Law of Waters of <st1:date year="1866" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1866</st1:date>, and Article 408(5) of
the Spanish Ci­vil Code, channels of creeks and brooks belong to the owners of
estates over which they flow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
channels, therefore, of the streams in question which may be class­ified as
creeks, belong to the owners of Hacienda San Esteban.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said streams, considered as canals, of which they originally
were, are of private ownership in con­templation of Article 339(1) of the
Spanish Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 339,
canals constructed by the State and devoted to public use are of public
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, canals
constructed by private persons within private lands and devoted exclusively for
private use must be of private ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our attention has been called to the case of Mercado v. Municipal
President of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, 59 Phil. 592.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There the creek (<span class="SpellE">Batasan-Limasan</span>)
involved was originally dug by the estate's owner who, subsequently allowed
said creek to be used by the public for navigation and fish­ing purposes for a
period of 22 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said this Court
through Mr. Justice Diaz:</p>

<blockquote>"And even granting that the <span class="SpellE">Batasan­Limasan</span>
creek acquired the proportions which it had, before it was closed, as a result
of excavations made by laborers of the appel­lant's predecessor in interest, it
being a fact that, since the time it was opened as a water route between the <span class="SpellE">Nasi</span> River and <span class="SpellE">Lima­san</span> creek,
the owners thereof as well as strangers, that is, both the residents of the
hacienda and those of other nearby bar­rios and municipalities, had been using
it not only for their <span class="SpellE">bancas</span> to pass through but also
for fishing purposes, and it being also a fact that such was the condition of
the creek at least since 1906 until it was closed in 1928, if the appellant and
her pre­decessors in interest had acquired any right to the creek in question
by virtue of exca­vations which they had made thereon, they had lost such right
through prescription, in­asmuch as they failed to obtain, and in fact they have
not obtained, the necessary autho­rization to devote it to their own use to the
exclusion of all others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use and enjoy­ment
of a creek, as any other property sus­ceptible of appropriation, may be
acquired or lost through prescription, and the appel­lant and her predecessors
in interest certain­ly lost such right through the said cause, and they cannot
now claim it exclusively for themselves after the general public had been
openly using the same from 1906 to 1928.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the cited case, the creek could have
been of private ownership had not its builder lost it by prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the principle therein enunciated to
the case at bar, the conclusion would be inevitably in favor of pri­vate
ownership, considering that the owners of Hacienda San Esteban held them for
their exclusive use and-prohi­bited the public from using them.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that in the opinion, mentioned ear­lier, issued
on June 12, 1935, the Secretary of Justice answered in the negative the query
of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications whether the latter can
declare of private ownership those streams which "were dug up artificially",
because it was assumed that the streams were used by the public as fishing
ground and in transporting their commerce in <span class="SpellE">bancas</span>
or in small crafts without the objection of the parties who dug"
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, <u>Mercado v.
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span></u> was given application
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the facts, as then
found by the Bureau of Public Works, do not support the factual premise that
the streams in question were used by the pu­blic "without the objection of
the parties who dug" them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
cannot therefore take as controlling in determining the merits of this case the
factual premises and the le­gal conclusion contained in said opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar should be differentiated from those cases where
We held illegal the closing and/or appropria­tion of rivers or streams by
owners of estates through which they flow for purposes of converting them into
fish­ponds or other works.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those cases, the watercourses which were
dammed <u>were natural navigable streams and used habitually by the public for
a long time as a means of navigation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, they belong to the public do­main either as rivers
pursuant to Article 407(1) of the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 or as property
devoted to pu­blic use under Article 339 of the same Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas, the streams involved in this case <u>were
artificially made and devoted to the exclusive use of the hacienda owner</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cansusu</span>,
being a natural stream and a continuation of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cansusu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
admittedly a public stream, belongs to the public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its closure therefore by the predecessors of
Roman Santos was illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for the opening of <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Malauling</span> <span class="SpellE">Maragul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quiñorang</span> <span class="SpellE">Silab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nigui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pepangebunan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nasi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bulacus</span> was dismissed by
the Secretary of Public Works and Communications and the case considered
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said administrative decision
has not been questioned in this appeal by either party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they are deemed ex­cluded herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the other streams, being artificial and devoted exclusively
for the use of the hacienda owner and his personnel, are declared of private
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the dams across them
should not be ordered demolished as public nuisances.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the issue of contempt of court on the part of the
Secretary of Public Works and Communica­tions and Julian <span class="SpellE">Cargullo</span>
for the alleged issuance of administrative decisions ordering demolition of
dikes involved in this case after the writ of injunction was granted and
served, suffice it to state that the lower court made no finding of contempt of
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily/ there is no
conviction for contempt <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by this Court and
any discussion on the matter would be academic.</p>
