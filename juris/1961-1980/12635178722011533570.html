				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> S. del Rosario, firm
in her belief that under the relevant provision of the Civil Service Law she
was the-officer next in rank, "competent and qualified to hold the
position", possessed of "an appropriate civil service
eligibility" and thus entitled to be promoted as Assistant Chief
Accountant IV in the Bureau of Public Highways, in which there was a vacancy,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
filed this <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> proceeding on January 27, 1969
against respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>,
as Commissioner of Civil Service as well as the other respondent, Jesus D. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>, who was appointed to such a position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She assailed the validity of the
determination of respondent Commissioner of <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1968</st1:date>, holding that respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> was rightfully entitled to such a promotion and
approving the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the contention
of petitioner that <i>certiorari</i> lies as the act of respondent Commissioner
was in excess of his authority, and that <i>mandamus</i> lies as he refused or
neglected to consider her promotion to the disputed position.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the above determination of respondent Commissioner of
<st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1968</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
there was a protest to the appointment of the other respondent Jesus D. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> by petitioner "on the ground of alleged
violation of the Civil Service Law and rules on promotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These papers show that Mrs. del Rosario was
originally proposed for appointment to the position in question but Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> protested the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Department Complaints Commission in its
decision dated <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1968</st1:date>
found the protest of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> meritorious and
recommended that the appointment of Mrs. del Rosario to the same position be
returned to the Commissioner of Public Highways without action and that
protestant <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> be appointed in her instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated April 1, 1968 the Secretary
of Public Works and Communications furnished Mrs. del Rosario a copy of said
decision and stated further that 'In view of the findings contained therein,
which the undersigned fully concurs, the Commissioner of Public Highways is
being directed to submit instead the appointment of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>
to the position concerned and that the residual vacancy of Chief Accountant I
which will be vacated by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> shall in turn
be given to you, in justice and fairness to all concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was there further stated:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Records show that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> now holds
the position of Chief Accountant I in, the BPH while Mrs. del Rosario holds the
position of Accountant III in the same Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the proposed Merit Promotion Plan of the BPH the position next in
rank to Assistant Chief Accountant IV is Chief Accountant I."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Then it was noted that in a letter of August 4, 1967 the Commissioner of Public
Highways, in connection with a present case of a certain <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span>
M. Fernandez against the petitioner for the position of Chief Accountant IV,
the organizational chart of the division as approved by the Secretary of Public
Works and Communications would show that she was only next in rank to
respondent Jesus <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>, then Chief Accountant I,
"and not to the Chief Accountant IV." From which, it was the
conclusion of respondent Commissioner:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is clear from the foregoing that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>
is the employee next in rank who should be promoted to the position of
Assistant Chief Accountant IV and not Mrs. del Rosario who may be considered as
next in rank only to the position of Chief Accountant I, the position to be
vacated by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the same communication, respondent Commissioner likewise
answered the contention that determination of the employee next in rank should
be on a division-wide basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The allegation that the selection of
the next in rank employee in the instant case should be on a division-wide
basis is without merit because Sec. 3(a) of Civil Service Rule VII provides
that determination of the Officer or employee next in rank should provide for
as wide an area of selection as possible within the Department or Agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, good management requires that the
promotional area should not be artificially restricted by section or division
lines, except when such restriction is demonstrably in the interest of the
service as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case
it cannot be gainsaid that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> who is Chief
Accountant I is the employee next in rank who is competent and qualified and
who possess the appropriate eligibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to state that the Mindanao Equipment Depot is still part of
the Accounting Division, which exercises technical supervision over it."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the respective qualifications of respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>, respondent Commissioner had this to say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mr. <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>
holds the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Commerce and Bachelor of Laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is an Auditor eligible and was granted CPA
eligibility under RA 1080.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He attended
in-service training and seminars on Bookkeeping and Auditing; Personnel and
Fiscal Administration (BPH-Manila) and Public Administration (Civil Service-<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was first
employed in the government service as Bookkeeper in the Budget Commission on <st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1957</st1:date> and held such
positions as Accountant I and Chief Accountant I to which position he was
promoted sometime in 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His latest
efficiency rating is 94%."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor did he fail to take account of the circumstances relied upon by petitioner
to demonstrate her alleged right as the person next in rank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"On the other hand, Mrs. del Rosario likewise holds the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Commerce and has earned 6 units leading to the degree of
Master of Arts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has had in-service
training on Mechanized Accounting (Erlanger &amp; <span class="SpellE">Galenger</span>)
and Accounting Procedures and Techniques (Budget Commission).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is a Supervisor (First Grade) Promotional
and Auditor eligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was also
granted CPA eligibility under RA 1080.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was first employed in the government service as a Teacher in the
City Schools on <st1:date year="1945" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1945</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1959 she was appointed Bookkeeper
II in the Budget Commission and on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1963</st1:date> she was appointed Accountant III which position she still
holds up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her latest
efficiency rating is 90%.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the light of the above considerations that respondent
Commissioner decided the matter adversely to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now contended that in reaching the
conclusion as to who was entitled to the disputed position, the determination
of respondent Commissioner is infected with the virus of a grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were so, then <i>certiorari</i>
lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no legal right on the part of
petitioner, neither does <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the first decision
of this court where the question of who is the person next in rank competent
and qualified to hold the position and who possesses an appropriate civil
service eligibility, thus entitling him to promotion,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the need for a clear and sufficient showing that the officer seeking the
promotion comes clearly within its terms was stressed by us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, petitioner failed to do, contenting
herself with the use of language intended to cast doubt on the challenged
determination of respondent Commissioner whom she would accuse of merely
relying on "the mere designation or nomenclature of the position."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This is to ignore the fact, of which respondent Commissioner took note that on
the very face of the organizational chart to which no valid objection had
previously been interposed, petitioner's position was lower than that of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would follow then that having failed to meet the burden required of
her by the controlling doctrine, her allegation as to the alleged abuse of
discretion cannot be seriously entertained, thus precluding the issuance of a
writ of <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor would <i>mandamus</i>
lie to respect what has been shown to be a non-existent legal right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was noted in
discussing the facts that the finding of respondent Commissioner was that
petitioner was of a lower rank than respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the situation be considered in the
light most favorable to her and her claim to the position be predicated on her
occupying a position whose rank was equivalent to that of respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>, still her petition could not be considered
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown in the answer of
respondent Commissioner, it was the belief of the department head, after he had
given the matter the most careful attention that the disputed position should
be given to respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that petitioner had to dispute,
first before respondent Commissioner and now with this Court, such an
appointment, conclusively argues against the intimation found in the petition
that, were it not for the determination of respondent Commissioner, petitioner
would be the fortunate recipient of such an appointment.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It being clear that the proper department head had concluded that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Macrohon</span> was entitled to the position in
question and had extended the appropriate appointment, petitioner, even on the
assumption that she should have been considered likewise to fill up such
vacancy, had, under the settled doctrines of this Court, no other recourse but
to abide by such a choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had
occasion to so decide in Reyes v. <span class="SpellE">Abeleda</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It would seem fairly obvious
then that the law does not impose a rigid or mechanistic formula on the
appointing power, compliance with which is inexorable and a deviation <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far
from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there be adherence to the
concept that public office is a public trust, as there ought to be, the
criterion should be what public welfare demands, what satisfies public
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is axiomatic that
public needs could be attended to by officials, about whose competency and
ability there is no question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that
overmastering requirement, personal ambition must of necessity yield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discretion if not plenary, at least
sufficient, should thus be granted to those entrusted with the responsibility
of administering the officers concerned, primarily the department heads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are in the most favorable position to
determine who can best fulfill the functions of the office thus vacated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless, therefore, the law speaks in the most
mandatory and peremptory tone, considering all the circumstances, there should
be, as there has been, full recognition of the wide scope of such discretionary
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Happily, there is nothing in
the Civil Service Act, which is fittingly concerned with protecting the rights
of these in the career service, that, rightly construed, calls for a different
conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well worth repeating
that the broad authority of a department head appears indisputable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the policy of the law, a policy
reflected with fidelity in the decisions of this Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court was even more emphatic in its recognition of such
broad discretion in the appointing power in a case of later date,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
where, in the opinion penned by Justice Castro, it was stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For it is not enough that an aspirant
is qualified and eligible or that he is next in rank or line for promotion,
albeit by passive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
just as necessary, in order for public administration to be dynamic and
responsive to the needs of the times, that the local executive be allowed the
choice of men of his confidence, provided they are qualified and eligible, who
in his best estimation are possessed of the requisite reputation, integrity, <span class="SpellE">knowledgeability</span>, energy and judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is the local executive, more
than anyone else, who is primarily responsible for efficient governmental
administration in the locality and the effective maintenance of peace and order
therein, and is directly answerable to the people who elected him."</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, in the very petition itself, Jimenez v.
Francisco<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
was invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner ought to have
been more cautious in the choice of authority cited, for while not directly in
point, the opinion in this case by former Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>
would sustain the conclusion arrived at by respondent Commissioner in deference
to what was decided by Secretary <span class="SpellE">Raquiza</span> insofar as
it accords explicit recognition to such broad discretionary appointing
authority of the official concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Petitioners claim
that after becoming a civil service eligible on <st1:date year="1951" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1951</st1:date>, he was entitled to a permanent
appointment to the position from which he was removed, is not sanctioned by any
law or regulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to appoint
is in essence discretionary on the part of the proper authority, in this case
the head of the department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appointing power has the right of choice which he may exercise freely according
to his judgment, deciding for himself who is best qualified for any competitive
position in the Civil Service."</p>

<p class="BODY">The last two decisions cited, while subject to being
distinguished from the present litigation as the facts are different, still
stood for a principle which sustains the determination of respondent
Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No grave abuse of
discretion can therefore be imputed to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor, as is equally clear, can it be plausibly maintained that petitioner
was deprived thereby of a clear legal right.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against
petitioner.</p>
