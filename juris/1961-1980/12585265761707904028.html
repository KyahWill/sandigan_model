<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal from a decision 
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The parties do not dispute these 
antecedent facts: <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> claimed to own 50 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> 
of land (140 has.) in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Matalahib</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Masambong</span>, 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Quezon</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE">City</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by virtue of an <span class="SpellE">informacion</span> <span class="SpellE">possessoria</span>. This was 
inherited by his son, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> and upon the 
latter's death, by <span class="SpellE">Plorencio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aniana</span>, Pedro and Maria <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> 
(referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>). Since <span class="SpellE">Telesforo's</span> time, the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> had 
disposed of several portions of the land. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In 1914, J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. (referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>) obtained Original Certificate of Title No. 735 
covering said land. The <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> sued the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>, seeking the annulment of the title certificate. The 
result was a compromise agreement dated March 16, 1953 whereby the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> renounced their rights to the land, recognized the 
complete and indefeasible title of the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>, in 
consideration of P1,201,063. Pursuant to the agreement, upon payment of 
P100<span class="GramE">,000</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> 
obtained possession of 20 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> (90 has.) of the 
land. Because the balance of P1<span class="GramE">,101,063</span> was unpaid, the 
<span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> went to court to rescind the agreement for 
such non-payment. This Court, when the case reached It on appeal, ruled that 
since the payment depended on the delivery of the remaining 30 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> of land, the obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> to pay ceased when the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> failed to deliver the 30 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> and in that respect, or to that extent, the 
agreement was rescinded (<span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, L-13768, May 30, 1961; <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, L-20015, October 
31, 1963). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the meantime, the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> had instituted <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
suits against occupants of the lands covered by their </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Torrens</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> title. These occupants claimed 
to have acquired the lands by purchase from the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> and alleged that under the compromise agreement the 
<span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> agreed to assume the obligations of the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> with them to the extent of acknowledging their 
rights to buy or continue paying the value of their lands as per contract with 
the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>. The <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> 
however contended that the compromise agreement called for execution of new 
sales agreements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The plaintiffs here, Jose de 
Jesus, et al., filed an amended complaint on December 5, 1962, alleging inter 
<span class="SpellE">alia</span> that they purchased their lots from the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> and have either fully or partially paid; that on 
February 28, 1957 CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Judge <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Caluag</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, C.C. No. Q-135, 
ruled, subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeals on June 27, 1961, that the 
purchasers from the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, named in the list 
attached to the compromise agreement, were entitled to continue their purchase 
of lots they occupy and shall not be ejected <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> 
nor shall their constructions be demolished until final determination of their 
rights; that on the basis of these orders, the plaintiffs, being "identically 
and similarly situated,”<span class="style11">[*]</span> have the right to be 
heard on their claim of ownership; that they tend to be damaged and prejudiced 
by the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits filed by the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> unless the court issues a writ of preliminary 
injunction in their favor; and that they are willing to pay for their lots 
should the court rule in their favor. They prayed the court to declare their 
right to buy their lots as per compromise agreement; to issue a writ of 
preliminary injunction to stop the threatened demolition of their houses; and to 
grant them P500 as attorney's fee, plus costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The defendant <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> answered on December 11, 1962, alleging as 
affirmative defenses that (1) the cause of action is barred by prior judgment; 
(2) the complaint states no cause of action; (3) the court has no jurisdiction 
to interfere by injunction and stop the execution of decisions of Salas IV and V 
of the same CPI; and (4) the plaintiffs are <span class="SpellE">misjoined</span>. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subsequently, defendants moved to 
dismiss, relying on their affirmative defenses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 10, 1963, the Court of 
First Instance ruled in its decision that the compromise agreement upon which 
the plaintiffs' cause of action depends having already been rescinded and set 
aside by the Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, L-13768, May 30, 1961, the action should be, as it 
was thereby, dismissed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The plaintiffs appealed directly 
to <span class="GramE">Us</span> from the decision of dismissal. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It can readily be seen from the 
amended complaint that the plaintiffs depend on the compromise agreement for the 
enforcement of their alleged rights. The situation herein is not materially 
different from that in <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>, L-16836, </span><st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 30, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
in Gonzales v. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, L-21692, </span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 29, <span class="GramE">1965</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> ,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> where the alleged <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> vendees, threatened with eviction by <span class="SpellE">ejectments</span> suits brought by the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span>, filed separate actions to enforce their claimed 
preferential rights under the same compromise agreement. In said previous cases, 
<span class="GramE">We</span> held that this preferential right should be set up 
in the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions, it being in the nature of a 
compulsory counterclaim therein, otherwise the same would be barred, pursuant to 
Section 6 of Rule 10 - now Section 4 of Rule 9 - of the Rules of Court: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 
6.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Counterclaim not set up barred. </span></em>- A 
counterclaim not set up shall be barred if it arises out of or is necessarily 
connected with, the transaction or occurrence that is the subject-matter of the 
opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of 
third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It plainly appears that the 
asserted right of the plaintiffs herein is necessarily connected with the 
subject-matter of the afore-stated <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions 
of the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> against them. And it is not contended 
that there are necessary third parties beyond the reach of the court's process. 
The plaintiffs, as mentioned earlier, alleged in their amended complaint, 
particularly paragraph 8 thereof, that <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits 
filed by the <span class="SpellE">Tuasons</span> threaten their eviction. Nothing 
in the records before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, except for the claim of 
defendants that the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions have already 
become final, indicates whether the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> suits 
have indeed become final or are still pending. It is clear, though, that, as 
stated, plaintiffs' action here is in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim in 
those <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions. As compulsory counterclaims, 
therefore, these may not be set up in subsequent actions such as this one. To 
avoid, multiplicity of suits, they should rather be asserted in the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions, <span class="GramE">If</span> the same had 
not yet resulted in final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
hereby affirmed, with costs against appellants. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
