				<H3>ANTONIO RAGUDO, AND EUGENIA PAREDES, PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS, VS. EMELITA R. PASNO, REPRESENTED BY HER FATHER, ENRIQUE R. PASNO AS HER GUARDIAN AD-LITEM, DEFENDANT-APPELLEE.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order dismissing plaintiffs complaint. In the Quezon court of 
first instance, the spouses Antonio Ragudo and Eugenia Paderes filed this 
complaint on October 12, 1959, to annul the order of the justice of the peace of 
Tayabas, same province, declaring Emelita R. Pasno their adopted child, which 
order, dated July 31, 1959, was already final. The spouses alleged substantially 
that they had been induced by Emelita's parents to believe that the adoption 
proceeding in the justice of the peace court, "was merely for the purpose of 
transferring to 8-year old Emelita some guerilla educational benefits available 
to Antonio Ragudo." Plaintiffs further alleged that the adoption had been 
secured "thru fraud and misrepresentation used by defendant Enrique Pasno 
(father of Emelita) upon the plaintiffs, as the latter never intended to adopt" 
Emelita "as their child."
<p>Instead of answering, the defendants moved for dismissal of the complaint, 
arguing that as the justice of the peace court has concurrent jurisdiction with 
the courts of first instance to take cognizance of adoption cases, the latter 
has no jurisdiction to interfere or annul the order issued in said adoption 
proceeding.</p>
<p>Upholding defendants' contention, the judge dismissed the case. Hence this 
appeal.</p>
<p>There is no question that a justice of the peace court has jurisdiction over 
adoption cases. (Republic Acts 643 and 644). Courts of first instance also have 
jurisdiction over the same.</p>
<p>But this is not an adoption case. This is a civil action to annul an order of 
a justice of the peace court, allegedly obtained thru fraud. It is based on sec. 
43 of Act 190<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>. Of such action, justice 
of the peace courts can not take cognizance. And it falls within the general 
jurisdiction of courts of first instance.</p>
<p>It is argued for the appellees that under Art. 348 of the New Civil Code, 
fraud is not one of the grounds for revocation of an adoption. The appellants 
reply, quite correctly, that those grounds refer only to an adoption 
<i>validly</i> decreedâ€”not to an adoption void from the beginning because 
tainted with fraud. Anyway, this is an argument that should be submitted when 
the case is considered on the merits.</p>
<p>The appealed order is reversed and the case is hereby remanded for further 
proceedings.</p>
<p><i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br></p>
