				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><p>Appeal from a judgment or decision of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, Hon. Gustavo Victoriano, presiding, sentencing defendants
Concepcion Mining Company and Jose Sarte to pay jointly and severally
to the plaintiff the amount of P7,197.26 with interest up to September

<p>Upon the filing of the complaint the defendants presented their
answer in which they allege that the co-maker of the promissory note
Don Vicente L. Legarda, died on February 24, 1946 and his estate is in
the process of judicial determination in Special Proceedings No. 29060
of the Court of First Instance of Manila. On the basis of this
allegation it is prayed, as a special defense, that the estate of said
deceased Vicente L. Legarda be included as party-defendant. The court
in its decision ruled that the inclusion of said defendant is
unnecessary and immaterial, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 1216 of the new Civil Code and section 17 (g) of the Negotiable
Instruments Law.</p>
<p> A motion to reconsider this decision was denied and thereupon
defendants presented a petition for relief, asking that the effects of
the judgment be suspended for the reason that the deceased Vicente L.
Legarda should have been included as a party-defendant and his
liability should be determined in pursuance of the provisions of the
promissory note. This motion for relief was also denied, hence
defendant appealed to this Court.</p>
<p> Section "17 (<em>g</em>) of the Negotiable Instruments Law provides as follows:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p> "SEC. 17. Construction where instrument is ambiguous.—Where the
language of the instrument is ambiguous or there are omission therein,
the following rules of construction apply:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "(g) Where an instrument containing the words 'I
promise to pay' is signed by two or more persons, they are deemed to be
jointly and severally liable thereon." And Article 1216 of the Civil
Code of the Philippines also provides as follows:</p>
  <p> "ART.
1216. The creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors
or some of them simultaneously. The demand made against one of them
shall not be an obstacle to those which may subsequently be directed
against the others, so long as the debt has not been fully collected."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In view of the above quoted provisions, and as the promissory note
was executed jointly and severally by the same parties, namely,
Concepcion Mining Company, Inc. and Vicente L. Legarda and Jose S.
Sarte, the payee of the promissory note had the right to hold any one
or any two of the signers of the promissory note responsible for the
payment of the amount of the note. This judgment of the lower court
should be affirmed.</p>
<p> Our attention has been attracted to the discrepancies in the
printed record on appeal. We note, first, that the names of the
defendants, who are evidently the Concepcion Mining Co., Inc. and Jose
S. Sarte, do not appear in the printed record on appeal. The title of
the complaint set forth in the record on appeal does not contain the
name of Jose Sarte, when it should, as two defendants are named in the
complaint and the only defense of the defendants is the non-inclusion
of the deceased Vicente L. Legarda as a defendant in the action. We
also note that the copy of the promissory note which is set forth in
the record on appeal does not contain, the name of the third maker Jose
S. Sarte Fortunately, the brief of appellee on page 4 sets forth said
name of Jose S. Sarte as one of the co-makers of the promissory note.
Evidently, there is an attempt to mislead the court into believing that
Jose S. Sarte is not one of the co-makers. The attorney for the
defendants is Atty. Jose S. Sarte himself and he should be held
primarily responsible for the correctness of the record on appeal We,
therefore, order the said Atty. Jose S. Sarte to explain why in his
record on appeal his own name as one of the defendants does not appear
and neither does his name appear as one of the co-signers of the
promissory note in question. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em>concur.</p></div>
