				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The security of tenure included in the constitutional pro­vision
on protection to labor under the present Constitution affords sufficient basis
for sustaining the decision of respondent National Labor Relations Commission
sought to be set aside in this petition for certiorari filed by the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The allegation of arbitrariness and consequent lack of due process, whether in
its procedural or substantive aspect, by petitioner Central Textile Mills,
Inc., lacks basis, as pointed out clearly by Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza in his Comment con­sidered as the
Answer.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The dismissal of private respondent Daniel <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
which was set aside by respondent Commission was premised on the failure to
substantiate the charge that he was guilty of theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in its Decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The right to reinstatement, after
finding that the dismissal of an employee is illegal, becomes a must.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is imperative, if only to give meaning
and fulfillment to the security of tenure clause in the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Why a petition of this character lacks merit was rendered even more evident by
the Comment of Solicitor General Mendoza that as no dismissal was even
contemplated had not management imputed theft to private respondent, an
accusation investigated and thereafter found without basis not only by two
Assistant Fiscals of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City but also by
respondent Commission, it would be to render nugatory the security of tenure
provision if there were no reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is to abide by the authoritative pronouncement in Philippine Air
Lines, Inc. v. Philippine Airlines Employees Association.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision sought to
be set aside in its opening paragraph set forth the decisive fact as to the
failure to prove the allegation of theft.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It considered such accusation "a bankrupt assertion in the light of
the recommendation of the investigating Assistant City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Costales</span>," which was
for dismissing the unwarranted charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was the view of Assistant City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Costales</span> of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in
the reinvestigation of such complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was thus an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the same
conclusion by Assistant City Fiscal Nestor <span class="SpellE">Batungbakal</span>
of the same City.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Both the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office then and respondent
Commission are united in the view that no theft was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation of arbitrariness must,
therefore, fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter was duly and
carefully investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof as to
the allegation of theft certainly did not suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the imposition of a
penalty for an offense not committed is unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, there is pertinence to the
following excerpt from the Comment:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is not also accurate for petitioner to say that the public
respondents simply relied on the findings of the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar underwent
conciliation and then compulsory arbitration where evidence was adduced by both
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After an adverse decision by
Labor Arbiter Daniel M. Lucas, Jr., petitioner appealed to the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span> on both questions of fact and of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1978</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span> affirmed the decision
of the Labor Arbiter with modifications.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied
by the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span> en banc on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these show that the petitioner was given all the chance to present
its evidence and ventilate its arguments before the public respondents."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
There was then no violation of the due process clause, whether in its
procedural or substantive aspect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the finding of fact thus arrived at by the conscientious
exercise of official function, that no theft could be imputed to private
respondent, is entitled to the fullest respect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it has been reiterated time and time again.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
We do so once more.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weakness of the
petition, to repeat, is thus indisputable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, however, would try to impart a semblance of plausibility by
alleging that even on the assumption that no theft was committed, still there
was loss of confidence sufficient to cause his dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Philippine Air Lines decision referred
to, the accusation that theft was committed by the employee was likewise not
borne out by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To justify a
dismissal, management relied on the allegation that there was breach of trust,
a ground analogous to loss of confidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Industrial Relations did not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reinstatement was ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it must be in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a vague, all-encompassing pretext as
loss of confidence, if given the seal of approval by this Court, could easily
be utilized to reduce to a barren form of words the constitutional guarantee of
security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the
employee is afforded that protection so that his means of livelihood is not
placed at the mercy of management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
just as much a participant in the industrial process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is entitled to be considered as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constitutional provisions protecting labor
are in line with the predominant thinking all over the world safeguarding human
dignity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would then be to ignore not
only a mandate of the fundamental law but also a counsel of wisdom and fair
play to impart to the concept of loss of confidence such a latitudinarian
scope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What matters the investigation
undergone by private respondent resulting in the affirmation of his innocence,
if thereafter management would just rely on an alleged loss of confidence?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional provision is not to be so
easily brushed aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were
otherwise, there would be failure, in the language of the Philippine Air Lines
opinion "to conform to the ideal of the New Society, the establishment of
which was so felicitously referred to by the First Lady as the Compassionate
Society."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no implication in
this opinion that under certain circumstances, loss of confidence could not
justify termination of the service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There may be cases where an employee of a managerial rank would be hard
put to avoid separation from the service on a showing that management no longer
possesses confidence in his ability to perform the task entrusted to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even so, petitioner is not in a better
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of reinstatement
must stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correctly, the Comment of
the Solicitor General pointed out that there was no evidence that private
respondent had that status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The allegation that no dispute exists
as to the managerial status of private respondent is misleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is the records of the case [do] not
show that petitioner submitted any evidence to support its conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing as to whether private
respondent, as overseer, can lay down management policies, or whether he can
hire, fire, demote or promote or whether he can effectively recommend the
foregoing courses of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed up
to this stage, petitioner does not define the powers and duties of an overseer
in its company."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>
