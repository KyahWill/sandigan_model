				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This administrative case was initiated on <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1969</st1:date> upon complaint of Sergio F. <span class="GramE"><span style="">del</span></span><span style=""> </span>Castillo, <span style="">charging </span>Hon. Rafael C. <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>,
District Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, on three counts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>synthesis they are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that respondent intentionally <span style="">delayed </span>hearing a certain case for
partition (No. 94) filed in his court in 1962, because the lawyer for <span style="">the </span>defendants, who was <span style="">himself </span>one of them, was a friend of
his; (2) that <span style="">in </span>said case he <span style="">compelled the plaintiffs to mark their </span>documentary
evidence all <span style="">at </span>once and <span style="">indicate the pages of </span>the <span style="">record where </span>the documents were found
instead of having them formally <span style="">marked </span>and
presented individually in the course <span style="">of
the trial, </span>in accordance with <span style="">the
</span>customary procedure, and that because the marking consumed some time he
lost his patience and left the court, but continued to conduct the proceeding
by telephone; and (3) that he tried to coerce the plaintiffs to enter into a
compromise with the defendants although he knew there was no prospect that it
could <span style="">be </span>done, thus
unnecessarily delaying the disposal of the <span style="">case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge filed his answer to the complaint, after which
the <span style="">case was </span>assigned to Hon. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>, Associate
Justice of the Court of Appeals, for investigation, report and
recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing was held before
him on <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1969</st1:date>, at
which only complainant appeared and testified, respondent submitting the case
on the strength of his answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The report of Justice <span class="SpellE">Solidum</span>,
submitted on <st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1970</st1:date>,
contains the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"As to the first <span style="">charge
</span>that the respondent Judge deliberately delayed the trial of civil case
No. 94 because of his alleged friendship for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ibrado</span>, Sr., one of the attorneys for the defendants
and actually one of the defendants in said case, as they are both members of
the Rotary Club of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, the same has not been
sufficiently established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">There is </span>absolutely no proof to show
in what way the respondent had intentionally delayed the hearing of said case
simply because Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ibrada</span> and the respondent were
friends and members of the Rotary Club of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, in the memorandum filed by
the respondent, he <span style="">states </span>that
even before his receipt of the complaint in this administrative case, he had
resigned from the Rotary Club of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> because his
son was being considered for a scholarship grant by said club.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As to the second charge, the respondent in his memorandum admitted
that he abruptly adjourned the trial in the afternoon of February 14, 1967, but
the reason was because complainant, as counsel for plaintiffs, had indicated
that <span style="">he </span>had about 20 documents
to be marked and offered as evidence but when Atty. Castillo and the deputy
clerk started marking the exhibits after one hour, they made very little
progress as the record was voluminous; so respondent directed Atty. Castillo to
make use of the remaining time and proceed with the marking of the exhibits in
the presence of the deputy clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
undersigned does not find anything wrong with this procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, according to the respondent he
adjourned the hearing that afternoon at already <st1:time minute="25" hour="15">3:25
 o'clock</st1:time>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">With respect to </span>the <span style="">charge </span>that the respondent tried to
coerce <span style="">the plaintiffs </span>in the
said <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span> case to enter into a compromise with the
defendants knowing that there was absolutely no <span style="">prospect </span>for said compromise, thereby delaying <span style="">the proceeding of this </span>case, the
respondent readily admitted that considering <span style="">that </span><span style="">the parties in </span>said
civil case are close relatives, being brothers and <span style="">sisters, </span>he really exerted efforts to achieve such
compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This actuation of the
respondent Judge is not improper for as a matter of fact the law expressly
directs that litigants be advised and <span class="SpellE">counselled</span> to
compromise their mutual differences, especially when they are members of the
same family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 222, New Civil
Code)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may be mentioned that </span>according
to respondent the trial of the civil case No. <span style="">94 </span>was terminated on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1969</st1:date> and was then awaiting only the filing of the memoranda of
the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of the foregoing</b>, and as recommended by the
investigator, the <span style="">complaint is </span>dismissed
<span style="">and </span>respondent Judge is absolved
of the charges against him.</p>
