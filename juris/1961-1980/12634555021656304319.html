				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On October 9, 1956, Lot No. 6001, PLS-73, situated in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
and formerly part of the public domain, was declared by Executive Proclamation
No. 351, as land reserved for Municipal Site Purposes and withdrawn from sale
or settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Portions of said land
were then occupied by Rosario <span class="SpellE">Abragan</span>, Ramo­na <span class="SpellE">Pirales</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Apilado</span>, Ester <span class="SpellE">Apilado</span>, all for
resi­dential purposes, and by the <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>
Evangelical Church, for religious purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Years later, on August 29, 1961, the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, through Atty. <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
Valdez, Secretary to the Mayor, filed before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, a complaint for recovery of possession of the
above-stated land against said occupants after the latter had allegedly refused
repeated demands of the mu­nicipality for them to vacate the land so that the
same may be devoted to the purpose reserved by the proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants sought on September 18, 1961, to dis­miss the
complaint, alleging that it stated no cause of action because Executive
Proclamation No. 351 provides for compensation occupants for their
constructions; and that there was no allegation of any of offer or refusal of
compensation prior to the filing of the action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>De­fendants also claimed that the complaint should have been filed by
the Solicitor General or any attorney authorized by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court, on February 28, 1962, ruled that the com­plaint had a
sufficient cause of action and pointed out that the municipality could engage
its own counsel to file the case on its behalf.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 5, 1962, however, defendants filed a motion for
reconsideration citing a particular portion of the Proclamation which
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To protect and safeguard
the interests of certain occupants who in good faith have in­troduced
improvements in the reservation, the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>
shall make proper arrangements for the compen­sation and/or removal of said
improvements." These "ar­rangements for compensation" were
advanced as conditions precedent to the filing of the complaint and, since no
allegation of fulfillment of such conditions was made, defen­dants maintained
that the complaint did not state a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting thereon, the court of first instance dismissed the case on
the ground that the complaint did not allege the conditions precedent to the
enforcement of the Execu­tive Proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same court denied the plaintiff's urgent motion for reconsideration,
rejecting plaintiff's argument that the contents of the proclamation should not
have been considered, with the observation that the Presi­dential Proclamation
is a matter of which judicial notice may be taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals which in turn
certified the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on questions purely of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purely legal questions are on the sufficiency of the cause of
action alleged in the complaint and the pro­priety of the court's having taken
judicial notice of the Executive Proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a ground for dismissal, lack of a cause of action must appear
on the face of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thus
to determine whether a complaint states a cause of action, only facts alleged
in the complaint, and no other, should be considered.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The complaint at bar after citing the Executive Proclamation, alleges among
other things that:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the desire of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, to improve
and utilize Lot No. 6001, Pls-73, for the purpose for which it was legally
reserved, notices have been re­peatedly served on the above-named defendants to
vacate said premises, but said defendants re­peatedly and obstinately refused
to vacate said premises, the notices to that effect notwith­standing and they
still continue to refuse to vacate said lot."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We consider this to be a sufficient
allegation of a cause action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though not
alleging that offers for compensation had been made by the municipality,
paragraph two<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of the complaint sufficiently alleges that Executive Proclamation No. 351 had
reserved the land in question for Muni­cipal Park Site purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants' alleged right to compensation
under the proclamation is a matter for them to plead as a defense in their
answer and during the trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judicial notice of the proclamation was not an error on the part
of the court because Executive Proclamation <span class="GramE">are</span> among
the matters within judicial notice un­der Section 1, Rule 129 of the Rules of
Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
However, <span class="GramE">We</span> find it an error for the lower court to
have considered that the offer of payment was a condition precedent to the
enforceability of the proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cited portion of the proclamation does not speak only of compensation but adds
"and/or removal of said improvements", thereby indicating that
payment of compensation does not always have to take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for the defendants, therefore, to show
that they are entitled to compensation and recovery.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the dismissal order appealed from is here­by
reversed and the case is remanded to the lower court for further
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
