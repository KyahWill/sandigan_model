				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition filed by the San Miguel <span style="">Corporation </span>(formerly San Miguel Brewery, Inc.) for review of<span style=""> the decision of the Court of Industrial
Relations </span>(in <span style="">Case No.
2870-ULP), finding it guilty of unfair labor practices and ordering the
reinstatement with back wages of <span class="GramE">complainant</span> <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Cruz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case show that so the time in October, 1957
the "<span class="SpellE">Pagkakaisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Samahang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span>
S.M.B. (<span class="SpellE">Paflu</span>)", a labor organization in the San
Miguel corporation, staged a strike against the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After said strike ended and the strikers
resumed their work, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Cruz, a driver-employee
and member of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, was called by one Mr. <span class="SpellE">Camahort</span>, a company official, and was shown a news<span style="">paper clipping carrying a picture depicting
him (Cruz) as one of the strikers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Cruz, he was told by <span class="SpellE">Camahort</span>
that he would be dismissed if he would not desist from union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months thereafter, or on</span> <st1:date month="3" day="17" year="1958"><span style="">17 March
 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, Cruz was
advised of the company's decision to retire him from the service for physical
disability, </span>effective <st1:date month="3" day="11" year="1958">11 March
 1958</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Cruz must have already rec<span style="">e</span>ived
information thereof before it could be sent by the company because under date
of <st1:date month="3" day="15" year="1958">15 March 1958</st1:date> said
employee wrote the company re­questing that the benefits due him on account of
his retirement be given in only one installment.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, on <st1:date month="4" day="10" year="1958">10 April 1958</st1:date>,
Cruz received from the company HSBC Checks Nos. K905357 and K905358 in the
total sum of P3<span class="GramE">,019.46</span> as "full and complete
payment of all my (his) retirement benefits".<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="12" year="1958">12 June 1958</st1:date>,
Cruz also filed with the Social Security System an application for disability
benefit,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein he affirmed <span style="">having </span>retired
from employment on <st1:date month="3" day="31" year="1958">31 March 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim, however, was denied for the
reason that the case properly falls under sickness bene­fits, to which claimant
was not yet entitled, he having been a member of the System for less than one
year.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Three years after he <span style="">was
retired, on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="5"><span style="">27 May </span>1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span style="">Cruz </span>charged
the San Miguel Company before the Court of Industrial Relations with unfair
labor practices for his dismissal in 1958, allegedly for union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The formal complaint against the company was <span style="">filed by the Acting Prosecutor of the Court
on </span><st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1961"><span style="">12 October 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">
</span><span style="">(Case
No</span>. 2870-ULP).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the
trial Judge rendered decision <span style="">sus</span>taining
the charges and ordering therein respondent Company <span style="">to re</span>instate the complainant with back
wages, but deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the amounts already
received by him as retirement benefits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">company
</span>sought reconsideration thereof before the court <u>en banc</u>, and when
the same was denied on <st1:date month="6" day="5" year="1967">5 June 1967</st1:date>
(with two judges dissenting) the <span style="">present
petition for review was filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The primary question posed in this proceeding is whether <span style="">or not a </span>former employee who has
accepted retirement benefits <span style="">may still
contest </span>the regularity and validity of his retirement 3 years
thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In disposing of the company's defense of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
and <span style="">ruling that </span>the acceptance
by complainant of retirement benefits did not preclude the latter from
assailing the validity of the termination of his employment, the respondent
Court cited the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Cariño</u></span><u> vs.
Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein we said:</p>

<blockquote>"Acceptance of those benefits (separation pay and terminal
leave benefits) would not amount to <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is plain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Em­ployer and employee, obviously, do not
stand on the same footing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employer
drove the employee <span style="">to the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="">latter must have to get hold of money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Because, out of job, he had to face the harsh
necessities of life.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thus
found himself in no position to resist money <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His, then, is a case of adherence, not of
choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing sure, however, is that
petitioners did not relent on their claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They pressed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are deemed
not to have waived any of their rights."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above pronouncement relied upon by the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> is not controlling in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, as distinctly stated in
the <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> case, therein petitioners were improperly
dismissed and never relented in their efforts to assert the illegality of their
separa­tion from employment and to demand reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By contrast, the herein complainant not only
specified, and obtained, payment of retirement gratuities due him in a lump sum
but even applied for <u><span style="">disability</span></u><span style=""> </span>benefits with the Social Security
System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he never protested his
alleged illegal dismissal nor demanded reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took him more than 3 years to question the
validity of his said retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
original posture taken by the complainant, indeed, can be nothing but an
agreement, or at least acquiescence, to the decision of the company to have him
retired for physical disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
even assuming that there was ground to declare his separation from the service
invalid, complainant's receipt of all the benefits arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
with full knowledge of all the facts surrounding the same, amounts to waiver of
the right to contest the validity of the company's act.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the petitioner company's cause is not only premised on <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, but also on complainant's right having lapsed
into a stale demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, truly, all the
elements for the operation of the principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
are here present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) conduct on the
part of the employer that gave rise to the situation on which the complaint is
made, which is the retirement of the complainant for physical disability; (b)
delay in the assertion of complainant's right -- the lapsing of a period of 3
years which is neither explained nor justified; (c) lack of knowledge or notice
on the part of the respondent employer that the complainant would assert the
right on which the present suit is based; and (d) injury or prejudice to the
employer in the event relief is awarded to the complainant.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Herein private respondent tries to remove this case from the
opera­tion of the <span class="SpellE">laches</span> principle by alleging that
the matter of unfair labor practice involves public interest, and that the
Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act 875) did not prescribe any period within
which a right provided <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> may be
enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no quarrel on
this p<span style="">oint;
but it must be realized that, unlike prescription, </span><span style="">the defense </span><span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">laches</span></span><span style=""> is not dependent <span style="">on the existence of a statutory period of limitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be invoked without reckoning any
specific or fixed period; it is sufficient that there </span>be an unreasonable
and unexplained delay in bringing the action that its maintenance <span style="">would</span> <span style="">already </span>constitute inequity or injustice to the party claiming
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">this </span>Court succinctly declared in previous cases:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"- - - - -.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> is different from the statute of limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription is con­cerned with the fact of
delay, whereas <span class="SpellE">laches</span> is concerned with the effect of
delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription <span style="">is a matter of time; <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
is principally a question of inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced,
this inequity being founded on some change <span style="">in the </span>condition of the property or the relation of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription is statutory; <span class="SpellE">laches</span> is not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> applies in equity, whereas prescription applies at
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription is based on fixed
time; <span class="SpellE">laches</span> </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not." <span class="GramE">(Nielson &amp; Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
Consolidated Mining Co., L-21601, 17 December 1966).</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Laches</span> in <span style="">a </span>general sense, is failure or
neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, <span style="">to do that which, by exercising due
diligence, could or should have been done earlier, it is negligence or omission
to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the
party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or of 'stale
demands' is based upon grounds of public policy which requires, for the peace
of society, the discouragement of stale claims, and unlike the statute of
limitations, is not a mere question of time but is principally a question <span style="">of the inequity or unfairness of permitting a
right or claim to be enforced' or asserted." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> vs. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Si</span>bonghanoy</span>, L-21450, 15 April 1968).</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
