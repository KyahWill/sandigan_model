				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this case, the Manila court of first instance approved the petition
for naturalization of Pedro Co, a Chinese citizen married to Anita Linu
Its decision was in due time appealed by the Solicitor-General, whose
office questions the sufficiency of the qualifications of said
petitioner, sustaining the proposition, among others, that he had no
lucrative trade, profession or occupation.
  <p> It is admitted that for the past three years before the hearing, Pedro Co's average annual income was P2,320.00<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>
only. In the light of our decisions, he is deemed to have no lucrative
income, considering further that he has a wife to support.</p>
  <ol><li>Applicant, married, earning P400.00 a month, held to have no lucrative trade or occupation (Yu Kian Chie <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-20169, February 26,1965).
    
    <p> </p></li><li>Applicant, single, with P250.00 monthly income, denied naturalization for having no lucrative occupation (Uy <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-20799, November 29, 1965).
    
  <p> 
  </p></li><li>Applicant,
single, with P3,600.00 annual income, denied naturalization for having
no lucrative business, trade or occupation (Uy <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-20208, June 30, 1965).
    <p> </p></li><li>See also Yap <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-19649, April
  30, 1965,and Tan <em>vs</em>. Republic, L-20021, June 23,1965.
  </li></ol>  
<p><strong></strong>Wherefore, without passing on the other objections of the Republic's counsel, we hereby sustain this appeal, reverse the decision <em>a quo</em>, and deny the petition for naturalization. Costs against appellee.</p>
<em>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P.,</em>  and <em>Sanchez, JJ.,</em> concur.
