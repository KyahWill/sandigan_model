petitioners Simeon and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> who arrived on July
16.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of the admission of Dolores, Felix and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> was referred to the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1
which, on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1961</st1:date>,
after investigation, found Dolores <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> to be a Fi­lipino
citizen and Felix and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> to be her illegitimate
minor children by a Chinese national, <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Chong</span> Bing, and accord­ingly voted to admit them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a separate proceeding, the board found
Simeon and Ramon to be likewise the illegitimate children of Dolores <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> and likewise adjudged them entitled to be admitted as
Filipino citizens.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to section 27(b)<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, the decision admitting Dolores,
Felix and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> was forwarded for review to
the Board of Immigration Com­missioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record is not clear whether the decision with respect to Simeon and
Ramon was submitted to the board of com­missioners for review although all the
identification certificates issued to Felix, Manuel, Simeon and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> on September 1, 1961 explicitly and uniformly recite
that they had been admitted as "citizens of the Philippines as per
Decision of the Board of Spe­cial Inquiry No. 1 dated August 2, 1961 duly
affirmed by the majo­rity members of the Board of Commissioners."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1962</st1:date>,
the Secretary of Justice issued the following memorandum:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that for the past several years, the Board of
Commissioners of Immigration has not met collectively to discuss and deliberate
on the cas­es coming before it (Memorandum dated January 16, 1962 of the former
First Deputy Commissioner of Im­migration and the Memorandum dated January 19,
1962 of the Commissioner of Immigration), pursuant to the authority vested in
the Department Head by Section 79(c) of Act No. 2711, as amended, the public
interest so requiring, it is hereby ordered that all decisions purporting to
have been rendered by the Board of Com­missioners on appeal from, or on review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of,
decisions of the Board of Special Inquiry are set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Commissioners is directed to
review in accordance with Section 27(b) of Com­monwealth Act No. 613, as
amended, all decisions of the Board of Special Inquiry admitting entry of
aliens into the country and give preference to all cases where entry has been
permitted on the ground that the en­trant is a citizen of the Philippines,
following the prin­ciple laid down in Section 30 of Commonwealth Act 613, as
amended, that 'the burden of proof shall be upon such alien to establish that
he is not subject to exclu­sion' and the ruling of this Department that
'Citizenship is a status or privilege, power and honor of ines­timable
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When doubts exist concerning a
grant of it, they should be resolved in favor of the Go­vernment against the
claimant.' (1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>, <st1:date year="1947" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1947</st1:date>, from Secretary of Justice Roman <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span> to the Commissioner of Immigration.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears in fact that the immigration commissioners did not
deliberate as a board but merely acted individually on this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus Associate Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> and De la Rosa scribbled "noted" on the
decision while the chairman, Commis­sioner <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
wrote "exclude."</p>

<p class="BODY">So in August 1962 a new Board of Immigration Commission­ers
proceeded <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span>
to review the proceedings of the board of special inquiry with respect to
Dolores, Felix and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> and, finding that
they have not "satisfactorily established their claim to Philippine
citizenship," ordered them excluded "as aliens not properly
documented for admission pursuant to the provisions of section 29(a)(17) of the
Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, and returned to the port whence
they came or to the coun­try of which they are nationals." No review of
the board of special inquiry decision admitting the other petitioners Simeon
and Ramon was conducted, and it is now claimed that none could be made be­cause
the records of the case were missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>
the Commissioner of Immigration issued a warrant of arrest for the apprehension
and eventual deportation of the petitioners, the warrant stating:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it has been shown to the under­signed and the
undersigned is satisfied that DOLORES NERIA, 51, PIO, 22, FELIX, 15, MANUEL,
13, AL­FONSO, 27, VICTOR, 26, JUAN, 16, SIMEON, 24, and RAMON, 17, all surnamed
NERIA, is [<u>sic</u>] a citi­zen or subject of the Republic of China who is
now in the Philippines;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it has also been shown to the un­dersigned and the
undersigned is satisfied that the above-named aliens is [<u>sic</u>] subject to
deportation un­der Section 37(a)(1) and 37(a)(2) of the Philippine Im­migration
Act of 1940, as amended, in view of the following facts and circumstances:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That being Chinese aliens not lawfully admis­sible to this
country, on the basis of a cablegram bear­ing the signature of the Secretary of
Foreign Affairs <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> M. Serrano, by false
statements and testi­monies, they succeeded in securing documentation as
Filipino citizens and were able to gain entry into this country as Filipino
citizens by means of said fraudul­ently obtained documentations and by false
and misleading statements and misrepresentations, they be­ing aliens not
properly documented for admission; that as to Dolores <span class="SpellE">Neria</span>,
she gained entry on the false and fictitious claim that she was born in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on January 14 or
15, 1914, as the alleged child of Juan <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eladia</span> R. Pedro and the rest of the above-named persons
were claimed as the illegitimate children of Dolores <span class="SpellE">Neria</span>
by her common law husband, <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Chong</span>
Bing, a Chinese who was not married, to her, said claim being false.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the autho­rity vested in the
undersigned by law, you are hereby commanded to apprehend the above-named alien
[<u>sic</u>] said to be residing at wherever found and to bring him [<u>sic</u>]
before the undersigned for the said alien to show [<u>sic</u>] cause, if any
there be, why he [<u>sic</u>] should not be deported from the Philippines under
the provi­sions of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> therefore filed
these cases for certiorari and prohibition in the Court of First Instance of
Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
They charged that the new Board of Immigration Commissioners acted without or
in excess of its jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion in reversing
the decision of August 2, 1961 of the board of special inquiry because the said
decision had by then be­come final, one year having elapsed from the date it
was promul­gated Consequently, it was claimed that as their status as Fili­pinos
had finally been settled by the decision of the board of spe­cial inquiry, the
warrant of arrest issued by the Immigration Com­missioner was illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer the respondents claimed that the petitioners
succeeded in gaining entry into the country on the strength of a ca­blegram
purportedly sent to the Philippine Consulate in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs; that the decision of the board of special
inquiry had not been validly affirmed by the first Board of Immigration
Commissioners as the members thereof did not deliberate <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
on the matter but merely acted thereon indivi­dually, two members indicating
that they had "noted" the decision under review, while the chairman
voted to "exclude" the petitioners; that there having been no prior
valid review, the new Board of Immigration Commissioners could lawfully revoke
the decision of the board of special inquiry; that even assuming that the pre­vious
review was valid, there is nothing in the law precluding a new Board of
Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioners from
reversing its prior decision provided it does so within one year from the
promulgation of the decision under review; and that decisions of immigration
authorities do not constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> so as to bar re-examina­tion of the alien's
right to enter or to stay.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1966</st1:date>
the lower court rendered judgment set­ting aside the decision of the new Board
of Commissioners as Well as the warrant of arrest issued by the Immigration
Commissioner for lack of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court found that at the time the new
Board of Immigration Commissioners promulgated its decision reversing that of
the board of special inquiry, the one-year period provided in section 27(b) of
the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 had expired, because while the revers­ing
decision appears to be dated August 2, 1962 it was in point of fact promulgated
On August 8, 1962 and that the latter date was changed to August 2, 1962 to
make the decision conform to section 27(b).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court likewise held that it was error for the new board to proceed
with the review without previously notifying the parties because "<span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> review" does
not mean "ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> review."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents appealed to this Court,</p>

<p class="BODY">As we have already stated these cases were tried in the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> on the issue of whether the new Board of Commissioners had the power
to review the decision of the board of special inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the companion case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Pio</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Neria</span> v. Commissioner of Immigration</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></u></span></a>
(which arose out of the same facts involved in the present cases), we found
that the decision of the Board of Commissioners, reversing that of the board of
special inquiry; was actually promulgated on August 8, 1962 and not on August
2, 1962 as pretended, and for that reason we held that "The said decision
of the Board of Immigration Commissioners, and the warrant of exclusion issued
on the strength of such decision, are therefore, as correctly found by the
lower court, null and void, for 'lack of jurisdiction,' since the decision of
the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1 by that time had already become
'final.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, it would seem sufficient to base <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the lower court's decision in these cases now
before us on the authority of the other <span class="SpellE"><u>Neria</u></span>
case, since all these cases arose out of the same facts and were decided on the
same theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The res­pondents now claim,
however, that the warrant of arrest was is­sued not in consequence of the
decision of the new Board of Immi­gration Commissioners but rather on grounds
warranting the de­portation of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise stated, the argument is that the warrant of arrest was issued
not under the authority of section 427(b) but under section 37(a)(1) and (2)<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact the respondents confidently assert in their brief that it is
immaterial whether or not the decision of the new Board of Immigration
Commissioners is valid because "Precisely, the warrant of arrest ... was
issued premised on the assumption (because petitioners had assailed in other
cases the validity of said decision [see G.R. L-24800]) that exclusion
proceedings had lapsed on the expiration of the one-year period prescribed
under Section 27(b) of the Immigration Act of 1940, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is but proper to commence
deportation proceedings under Section 37 of the same law, complementing Section
27(b)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents' present stance involves a complete change of
theory, which, of course, is not permissible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, while they went to trial in the lower court below on the theory
that the warrant was issued to implement and carry out the decision of the new
Board of Commissioners finding the petitioners to be aliens and that the
decision of the new Board was valid because it was ren­dered within a year of
the promulgation of the decision of the board of special inquiry which it
sought to reverse, it is now the respon­dents' contention that the validity of the
new Board's decision is immaterial because the warrant of arrest was issued not
in consequence of that decision but rather of contemplated deportation
proceedings against the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, what was expressly and unequivocally found by this
Court in the other <span class="SpellE"><u>Neria</u></span> case to be a warrant
of exclusion is now in effect sought to be nullified as it is now claimed that
the said warrant was actually a warrant of arrest because the case of the
present petitioners is not one for exclusion but for deportation, and that the
arrest of the petitioners in these cases as well as the petitioner in the other
<span class="SpellE"><u>Neria</u></span> case was sought in one and the same
warrant and not in different ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents now point to the recitals of the warrant to support their contention
that it was is­sued under the authority of section 37 on deportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what of our finding in the other <span class="SpellE"><u>Neria</u></span> case?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already stated, these cas­es at bar arose out of the same facts as
the other <span class="SpellE"><u>Neria</u></span> case and so our ruling in the
latter case must be deemed to be the law of the present cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">But there is a more fundamental and insurmountable objec­tion to
the respondents' new theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is that
no warrant of arrest can be issued by immigration authorities before a final
order of deportation is made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For until
it is established that an alien law­fully admitted gained entry into the
country through illegal means and his expulsion is finally decreed, his arrest
cannot be ordered.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court explicitly said in <u>Vivo vs. <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span></u>,
supra:</p>

<blockquote>"[T]he issuance of warrants of arrest
by the Commis­sioner of Immigration, solely for purposes of inves­tigation and
before a final order of deportation is is­sued, conflicts with paragraph 3,
Section 1, of Arti­cle III (Bill of Rights) of our Constitution, providing:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of the
people to be se­cure in their persons, houses, papers and ef­fects against
unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall
issue but upon probable cause, to be de­termined by the judge after examination
under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce,
and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things
to be seized.'</p>

<blockquote>"It will be noted that the power to determine probable cause
for warrants of arrest is limited by the Philippine Constitution to judges
exclusively, unlike the previous organic laws and the Federal Cons­titution of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that left undetermined which public officials could determine the existence of
probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in Qua <span class="SpellE">Chee</span> <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>, et al. vs. Deportation
Board, L-20280, promulgated on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9">Sep­tember
 30, 1963</st1:date>, this Court pointed out that Execu­tive Order No. 69, of <st1:date year="1947" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1947</st1:date>, issued by Pre­sident <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, in prescribing the procedure for deportation of
aliens, only required the filing of a bond by an alien under investigation, but
did not authorize his arrest.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"Discussing the
implications of the provision of our Bill of Rights on the issuance of
administra­tive warrants of arrest, this Court said in the same case:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">"'Under the express terms of our
Constitution it is, therefore, even doubtful whether the ar­rest of an
individual may be ordered by any authority other than the judge if the purpose
is merely to determine the existence of a pro­bable cause, leading to an
administrative investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Constitution does not distin­guish between warrants in a criminal case and
administrative warrants in administrative pro­ceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if one suspected of having com­mitted a
crime is entitled to a determination of the probable cause against him, by a
judge, why should one suspected of a violation of an administrative nature
deserve less guarantee?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course it is
different if the order of arrest is issued to carry out a final finding of a
viola­tion, either by an executive or legislative offi­cer or agency duly
authorized for the purpose, as then the warrant is not that mentioned in the
Constitution which is <span class="SpellE">issuable</span> only on pro­bable
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such, for example, would be a
warrant of arrest to carry out a final order of deportation, or to effect
compliance of an or­der of contempt.</p>

<p class="2Q">"'The contention of the Solicitor Gene­ral that the arrest of
a foreigner is necessary to Carry into effect the power of deportation is valid
only when, as already stated, there is al­ready an order of deportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To carry out the order of deportation, the
President obviously has the power to order the arrest of the de­portee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, certainly during the investiga­tion, it
is not indispensable that the alien be arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough, as was true before the
executive order of President <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>, that a bond be
required to insure the appearance of the alien during the investigation, as was
authorized in the executive order of Pre­sident <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>.'</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align: center;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<blockquote>"We see no reason why the cautionary bond requirement of the
1947 Executive Order No. 69 of President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> should
not apply to deportation pro­ceedings initiated by the Immigration Commission­ers,
considering the identity of ends sought to be served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such notice and bonds should suffice to en­sure
the subjects appearance at the hearings, with­out prejudice to more drastic
measures in case of recalcitrant respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>But as long as the illegal entry or offense of the respondents has
not yet been established and their expulsion finally decided upon, their arrest
upon administrative warrant violates the provisions of our Bill of Rights</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitu­tional guarantees of individual
liberty must be libe­rally construed and applied if we are to enjoy the
blessings of a regime of justice, liberty and demo­cracy that the Philippine
Constitution sought to se­cure and consolidate." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>
