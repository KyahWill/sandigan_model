				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J. B. L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal by the accused from an order of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, in its Criminal Case No. 5243 (for
serious physical injuries and damage to property through reckless imprudence),
overruling a motion to quash on the ground of double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stripped to essentials, the case arose in this wise:</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused was driving a passenger bus of the La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span> Company on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="7">July
 23, 1962</st1:date>, along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>
  Highway</st1:address></st1:street> in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Guiguinto</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Allegedly because of his neg­ligence and recklessness, the vehicle
driven by him struck and collided with the passenger jeep of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Lumidao</span>, damaging said jeep and causing it to turn turtle,
and injuring its passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six of the
latter suffered slight physical injuries requiring medical attendance for 5 to
9 days; three other riders came out with serious bodily injuries that needed
medical attention for 30 to 45 days; while the jeep was damaged to the extent
of P1<span class="GramE">,395.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A charge was filed against the accused-appellant, one for slight
physical injuries through reckless imprudence, in the Justice of the Peace
Court of <span class="SpellE">Guiguinto</span>, for which he was tried and
acquitted on <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to this acquittal, however, the
Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> filed in the Court of
First Instance the information in the case now before us, for serious physical
injuries, and damage to property through reckless imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, both charges referred to the same
highway collision.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the accused was arraigned in the Court of First Instance,
his counsel moved to quash the charges on the ground that he had already been
acquitted of the same offense by the Justice of the Peace Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution opposed the motion and the
Court denied the motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unable
to secure reconsideration, the accused appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sole issue before us, therefore, is whether the second case
placed the appellant twice in jeopardy for the same offense, and is barred by
the previous acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellant that the Court below erred in not
dismissing the information for "serious physical injuries and damage to
property through reckless imprudence," in view of the appellant's previous
acquittal by the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Guiguinto</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, for the same imprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reason and precedent both coincide in that once convicted or
acquitted of a specific act of reckless imprudence, the accused may not be
prosecuted again for that same act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the essence of the quasi offense of criminal negligence under article 365 of
the Revised Penal Code lies in the execution of an imprudent or neg­ligent act
that, if intentionally done, would be punishable as a felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law penalizes thus the negligent or
careless act, not the result thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The gravity of the consequence is only taken into account to determine
the penalty; it does not qualify the subs­tance of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as the careless act is single, whether
the injurious result should affect one person or several persons, the offense
(criminal negligence) remains one and the same, and can not be split into different
crimes and prosecutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has been
the constant ruling of the Spanish Supreme Court, and is also that of this
Court in its most recent decisions on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Thus, in <u>People vs. Silva</u>, G.R. No.</span>
L-15974, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>,
where as a result of the same vehicular accident one man died, two persons were
seriously injured while another three suffered only slight physical injuries,
we ruled that the acquittal al a charge of slight physical injuries through
reckless <span class="GramE">imprudence,</span> was a bar to another Prosecution
for homicide through reckless imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">In <u>People</u> vs. Diaz, G.R. No.</span> L-6518,
March 30, 1954, the ruling pas that the dismissal by the Municipal Court of a
charge of reckless driving barred a second information of Damage to Property
Through Reckless Imprudence based on the same negligent act of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Belga</span></u>, 100 Phil. 996, dismissal of an information for
physical injuries through reckless imprudence as a result of a collision
between two automobiles was declared to block two other prosecutions, one for
damage to property through reckless imprudence aid another for mul­tiple
physical injuries arising from the same collision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same doctrine was reasserted in <u>Yap
vs. <span class="SpellE">Lutero</span> et al</u>., G.R. No. L-12669, <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In none of the oases cited did the Supreme
Court regard as material that the various offenses charged for the same
occurrence were <span class="SpellE">triable</span> in Courts of differing
category, or that the complainants were not the same individuals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As for the Spanish jurisprudence, <span class="SpellE">Cuello</span> <span class="SpellE">Calon</span>, in his <span class="SpellE"><u>Derecho</u></span><u> Penal</u> (12th Ed.), Vol.</span> I, p.

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General stresses in his brief that the charge for
slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence could not be joined with
the accusation for serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence,
because Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code allows only the <span class="SpellE">complexing</span> of grave or less grave felonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This same argument was considered and
rejected by this Court in the case of <u>People vs. Diaz</u>, <u>supra:<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution's contention might be true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But neither was the prosecution obliged to first prosecute the accused
for slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence before pressing the
more serious charge of homicide with serious physical in­juries through
reckless imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having first
prosecuted the defendant for the lesser offense in the Justice of the Peace
Court of <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
which acquitted the defendant, the prosecuting attorney is not now in a
position to press in this case the more serious charge of homicide with serious
physical in­juries through reckless imprudence which arose out of the same
alleged reckless imprudence of which the defendant has been previously cleared
by the inferior court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, we must perforce rule that the exonera­tion
of this appellant, Jose <span class="SpellE">Buan</span>, by the Justice of the
Peace (now Municipal) Court of <span class="SpellE">Guiguinto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, of the charge of slight physical injuries through
reckless imprudence, prevents his being prosecuted for serious physical
injuries through reckless imprudence in the Court of First Instance of the
province, where both charges are derived from the consequences of one and the
same vehicular accident, because the second accusation places the appellant in
second jeopardy for the same offense.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is reversed, and the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> is directed to
quash and dismiss the charge in its Criminal Case No. 5243.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
