				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 15, 1958 Benigno Musni and others filed a complaint with the 
Secretary of Public Works and Communications against Ricardo M. Gutierrez 
alleging therein, inter alia, that the latter had illegally constructed dams, 
dikes and other obstructions across navigable waters, waterways, rivers and 
communal fishing grounds located in Barrio San Esteban, Macabebe, Pampanga. They 
prayed that, pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 2056, the said 
obstructions be ordered removed or destroyed. The original complaint was 
subsequently amended by adding six more to the streams or waterways mentioned 
therein.
<p>On December 13, 1958 Gutierrez filed a motion to dismiss the complaint upon 
the ground that the proceedings to be held before Julian C. Cargullo, the 
investigator appointed by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, 
would be void because Republic Act 2056 was unconstitutional as it conferred 
judicial powers to the Secretary of Public Works and Communications. This motion 
was denied and the investigator set the case for hearing on December 19 and 20, 
1958.</p>
<p>On December 15, 1958 Gutierrez filed with the Court of First Instance of 
Pampanga a petition for prohibition—which was subsequently amended twice—against 
the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, Florencio Moreno, the 
Department investigator, Julian C. Cargullo, Senator Rogelio de la Rosa, Benigno 
Musni and his complainants, to prevent the carrying out of the investigation 
referred to above. Main contentions of petitioner were: <i>firstly</i>, that Act 
2506 was unconstitutional because it granted judicial powers to the Secretary of 
Public Works and Communications, and <i>secondly</i>, that the nature and 
character of the streams and waterways subject of the complaint lodged with the 
Department of Public Works and Communications was already <i>res judicata</i> 
having been the subject of an agreement between the Zobel Family—former owners 
of petitioner's fishponds, and the Municipality of Macabebe. Said case was 
docketed as Civil Case No. 1520 and was assigned by lottery to Branch I of said 
court, presided by the Hon. Arsenio Santos.</p>
<p>The Secretary of Public Works and Communications and the Department 
Investigator filed their answer to the petition for prohibition alleging therein 
several affirmative defense. Respondent Rogelio de la Rosa adopted said answer 
<i>in toto</i> as his own, while the other respondents filed a separate pleading 
invoking virtually the same defense pleaded by their co-parties.</p>
<p>On February 25, 1959 respondent de la Rosa filed a motion to disqualify the 
Hon. Arsenio Santos from trying and deciding the case, upon the ground that 
sometime in 1948 he had acted as counsel for fishpond owners, like the 
petitioner Gutierrez, in an administrative investigation involving the same or 
at least similar issues and properties, and had expressed views in the course of 
said investigation prejudicial or adverse to the contention of the respondents 
in the pending case. Petitioner Gutierrez objected to the motion aforesaid upon 
the ground that there was no legal ground upon which Judge Santos could be 
disqualified under the provisions of Rule 126 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>After due hearing on the matter, the respondent Judge issued an order dated 
April 15, 1959 disqualifying himself and endorsing the case to the Second Branch 
of the court, for reasons stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Meanwhile, the new respondent, in his motion dated February 24, 1959, is 
seeking the disqualification of the presiding judge from sitting in the instant 
case on the ground that, before his appointment to the bench, he has been 
counsel for some fishpond owners, "like petitioner herein", as evidenced by 
photostatic copies of two (2) communications, annex A and annex B (par. 2 of the 
motion); and that under section 1, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court, "no judge 
shall sit in a case in which he has been a counsel" (par. 4, same motion).</p>
<p>The motion is being objected to by the petitioner for reasons stated in his 
written opposition dated March 14, 1959. A perusal of the legal provisions, 
invoked by said respondent, does not show that the presiding judge is included 
in any of their prohibitions, because he is not pecuniarily interested in the 
case; he is not related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity 
or affinity; he has not been an executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, or 
<i>counsel</i>; neither has he presided in any inferior court, whose ruling or 
decision being the subject of review (sec. 1, Rule 126, <i>supra</i>).</p>
<p>It is true that while in the practice of law as a member of a law firm, the 
presiding judge, in behalf of Roman Santos, Manuel Borja and heirs of Proceso de 
Guzman, wrote the then Secretary of the Interior a letter dated June 1, 1948, 
annex A of the motion, requesting that the proposed lease, in public bidding, of 
certain streams listed in resolution No.26, series of 1948 of the municipal 
council of Macabebe, Pampanga be held in abeyance until after the Committee on 
Rivers and Streams, created under Administrative Order No. 32 issued by the 
President of the Philippines, would have determined their nature, whether 
private or public.</p>
<p>But, nowhere in the letters, annex A and annex B, could be found any showing 
that the presiding judge has ever appeared as counsel for Ricardo Gutierrez, the 
herein petitioner, contrary to the contention of the respondent, Senator Rogelio 
de la Rosa. Had he been his counsel, the presiding judge should have 
disqualified himself from sitting in the present case even without a motion, as 
he did in a case pending in the second branch of this court, wherein Manuel 
Borja is the petitioner.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the petition, annex 1 of the re-amended petition, filed 
by Benigno Musni and others on August 15, 1958, they stated that the respondents 
named therein, one of them being Ricardo Gutierrez, "constructed dams, dikes and 
other works in public navigable waters, waterways, rivers and communal fishing 
grounds in the municipality of Macabebe, Pampanga"; and that such navigable 
waters, waterways, rivers and communal fishing grounds are those specified in 
the list, annex A of the said petition, annex 1 of the re-amended petition.</p>
<p>A reading of this list shows that some of the streams mentioned in Resolution 
No. 26, series of 1948 of the municipal council of Macabebe, Pampanga, included 
in the fishponds of Roman Santos, Manuel Borja and heirs of Proceso de Guzman, 
were the ones, which the presiding judge, then law practitioner, contended in 
his letrter, annex A of the motion, to be <i>private</i> and not public; and 
that the said streams, as shown by the plan, Exhibit A—De la Rosa, were more or 
less similar to those included in the fishpond or fishponds of the petitioner, 
Ricardo Gutierrez, which were being investigated by Mr. Julian C. Cargullo, upon 
order of the respondent Secretary of Public Works and Communications.</p>
<p>Such being the case, the presiding judge is inclined to grant the motion by 
disqualifying himself to sit in this case, not because he has been a counsel for 
the above named petitioner, which is entirely false, neither because of 
"extremada delicadeza", but because his opinion given in the aforesaid letter 
might, some way or another, influence on his decision in the case at bar. While 
this would be a too remote possibility, yet it is the duty of the court to 
administer justice without any suspicion of bias and prejudice, otherwise a 
party-litigant might lose confidence in the judiciary that must be avoided as 
much as possible for the purpose of preserving its dignity."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner Gutierrez filed a motion for the reconsideration of the order 
mentioned above, but the respondent Judge denied said motion in his order of 
August 11, 1959 where the following is stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While it is true that presiding judge was not counsel for the petitioner, 
yet in his letter dated June 1, 1949, attached to the record, as then a private 
law practitioner and as counsel for Manuel Borja, Roman Santos and the heirs of 
Proceso de Guzman, he informed the then Secretary of Interior that the streams 
and rivers, intended to be leased at public auction by the municipal council of 
Macabebe, Pampanga, in its Resolution No. 26, were private and not public.</p>
<p>In his same letter, the presiding judge even stated that copies of Resolution 
No. 26 were furnished the persons mentioned therein, one of them being Ricardo 
Gutierrez, the herein petitioner, because the streams and rivers subject of the 
instant petition were among those to be leased. In other words, the interests of 
Manuel Borja, Roman Santos and the heirs of Proceso de Guzman were identical to 
the interests of the herein petitioner Ricardo Gutierrez, so much so that 
whatever may be the resolution of the Secretary of the Interior then would 
benefit the interests of the said petitioner.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the presiding judge believes that he has no other 
recourse but to disqualify himself from sitting in this case."</p></blockquote>
<p>On August 22, 1959 Gutierrez commenced the present action for mandamus 
against the Hon. Arsenio Santos, the Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, the Department Investigator and the parties who filed the 
complaint against him, for the purpose of compelling the aforesaid Judge "to 
proceed, continue with the hearing and take cognizance of Civil Case No. 1520 of 
the Court of First Instance of Pampanga."</p>
<p>Petitioner, invoking the provisions of section 1, Rule 126 of the Rules of 
Court, argues that the case of the respondent Judge does not fall under any one 
of the grounds for the disqualification of judicial officers stated therein. 
Assuming arguendo that a literal interpretation of the legal provision relied 
upon justifies petitioner's contention to a certain degree, it should not be 
forgotten that, in construing and applying said legal provision, we cannot 
disregard its true intention nor the real ground for the disqualification of a 
judge or judicial officer, which is the impossibility of rendering an impartial 
judgment upon the matter before him. It has been said, in fact, that due process 
of law requires a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal, and 
that every litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an 
impartial judge (30 Am. Jur. p. 767). Moreover, second only to the duty of 
rendering a just decision, is the duty of doing it in a manner that will not 
arouse any suspicion as to its fairness and the integrity of the Judge. 
Consequently, we take it to be the true intention of the law—stated in general 
terms—that no judge shall preside in a case in which he is not wholly free, 
disinterested, impartial and independent (30 Am. Jur. <i>Supra</i>) because—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * However upright the judge, and however free from the slightest 
inclination but to do justice, there is peril of his unconscious bias or 
prejudice, or lest any former opinion formed ex parte may still linger to affect 
unconsciously his present judgment, or lest he may be moved or swayed 
unconsciously by his knowledge of the facts which may not be revealed or stated 
at the trial, or cannot under the rules of evidence. No effort of the will can 
shut out memory; there is no art of forgetting. We cannot be certain that the 
human mind will deliberate and determine unaffected by that which it knows, but 
which it should forget in that process." * * * (Ann. Cas. 1917A, p. 
1235)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the present case the respondent, judge himself has candidly stated that 
the opinion expressed by him in a letter dated June 1, 1948 addressed by him as 
counsel for Manuel Borja and others to the then Secretary of the Interior, 
attached to the motion for disqualification as Annex A, "might, some way or 
another, influence (on) his decision in the case at bar" (order of April 13, 
1959). The fear he has thus expressed—of not being able to render a truly 
impartial judgment—does not appear to be capricious and whimsical, having in 
mind particularly that in his order of August 11, 1959 denying petitioner's 
motion for reconsideration, His Honor reiterated that in the aforesaid, letter 
he informed the Secretary of the Interior that the streams and rivers to be 
auctioned, for lease purposes, by the municipal council of Macabebe, Pampanga, 
were private and not public streams and rivers; that the streams and rivers 
subject of the petition for prohibition filed by herein petitioner were among 
those that he considered as <i>private</i> in nature; that, therefore, the 
interests of Borja and his other clients "were identical to the interests of the 
herein petitioner etc." In view of these circumstances, we are constrained to 
agree with His Honor that the opinion thus expressed by him years ago "might, 
some way or another, influence his decision" in the case before him.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition for mandamus under consideration is hereby denied, 
without costs.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Paredes, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
