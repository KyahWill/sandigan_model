				<H3>ISABEL AGDEPPA, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE VIRGILIO SY JAVIER OF STA. PRAXEDES, CAGAYAN, RESPONDENT.<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The commitment of the judiciary to the ideal of justice impartially
administered, in reality as well as in appearance, is a truism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When municipal judges were allowed to
practice, it was not unreasonable to harbor the suspicion that their appearance
before other municipal courts could in close cases tilt the balance in their
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence the
directive of the Department of Justice prohibiting them from practicing therein.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the non-observance thereof by Judge <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Javier of Sta. <span class="SpellE">Praxedes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> that was the
basis of an administrative complaint against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out that on several occasions,
after his appointment as such municipal judge, respondent appeared as counsel
for the accused <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Dascil</span>
in a preliminary investigation for a murder charge in Criminal Case No. 688,
pending before the municipal court of Sanchez Mira, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was vigorous opposition on such
appearance on the part of the counsel for complainant but respondent
persisted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint against the
accused therein was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then referred for investigation to District Judge <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Savellano</span> of the
Court of First Instance of Sanchez Mira, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, with both complainant and
respondent being duly heard, he submitted his report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stressed therein that the high regard of
the public for the judiciary would be minimized if judges failed to obey
circulars intended to "strengthen <span style="">the
people's abiding faith" in judicial impartiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There </span>could be <span class="GramE">an
erosion</span> thereof if one municipal judge can appear before another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rightfully, the suspicion may be entertained
that the sense of fraternity among the men on the bench may influence the
disposition of cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he
recommended that respondent be admonished.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such recommendation of mere admonition is, however, according to
our Judicial Consultant, too mild a penalty considering the rather defiant
attitude exhibited by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
impress upon him the seriousness of the infraction, it is his submission that
respondent be censured and reprimanded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a recommendation meets with our approval.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Javier is censured for his failure to obey and respect
the Department of Justice circular prohibiting municipal judges from appearing
for party litigants in municipal courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this resolution be spread on his record.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
<span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
Jr., <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
