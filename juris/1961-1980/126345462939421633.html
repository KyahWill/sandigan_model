				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In their amended petition (complaint) filed on October 5, 1961 in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gestosani</span> and more than
thirty other persons prayed "that, after proper hearing of this petition,
an order be issued annulling Transfer Certificate of Titled No. TT-9810; order­ing
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> to cancel said Certifi­cate
of Title; declaring the land in question to have been acquired by acquisitive
prescription by herein petitioners; and as an alternative, to declare said land
as part of the public domain in which case petitioners be given preferential
rights to the same; condemning the respondent, Insular De­velopment Company,
Inc., to pay petitioners damages in the form of litigation expenses in the
total amount of P5,000.00, and such other remedies which may be found just and
proper in the premises".</p>

<p class="BODY">Basic allegations made in the abovementioned pleading are the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">That on February 1, 1957 the Commissioner of the Land
Registration Commission issued a certification to the effect that the records
of his office covering the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City Ca­dastral Case
No. 1, LRC Cadastral Record No. 317 showed that Lot No. 512 of the Cadastral
Survey of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> was subdivided into Lots Nos. 1926
and 1927, the first being the <span class="SpellE">subjectmatter</span> of their
amended petition; that Decree<i> </i>No. 764871 was issued for said lot on
December 13, 1945, while the corresponding certificate of title was released on
December 18 of the same year; that the original and copy of said decree and of
the decision relative to Lot No. 1926 were not among the records salvaged by
the office of the Land Registration Commission; that <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the fact that decree No. 764871, the certificate of title issued pursuant
thereto and the decision rendered in the registration pro­ceedings had not been
reconstituted, another decree numbered N-79289 was issued for the lot
aforementioned on September 7, 1960, as a result of which, on September 29 of
the same year<i> </i>the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City issued Original Certificate of Title No. 140 in the name<i> </i>of Maria
F. Villa <span class="SpellE">Abrille</span>; that on the same day the Register
of Deeds can­celled said original certificate of title and issued, in lieu
thereof, Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-9314 in the name of the Insular
Development Company, Inc.; that as a result of a written communication sent on
October 26, 1966 by the latter to the Commissioner of the Land Registration
Commission inviting attention to certain discrepancies in the technical
description appearing on Transfer Certificate Title No. T-9314, on the one
hand, and the duly approved technical description of the property <span class="SpellE">subjectmatter</span> there­of, on the other, said Commissioner
submitted a report to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
suggesting that the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> be
ordered to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-9314 and issue another in
lieu thereof<b> </b>containing the correct technical description; that said
report having been approved by the Court, Transfer Certificate of<b> </b>Title
No.<b> </b>T-9314 was cancelled and in lieu thereof Transfer Certificate of
Title No. TT-9810 in the name of Insular Development Company, Inc. was issued
on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing, the petitioners claimed that the issuance
of Decree No. N-79289 and of the original are transfer certificates of titles
mentioned heretofore was fraudulent and illegal and, therefore, null and void;
that being the <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span> occupants of the parcel of
land covered by said decree and certificates of title and having cultivated the
land since time immemorial, through themselves and their predecessors in
interest, they were thereby "deprived of their ownership and their lawful
interest to the land and its improvements" and had suffered damages in the
amount of P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1961</st1:date>,
after having been duly summoned, the Insular Development Company, Inc. filed
the following motion to dismiss:</p>

<blockquote>"Defendant Insular Development Company, Inc., by counsel,
respectfully moves to dismiss the 'amended petition’ on the follo­wing grounds:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 88.65pt; text-indent: -23.85pt;">‘(1) <span class="GramE">The</span> present action is barred by another action pending
between the same parties for the same cause.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 88.65pt; text-indent: -23.85pt;">‘(2) The cause of
action is barred by the statute of limita­tions.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 88.65pt; text-indent: -23.85pt;">‘(3) The petition
does not state a cause of action.’”</p>

<p class="BODY">During the preliminary hearing held in connection with the motion
to dismiss, the herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> presented in
evidence, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><u>,</u> certified
true copies of the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> of <u>June</u> <u>12,</u> <u>1930</u> in Cadastral
Case No. 1, G.L.R.O. Record No. 317; of the decision of the Supreme Court dated
November 14, 1931 in the aforesaid case, and a certificate issued by the Clerk
of Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> to the effect that the final
judgment ren­dered in said registration proceeding had become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1962</st1:date>
the lower court sustained the above reproduced motion and dismissed the case in
an order of the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the
present action is barred by another action pending between the parties; the
cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations; and that the petition
does not state a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs opposed the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a perusal of the motion to dismiss and the opposition
thereto the Court is of the opinion that the motion to dismiss is
well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs based their right
to bring this action on the fact that they are occupants of the pro­perty in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claimed the land in
question to be public land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As mere
occupants of the land in question and without any claim of proprietary interest
they may not bring an action for the annulment of the certificate of title
covering the land in litigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, there is a pending action between the same parties or some of
them over the same property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In a decision in CA-G.</span> R. No. 22856-R entitled Insular Development
Company, Inc., vs. <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cunanan</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> et al. will be
applicable in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this case is hereby ordered dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal the petitioners claim that the order of
dismissal should be reversed and the case remanded to the court a quo for trial
on the merits, upon the ground that said court erred in holding:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, that they have no right to bring an
action for the annulment of the cer­tificate of title covering the land in
litigation; secondly, that there is a pending action between the petitioners or
some of them, on the one hand, and the defendant, on the other, over the same
property; and finally, in dismissing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues set forth above seem to be of secondary
importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point that is really
decisive on the question of whether appellants’ action can stand, and whether
any other person can raise in court the issues covered by their amended
petition (complaint) is whether or not the title issued originally to Maria F.
Villa <span class="SpellE">Abrille</span> and subsequently the subject of several
conveyances until it was acquired by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> cor­poration
can still be annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pending action involving the same parties and the same
property mentioned in the motion to dismiss was Civil Case No. 1503 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> which at the time of
the filing of said motion was already on appeal in the Court of Appeals (C.A.G.
R. No. 22856-R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was decided by the
latter on <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An attempt made by the therein defendants to
have the latter decision - affirm­ing that of the lower court - reviewed by <span class="GramE">Us</span> by certiorari failed (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-26482,
dismissed on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="10"><span class="GramE">October
 7, 1966</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, it became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint filed - on December 29, 1954, or seven years prior
to the filing of the instant case – in the action mentioned above alleged that
the Insular Development Company, Inc. was the owner in fee simple of Lot No.
512-A of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Cadastre, described in Psu-19306
and located at <span class="SpellE">Bu­hangin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City; that the numerous defendants named
therein, conspiring and helping one another, entered into and occupied
different portions thereof, some in 1945 and others in the years 1946, 1947 and
1948, and started planting rice, corn, etc. therein and building their houses
thereon; that having refused to vacate the portions respectively occupied by
them notwithstanding repeated demands to do so, the plaintiff filed the action
for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and for the recovery of damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer the defendants claimed lack of knowledge and
information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth or falsity of the facts
alleged in the complaint and further alleged that they were the owners of the
portions individually occupied by each of them; that no decree had ever been
issued by the General Land Registration Office in favor of the plain­tiff or
any of its predecessors in interest; that the plain­tiff had lost its ownership
of the land in question by pres­cription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By way of counterclaim they further averred that the unwarranted filing
of the complaint had caused them damages in the total amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
rendered judgment as follows:</p>

finding that a decision was promulgated on <st1:date year="1930" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1930</st1:date> adjudicating in favor of Maria F.

enter into said premises on the understanding that they would vacate it as soon
as they could locate another place; (4) in not<span style="">&nbsp;

decision was affirmed in <span class="SpellE">toto</span> by the Court of

decision of the latter:</p>

<blockquote>"The record shows that Lot No. 512 of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Cadastre, Cadastral Case No. 1, GLRO Record No. 317, of the Court of First

nobody was residing in Lot No. 512-A, and it was in 1947 when some old tenants
and others who came from the <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> entered into Lot
No. 512-A, with the promise on the part of some of them that they were to
abandon the land as soon as they could find a place where they could re­side.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, Kong <span class="SpellE">Chai</span> Pin, the
widow of <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> Tan Sin <span class="GramE">An</span>,

of the intestate estate of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, the creditors, <span class="SpellE">Yutivo</span> &amp;
Sons Hardware Company and Sing, Yee and Chuan, Inc. filed their respective
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On approval of these claims, the
<span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> was ordered to pay the same out of the
funds of the administration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, she sold on April 7, 1949, in favor of Betty Y. Lee and
Washington Z. <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> the properties of Tan Sin An and
that of the commercial partnership of Tan Sin An and An­tonio C. <span class="SpellE">Goquialay</span> including Lot No. 512-A, which sale was approved
by the court and the same was registered in the office of the Re­gister of

<blockquote>“The appellants, however, assail the trial court in admitting
certain Exhibits, particularly Exhibits D, D-1, O, Q and O-1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argue that it has not been shown that
the District Land Officer of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, who issued a
certified copy of the alleged decision of the Supreme Court (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">D &amp; D-1), as the custodian of
the ori­ginal document or authentic copy from which Exhibit D was copied.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, Exhibit D is immaterial in that it
treats of a parcel of land which has an area of 331,941,060 square meters,
while the land in question has only an area of more than 88 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that it is not only illogical but also
preposterous to hold that Exhibit D has reference to the land under
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same arguments
according to the <span class="GramE">appellants,</span> hold true with respect to
Exhibit D-1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention that the District Land Officer, who certified
Exhibit D, does not appear to be the proper custodian of the ori­ginal or the
authentic copy from which said Exhibit D had been copied does not merit serious
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To start with, the appeal
wherein the decision (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. D) was ren­dered is
entitled 'El Director de <span class="SpellE">Terenos</span>, <span class="SpellE">peticionario</span>,
contra <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarca</span> et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., <span class="SpellE">oppositores</span>, Maria F.

El Director de Montes, <span class="SpellE">o­positor</span>, <span class="SpellE">apelado</span>;
and that an appeal was interposed by claimant Maria Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span>
against the partial decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in Cadastral Case No. 1, GLRO Rec. No. 317,
adjudicating Lot No. 512, with the exception of a portion containing 46
hectares and 7 <span class="SpellE">ares</span>, located on the Southeastern part
of said lot, the same having been declared forest land under the control and
administration of the Philip­pine Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the Director of Lands was a party to that case, it was but normal
that he should have been furnished with a copy of said decision, and inasmuch
as the District Land officer of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> was the
representative of the Director of Lands in that province, where Lot No. 512 is
situated, there is nothing unusual that a copy of said decision for the
Director of Lands was trans­mitted to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And checking <span class="SpellE">Expediente</span> Ca­dastral No. 1, GLRO
<span class="SpellE">Rec</span>, No. 317 with Exhibit D-2, which is a copy of the
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
dated <st1:date year="1930" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1930</st1:date>, we
entertain no doubt that Lot No. 512 was the same and one lot claimed by Maria
Villa-<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not of course in this connection lose sight of the statement on
page 1 of the decision of the Supreme Court dated <st1:date year="1931" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1931</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) <span class="GramE">that</span> Lot No. 512 contains 331,941,060 square meters, the
reason why appellants contend that said decision has no reference to Lot No.
512.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most such statement is a
typographical error, for reducing 331,941,060 square meters into hectares we
will have more than 33,194 while Lot No. 512 has only a total area of 1,358,067
square meters or 135 hectares and 8,067 square meters or a little less than 136
hectares (Pls. see <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">D-3 &amp;

obvious efforts to make us doubt that Lot No. 512-A had been adjudicated by the

Registration Commission, certifies in effect that the former order was complied
with.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, it must now deemed settled that the land
in question (Lot No. 512-A known also ac Lot No. 1926) was brought under the
operation of our land registration laws; that it was finally decreed and
registered originally in the name of Maria Villa-­<span class="SpellE">Abrille</span>;
that the latter mortgaged it, together with other properties, to La Urbana
etc., who subsequently foreclosed the mortgage and acquired all the mortgaged
properties at the foreclosure sale; that in 1938 La Ur­bana sold the properties
it had thus acquired to the partnership of Pedro Tan <span class="SpellE">Peh</span>
and Tan Sin An who, in turn, conveyed the same properties to the partnership of
Tan Sin An and Antonio G. <span class="SpellE">Goquialay</span> in 1940; that
subsequently, the properties became involved in, and formed part of the
Intestate Estate of Tan Sin An until April 7, 1949 when the <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>
thereof, with proper court authority and in order to pay duly approved claims
against the Estate, sold said properties (including Lot No. 512-A) to Betty Y.
Lee and Washington Z. <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, which sale was approved
by the probate court and was subsequently re­gistered in the Office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City; that in the year
1949 when the Insular Development Company was organized, the <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> spouses, two of the in­corporators, conveyed all said
properties to the corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the risk of stating what is obvious, We say that land
registration proceedings under Act 496 are <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>
end that such proceedings, as well as the title issued as a result thereof, are
binding and conclusive upon the whole world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the expiration of one year within which a petition to review the
decree of registration may be filed, said decree and the title issued pursuant
thereto become incontrovertible (Section 38, Act 496), and the same may no
longer be changed, altered or modified, much less set aside (Director of Lands
vs. Gutierrez David, 50 Phil. 797).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
has to be the rule, for if even after the ownership of a property has been
decreed by a land registration court in favor of a particular person the title
issued may still be annulled, changed, altered or modified after the lapse of
the one year period fixed by the legal provision mentioned above, the object of
the Torrens system, namely, to guarantee the indefeasi­bility of the title to
the property, would be defeated (<span class="SpellE">Cabaños</span> vs. Register
of Deeds 40, Phil. 620).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant
case the above doctrine should apply with more reason, considering the fact
that the property has passed from the hands of the original registered owner
into those of clearly innocent third parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' claim that the registration proceedings were
irregular and that the resulting decree and certi­ficate of title are void is
untenable, not only because of the rule of indefeasibility, but also because
the record of the present case discloses more than sufficient facts to support
the contrary, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there was a
decision rendered in the original proceedings; the same became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and the corresponding decree of re­gistration
and certificate of title were subsequently issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, all presumptions are in favor of
the regularity of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the conclusion set forth above, it seems hardly
necessary to say that, upon the facts alleged in appellants' amended petition
(complaint), they have no cause of action against the Insular Development
Corporation, and that the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for therein,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the set­ting aside and
cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. TT-9810; (b) a declaration of
ownership in their favor based on acquisitive prescription or, in the
alternative, (c) a declaration that the property in question is public land and
that, as occupants, they are entitled to priority rights in the acquisition of
the portions respectively occupied by each of them, can not be granted being in
derogation of the indefeasible title of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Insular Development Company, Inc.</p>
