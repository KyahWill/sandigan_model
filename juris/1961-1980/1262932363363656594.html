				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FORTUNATO MENDOZA, ET AL., DEFENDANTS, LORENZO VILLANUEVA AND COPIA MANSAKA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><p>On March 7, 1958, Fortunato Mendoza, Manuel de la Cruz, Lorenzo Villanueva, 
Copia Mansaka, Villamor Cor-puz, Ladjahali Patdi alias Kulot and Domingo Diaz 
alias Antonio Dominguez alias Bigote, were charged with murder before the Court 
of First Instance of Rizal. Upon arraignment, they all pleaded not guilty to the 
charge. Pending trial, the case against Ladjahali Patdi and Domingo Diaz alias 
Antonio Dominguez alias Bigote, was provisionally dismissed upon motion of the 
prosecuting fiscal. On March 2, 1959, the case against Fortunato Mendoza, Manuel 
de la Cruz and Villamor Corpuz was likewise provisionally dismissed upon motion 
of the prosecuting fiscal, leaving the accused Florencio Villanueva and Copia 
Mansaka to stand trial.</p>
<p>This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
convicting them, Lorenzo Villanueva and Copia Mansaka, of the crime of murder 
and sentencing them therefor to suffer the death penalty and to indemnify the 
heirs of the deceased jointly and severally in the sum of P6,00O and to pay the 
costs.</p>
<p>In the morning of March 6, 1958, between ten and eleven o'clock, appellants 
Villanueva and Mansaka surrendered themselves to the Keeper of Brigade No. 3B, 
Cell No. 5, of the National Penitentiary in Muntinglupa, Rizal, one Arsenio 
Pallera. They told the latter that they had just killed a fellow inmate and 
would wish to be brought to the Prison Inspector. At the same time, they turned 
over to Pallera an improvised bladed knife and an ice pick.</p>
<p>After conducting and leaving the surrenderees to Prison Inspector Melito 
Geronimo, Pallera left to notify the medical officer of the killing. The said 
officer, together with a nurse, then took the victim to the hospital where 
autopsy was performed. The report on the autopsy described "the cause of death 
as shock due to multiple wounds and that the most fatal of the fifteen wounds 
were those on the right and left chest as well as in the abdomen."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Inspector Geronimo investigated the appellants. In the said 
inquiry, both appellants admitted having killed Epifanio Paison. Their 
respective written statements, marked by the prosecution as Exhibits E and F, 
are hereumler quoted so far as relevant to this decision. The first, Exhibit E, 
is Lorenzo Villanueva's:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kahapon po nang hapon pagkatapos namin kutnain ng hapunan ay napagkaisahan 
namin ni COPIA MANSAKA na am ing patayirt si EPIFANIO PAISON. Halos hindi kami 
nakatulog magdamag at nang dumating ang umaga ay binuksan ng aming Keeper ang 
pintuan ay lumabas kami ni COPIA MANSAKA at naglinis ng fire escape. Pagkatapos 
kami makapaglinis ng fire escape ay dumating si Mr. Pallera at aming sinabi na 
buksan ang Drigada 3B at kami ay papasok na at kami ay binuksan naman. Kami noon 
ay may dala na na matalas at noon kami ay nasa loob na ng bri-gada 3-B ay umupo 
nalamang kami sa isang tabi. Noon inaakala ko na malapit na ang pagdating ng 
aming pagkain ay sinabi ko kay COPIA MANSAKA na pumunta na siya sa buyon at 
kaunin na niya si EPIFANIO PAISON. Finagbilinan ko si MANSAKA na kahit sino ang 
lalapit sa buyon ay huag papasukin at pinunta-han ko na si PAISON. Nadatnan ko 
Bi Paison na nakaupo doon sa isang tabi ng brigada at sinabi ko sa kanya na 
"sandali lamang at mayroon akong sasabihin sa iyo" at si Paison ay sumama na rin 
sa akin sa buyon. Pagdating ko sa loob ay sinabi ko na maliligo ako at siya ay 
huwag umalis. Pagkatapos ay mayroon akong tinuro na isang bagay kay Paison at 
noong siya ay tumingin ay sinabayan ko na nang saksak sa dibdib hanggang sa 
mamatay. Pagkatapos kong masaksak si Paison ay sinabayan din ng saksak ni Copia 
Mansaka. Nong nakabulagta na sa cemento si EPIFANIO PAISON ay pinutol ko ang 
kanyang kanang tainga at ifci-napon ko sa labas nang bintana."</p></blockquote>
<p>Copia Mansaka's statement, on the other hand, marked as Exhibit F by the 
prosecution, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kaninang tangbali humigit kumulang sa alas doce, fetsa 6 ng Marzo 1958, 
pagkatapos dalliin sa aming brigada ang aming pagkain ay pinagkaisahan namin ni 
LORENZO VILLANUEVA na lumabas sa aming brigada at lumipat sa Brigada 3-B at 
patayin namin si EPIFANIO PAISON. Pagkabukas ng pintuan ng brigada 3-B, ay ang 
ginawa namin ni LORENZO VILLANUEVA ay humawak kaming dalawa sa drum na mayroong 
laman na pagkain at nagkunwari kaming ranchero hanggang sa kami ay maka-Hpat sa 
3-B. Noong kami ay makapasok sa pintuan ng 3-B ay tinulak namin ang drum 
tuloy-tuloy sa loob at pagkatapos ay hinanap namin si EPIFANIO PAISON. Nakita 
namin si PAISON na nakaupo at pagkatapos ay dinala namin sa loob ng buyon 
(toilet) at pinagtulong-tulongau naming saksakin hanggang sa mamatay. Pagkatapos 
naming pataytn si EPIFANIO PAISON ay sumurender kami kay Mr. ARSENIO PALLERA na 
aming keeper at ibinigay namin ang matalas na aming ginamit sa 
pagpatay."</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from expressly acknowledging the commission of the crime, the herein 
defendants gave witness to their motives for stabbing the deceased, as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kaya ko siya pinatay ay noong magkaroon ng gulo sa aming brigada dahil noong 
fetsa 16 ng Febrero 19-r&gt;8 ay stnabi ko na kay Paison na umalis na siya at 
ang sagot sa akin, ay huag ko raw intindihin ang kanyang saiili at pakialaman ko 
ang sarili ko dahil sa kami ay magkalaban. Pagkatapos kung makapugsabi ay 
init-sahan ako nang bote sa tabla nang tarima at tinamaan ako sa aking paa. Kaya 
niagmula noon ay kami ay dinala sa plaza at binilad pagkatajms ay dinala sa 
Brigada 1-A at doon ay pinanga-ralan ko siya at sinabi ko sa kanya na 
pinalatawad ko siya ngunit ang sabi sa akin ay huag ko siya na intindihtn at 
intindihin ko ang sarili ko, kaya inula noon ay pinagbanlaun ko na Biya na 
pataytn," (Exhibit K.)</p>
<p>"Ang dahilah po ay dahit sa hinngisan ni Paison ng matalas ang paa ni Lorenzo 
Villanueva at naaugatan kaya napagkaisahan namih ni Villauucva na patayin si 
Paison kahapon ngunit wala kaming pagkakataon at kanina lamang kami nagkaroon ng 
ma-buksan ang pintuan ng brigada 3-B at 3-A noong magdala ng pagkain." (Exhibit 
F.)</p></blockquote>
<p>During the trial, the prosecution also presented an eyewitness to the crime. 
Kicardo Corpuz, who was the Assistant Mayor of the brigade where the victim was 
confined, testified that in the morning of the incident, he was with Paison 
until someone came along and invited Paison to go with him. Soon thereafter, he 
saw Paison being dragged towards the toilet where other men were waiting. Upon 
reaching the toilet, he saw the appellants stab the victim. Finally, Corpuz 
testified that "Paison was able to run away shouting that he was being stabbed; 
that the accused ran after him nnd upon catching him took turns in stabbing him 
until he fell dead."</p>
<p>After trial, the lower court found "that the two accused killed Paison and 
that it is not true that they killed in self-defense." Accordingly, it imposed 
the penalty under appeal.</p>
<p>Both Villanueva and Mausakn, at the trial as well as in this appeal, admit 
having stabbed to death Epifanio Paison. In justification, however, they plead 
self defense. They claimed that in the morning of the incident, the victim, 
unprovoked and with evident intent to kill, attacked Villanueva with a knife and 
that the latter was only able to wrest the weapon from Paison and used it on him 
instead. And, when Mansaka intervened to pacify and break up the two, the victim 
likewise turned on Mansaka with an ice pick. As with Villanueva, Mansaka says he 
merely wrested the ice pick from Paison and used it on the victim. And 
consistently with their plea of self defense, appellants repudiated at the trial 
the statements they gave to Inspector Geronimo. They told the trial court that 
they affixed their signature and thumbmark, respectively, on Exhibits E and F 
without knowing their contents as the said exhibits were not read to them. </p>
<p>After carefully and thoroughly going through the records, We are convinced 
beyond doubt that the guilt of the appellants for the crime of murder has been 
fully established at the trial. We find no alternative, therefore, but to affirm 
the judgment under appeal.</p>
<p>In the first place, We cannot now ignore the contents of Exhibits E and F 
where the appellants expressly acknowledged the commission of the crime charged. 
The evidence is overwhelming that the said documents were executed voluntarily 
by them. Other than the self serving insistence that the same were not read,to 
them, appellants have not charged any irregularity in the execution of Exhibits 
E and F. They do not deny that they voluntarily submitted themselves to 
Inspector Geronimo and gave statements to him relative to the killing. They do 
not deny that after their statements were taken, Inspector Geronimo took them to 
the Assistant Director of Prisons who administered the oath on them; nor that 
their confessions were duly witnessed by two prison authorities, Inspector 
Fernandez and Holipeiia. At no stage in the proceedings below have the herein 
defendants accused any prison personnel of torturing or maltreating them to 
secure their extrajudicial confessions. They have not adverted to any possible 
reason why Inspector Geronimo should falsify or alter their narration. But most 
convincing of all, the said exhibits contain details in the commission of the 
crime which none but the participants to the offense could have provided.</p>
<p>Secondly, We reject appellant's claim to self defense upon the fundamental 
consideration that the said justifying circumstance may be accepted only when it 
is established at the trial that the accused did not initiate the unlawful 
aggression. In other words, where the victim has not been shown to have 
commenced the criminal attack, self defense cannot arise as a justification for 
the injury or death that the defendants stand indicted for. It is a 
presupposition of that defense that a material attack has been taken by the 
victim (People vs. Santos, 17 Phil. 887; People vs. Banzuelo, 31 Phil. 365; 
People vs. Apolinario, 58 Phil. 586).</p>
<p>In the case under review, not only have the appellants failed to demonstrate 
the victim's criminal aggression; on the contrary, the evidence is conclusive 
that they were the ones guilty of aggression.</p>
<p>Neither appellants were supposed to be in the brigade where the victim was 
incarcerated. They were both inmates of Brigade No. 3A and they have not pointed 
to any authorization that could have justified their presence at Brigade No. 3B. 
By their own confession, it was by trickery that they gained entry into the 
latter brigade. They held on to a prison meal cart, pushed it towards Brigade 
3B, and pretended to be "rancheros", that is, prisoners in charge of bringing 
food to the cells. These are indubitable indications of their premeditated 
determination to carry out the assassination of Paison. These are, 
unquestionably, acts of aggression.</p>
<p>Furthermore, appellants' claim that they were together when they went inside 
Brigade No. 3B furnishes another proof that the victim could not have been the 
aggressor. It is unnatural to suppose that he had deliberately abandoned all 
caution and submitted himself to the reckless folly of attacking two men all by 
himself.</p>
<p>Aside from the foregoing", another settled rule prevents us from sustaining 
appellants' theory. The justifying circumstance of self defense, once the act 
against which it is invoked is admitted or proved, should be established by 
positive evidence. It is an affirmative allegation which must be demonstrated 
with convincing credibility (People vs. Bauden, 77 Phil. 105; People vs. 
Apolinario, 58 Phil. 586; People vs. Gimena, 59 Phil. 509). The case for the 
defendants falls far short of the standard.</p>
<p>The account given by the defendants of the alleged attack upon their persons 
is simply incredible. According to them, while they were in Brigade No. 3B, on 
their way to clean a fire escape, Epifanio Paison, suddenly and unprovoked, 
attacked Villanueva with a knife. A fight ensued and Villanueva was slightly 
wounded in both arms. After a brief scuffle, Villanueva was able to wrest the 
weapon away from Paison and with it, he stabbed the latter in the chest.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Copia Mansaka testified that after Villanueva had stabbed 
Paison, he stepped in to break up the fight and separate the combatants. He was 
able to part Villanueva who thereupon turned away to look for cloth with which 
to bandage his, Villanueva's wounded arms. However, Paison refused to be 
pacified and instead drew an ice pick from his pocket and tried to stab him. 
Mansaka claimed that like Villanueva, he was able to take the ice pick away, and 
with it, stab the deceased.</p>
<p>By appellant's recitation of the incident, therefore, they took on Paison one 
at a time. This is difficult to believe. It is not natural Hint two friends or 
companions, attacked by a common enemy, should meet the assault one at a time. 
The more credible response to such an emergency was for them to have repelled 
together the deadly threat. The more reasonable and instinctive reaction then 
was for them to have joined their eflForts and resources to protect 
themselves.</p>
<p>Besides, We find it similarly incredible that ViHanueva, after being 
separated by his co-accused from Paison, should simply walk away and search for 
bandaging material for the superficial wounds in his arms. We cannot accept that 
as the rational reaction of one whose life was so dangerously challenged by an 
unprovoked adversary. It would seem that having recovered from a serious attempt 
on his life, and, having taken the upper hand from his attacker, ViHanueva would 
have adopted a less timid attitude.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of wounds on the body of the deceased, and their location 
as registered in the autopsy report, expose the inherent weakness of the claim 
to self defense. There were in all fifteen wounds, one in the neck, two in the 
abdomen, seven in the chest and the others in the various parts of the arms. In 
addition, the right ear of the victim was cut ofT. In contrast, ViHanueva had 
but a couple of superficial, suspicious cuts in his arms while Mansaka was 
completely unscratched. If all these suggest anything, it is that the victim had 
been sot upon by determined assailants and definitely not that he has lost a 
fight he himself started.</p>
<p>Considering al! the foregoing, then, it is clear that the crime committed was 
murder qualified by evident premeditation. Insofar as Lorenzo Villanueva's 
participation in the killing is concerned, the following aggravating 
circumstances were established beyond doubt at the trial: (1) reiteration or 
habituality, since he was previously convicted for two crimes and for which he 
was in confinement, namely: robbery and evasion of sentence (Art. 14, par. 10, 
Revised Penal Code); (2) ignominy or cruelty as he confessed to cutting ofF the 
ear of the deceased (Art. 11, par. 21, Revised Penal Code) ; (3) craft, in 
pretending to be "rancheros" to gain entry into Brigade 3B (Art. 14, par. 14, 
Revised Penal Code); and (4) that the crime was committed in contempt of or 
"with insult to public authorities (Art. 14, par. 2, Revised Penal Code). With 
respect to Copia Mansaka, the following1 aggravating circumstances have been 
conclusively proven at the trial: (1) Recidivism, having been previously 
convicted of murder and evasion of service of sentence (Art. 14, par. 9, Revised 
Penal Code); (2) Craft, as above; and (3) that the crime was committed in 
contempt of or with insult to public authorities, same as above.</p>
<p>The only mitigating circumstance appreciable in their favor is voluntary 
surrender. Consequently, as there are more aggravating than mitigating 
circumstances, and in accordance with paragraphs three and four of Article 64 of 
the Revised Penal Code, the maximum penalty provided by the code should be 
imposed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the lower court imposing the death penalty and 
requiring the accused to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of 
P6,000 is hereby affirmed. Costs de oficio.</p>
