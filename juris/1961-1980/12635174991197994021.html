of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed this special proceeding for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and <i style="">mandamus</i> against respondent Judge
<span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
complaining of the snail's pace at which its action for denaturalization of the
other respondent Chua Tee was being acted upon, eleven of his motions for
postponement being granted by the court although no opposition to the move to
denaturalize was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was more
than just a hint in the petition before us of respondent Judge's evident bias
in favor of the other respondent, the most conspicuous instance of which was
his being allowed to take the oath of citizenship without hearing any objection
that the then Solicitor General could have interposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an admission in the main of the
crucial facts alleged although coupled with an attempt, none-too-successful, to
divest them of their decisive significance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, we find for <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was stated in the petition filed with this Court on July 7,
1967 that respondent's naturalization application<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
before the Court of First Instance of Manila was marred by such defects as
failure to state all the former places of residence of the petitioner, absence
of any allegation as to compliance with the educational requirement by
enrollment in local schools of applicant's children although they were past
school age, lack of showing as to whether petitioner filed a declaration of
intention, and if not, the reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was a certificate of arrival attached to
the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise defective
on the score of insufficient data as to the date and place of birth of his wife
or her present residence as well as that of the children born out of such
union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, so it was averred in
this <i style="">certiorari</i> proceeding before us,
on <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1960</st1:date>, the lower
court rendered a decision granting the petition finding that now respondent
Chua Tee was possessed of all the qualifications required by law and none of
the disqualifications and ordered that a proper naturalization certificate be
issued to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1962</st1:date>,
respondent Chua Tee filed with the lower court a petition to take his oath of
allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notification to the
Office of the Solicitor General on the same date, July 31, 1962, was
insufficient to justify a hearing preparatory to oath-taking to be conducted on
the date set in said notice, limited as it was to asking the lower court for a
date for the reception of evidence on oath-taking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1962</st1:date>, after the aforesaid motion was heard and granted,
the respondent Judge received with undue haste respondent Chua Tee's evidence
in the absence of the Solicitor General or his authorized representative, and
thereafter allowed respondent Chua Tee to take the oath of allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="8">August
 10, 1962</st1:date>, the Republic filed with the respondent Judge an urgent
motion for reconsideration praying the lower court to reopen the case to enable
the Solicitor General to cross-examine the respondent Chua Tee and to present
evidence for the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same
date, <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1962</st1:date>,
respondent Chua Tee filed with respondent Judge an opposition to said
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 11, 1962, the
respondent Judge denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration and allowed
the petitioner to take his oath with the condition that if within 30 days the
Office of the Solicitor General should receive any evidence against the
applicant, now respondent Chua Tee, from the National Bureau of Investigation,
the court would reconsider and give the Solicitor General an opportunity to cross-examine
him based on said report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that very
day, <span style="">respondent Chua Tee, not losing
any time, subscribed to an oath of allegiance before respondent Judge, who, two
days thereafter, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="9"><span style="">September 13, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, directed the clerk of </span>court to issue
a certificate of naturalization to respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioners filed a motion for cancellation of certificate of naturalization
based on the ground that the same was fraudulently and illegally obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for cancellation was initially set
for hearing on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1966</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> a. m. but it was postponed <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> by
respondent Judge to <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1966</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> a. m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although no opposition to said motion has
been filed, respondent Chua Tee filed eleven successive motions for
postponement, all of which were granted by respondent Judge, the last, to <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1967</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> a. m. This course of conduct of respondent Judge was
characterized as "dragging his feet", the postponements being allowed
for the flimsiest of reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> being convinced that there
was no end in sight to such dilatory moves sanctioned by the respondent Judge
and there being no appeal nor any plain, speedy and any other adequate remedy
in the ordinary course of law, this action for <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i>
was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prayer was for a writ of preliminary injunction restraining
respondent Chua Tee from representing himself to be a Filipino citizen or
exercising any of the rights and privileges of such citizenship, and requiring
him to surrender the original Certificate of Naturalization No. 3226 to the
clerk of this Court as well as for a judgment declaring null and void the
entire proceedings before respondent Judge, ordering him at the same time to
dismiss the original petition for naturalization and to cancel the aforesaid
certificate of citizenship issued to respondent Chua Tee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was filed by the then Solicitor
General, now a member of this Court, the Honorable Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 18, 1967, this Court adopted a resolution giving due course
to the above petition ordering respondents to file their answer and issuing a
writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to respondent Chua Tee to surrender to
the clerk of this Court the original Certificate of Naturalization No. 3226
issued to him by the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila as well as
a writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction restraining him from representing
himself to be a Filipino citizen or exercising any of the rights and privileges
of such citizenship until further orders of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer of August 14, 1967, there was a denial by
respondent Chua Tee that his application for naturalization was patently
defective or that there was a failure of the lower court to acquire
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise asserted that
there was no insufficiency in law in his motion for a hearing preparatory to
his oath-taking, <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>
having received the notice of hearing on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1962</st1:date> in advance of the date of the actual
presentation of evidence on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="8">August 4,
 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of
postponements, he admitted that his motions to that effect were granted by
respondent Judge, but alleged in justification that the then Solicitor General
did not oppose such motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a
denial that respondent Judge was dragging his feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stress was laid, in the affirmative and
special defenses, on the failure of petitioner to appeal the decision of <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1960</st1:date> granting the petition
for naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was respondent
Chua Tee’s contention, therefore, that two years having elapsed and the
Solicitor General having been notified of the hearing for his petition for
oath-taking with the result that he was allowed to do so without the necessary
appeal again having been interposed, his right to such status was then beyond
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed for the lifting of
the preliminary injunction and the dismissal of this special civil action for <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Crucial to the solution
of the controversy before us was the failure of the government to be
represented at the hearing on the evidence required to be received by the lower
court after the two-year period from the promulgation of the decision granting
the application as </span>required by <span style="">Republic
Act No. 530.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Why the Solicitor General was unable to </span>do
<span style="">so was explained by him in the petition
before us.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It turned out that while his office did
receive, on July 31, 1962, a copy of the motion to take the oath filed by
respondent Chua Tee, the hearing thereon, not the introduction of evidence,
being set for August 4, 1962, it was not until August 6 of that year that he
received the same, unfortunately not accompanied by the records of the petition
which could not be found in the office files despite diligent search.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the Solicitors then went to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent Judge to check the records, and he found
out that on August 4, 1962, the date when such motion to take the oath was
heard, respondent Chua Tee was permitted to present his evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, and on the very same day respondent Judge
issued an order allowing him to take the oath of allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="8"><span style="">August 10, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, an urgent motion for reconsideration
specifically calling the attention of respondent Judge to the indispensability
of the attendance of the Solicitor General or his representative as required by
the express language of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
then Solicitor General sought the setting aside of the order of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="8"><span style="">August 4,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> so that the
case could be reopened and the opportunity to cross-examine respondent Chua Tee
be afforded him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge, in
his order of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="8"><span style="">August 11, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, was deaf to such a plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He refused to reconsider his order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The failure of respondent
Judge to reconsider such order to enable the Solicitor General or his
representative to present the evidence against the proposed oath-taking,
considering that there was a justification for his non-appearance on August 4,
1962 and that, furthermore, what was supposed to have been taken up on that day
before respondent Judge was merely the hearing as to when the evidence would be
received, infected all subsequent proceedings with a fatal infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compliance with the literal language of the
law requires that such order allowing the oath taking be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The doctrines previously
announced by us leave no other conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Go <span class="SpellE">Im</span> <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> v.
Republic,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> there is a recognition by us of the broad
sweep implicit in the language of Republic Act No. 530.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, who spoke for the Court: "While it is true
that no appeal was taken from the decision of the lower court granting
Philippine citizenship to the original petitioner, Lim <span class="SpellE">Quico</span>,
the fact that said decision had not yet become final in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1 of Republic Act 530 and the case came up to this Court
on appeal by the Government in connection with the proceedings required under
said Section 1 of Republic Act 530, this case is open for review in its
entirety by this Court regardless of whether or not objection had been made in
connection with a particular point during the proceedings in the court below."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That has been the
prevailing view since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only on June
30 of this year, in Republic v. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we had occasion to state: "There should
be no retract, to quote from Republic v. Santos, from 'the firm and unwavering
adherence, so manifest in the decisions of this Court, to the concept that
Filipino citizenship being an inestimable boon and a priceless acquisition, one
who seeks to enjoy its rights and privileges must not shirk the most exacting
scrutiny as to his fulfilling the qualifications required by law, which must be
fully met and could be inquired into at any stage of the proceeding, whether it
be in the course of the original petition or during the stage leading to his
oath-taking pursuant to Republic Act No. 530.' * * *.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The order granting the
oath-taking being thus void on its face, the steps subsequently taken were
likewise equally bereft of any legal force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the view we take of the case then,
there is no need to pass upon the question of whether or not respondent Judge was
guilty of a grave abuse of discretion in allowing the dilatory action taken in
connection with petitioner’s motion for denaturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there was in legal contemplation no
naturalization </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">yet of respondent Chua Tee, it would be
premature, at this stage, to go into any further discussion of such aspect of
this litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of <i style="">certiorari</i>
prayed for is granted, and the judge assigned to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
of respondent Judge directed to set anew the hearing of the evidence under
Republic Act No. 530 to enable respondent Chua Tee to prove his right to a
certificate of naturalization, at which hearing the presence of the Solicitor
General or his representative is indispensable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our writ of preliminary mandatory injunction requiring respondent Chua
Tee to surrender to the Clerk of this Court the original certificate of
naturalization No. 3226 issued to him by the Clerk of the Court of First
Instance of Manila is hereby made permanent, and such certificate of
naturalization No. 3226 declared cancelled, void and of no effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meanwhile, respondent Chua Tee
continues to be enjoined from representing himself to be a Filipino citizen or <span class="SpellE">excercising</span> any of the rights <span style="">and </span>privileges of such citizenship until the matter in issue has
been finally decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
