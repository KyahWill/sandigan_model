				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Cebu denying the 
petition filed by the Government, through the Solicitor General, for the 
cancellation of the certificate of naturalization issued to Go Bon 
Lee—hereinafter referred to as Go.
<p>Go was granted Philippine citizenship by the Court of First Instance of Cebu 
on November 26, 1941 and on February 11, 1942 he took his oath of allegiance, 
and naturalization certificate No. 4 was issued to him thereafter.</p>
<p>On August 15, 1951 the Solicitor General filed a petition for the 
cancellation of Go's certificate of naturalization on the following grounds: (1) 
that the same was obtained illegally or contrary to law because Go did not then 
have all the necessary qualifications to become a citizen of the Philippines; 
(2) that at the time he was granted Philippine citizenship, he had not enrolled 
all his minor children of school age in any public or private school recognized 
by the Office of Private Education where Philippine history, government and 
civics are taught or prescribed as part of the school curriculum; (3) that he 
did not reside continuously in the Philippines for ten years; (4) and finally, 
that he filed his petition for naturalization on April 18, 1941 in violation of 
Section 5 of the Revised Naturalization Law, because at that time one year had 
not yet elapsed since he filed with the Bureau of Justice a sworn declaration of 
his intention to become a citizen of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is not denied that Go, bound as he was by the law requiring the filing of 
a declaration of intention to become a citizen of the Philippines, complied with 
said requirement on May 23, 1940 (Exh. C). Neither is it disputed that his 
petition for naturalization was filed with the Court of First Instance of Cebu 
on April 18, 1941 (Exh. C)—clearly in violation of the provision of Section 5 of 
the Revised Naturalization Law to the effect that the petition for 
naturalization must be filed after one year from the filing of the aforesaid 
declaration of intention.</p>
<p>The lower court, however, held the view that Go had substantially complied 
with this requirement because, after all, the hearing of his petition was held 
more than one year after the filing of his declaration of intention to become a 
citizen. We disagree with this view. The language of the law on the matter being 
express and explicit, it is beyond the province of the courts to take into 
account questions of expediency, good faith and other similar reasons in the 
construction of its provisions (De los Santos <em>vs</em>. Mallare, 87 Phil, 
289; 48 Off. Gaz., 1787). Were we to j accept the view of the lower court on 
this matter, there would be no good reason why a petition for naturalization , 
cannot be filed one week after or simultaneously with the filing of the required 
declaration of intention as long as the hearing is delayed to a date after t. e 
expiration 01 the period of one year. The ruling of the lower court amounts, in 
our opinion, to a substantial change in the law, something which courts can not 
do, their duty being to apply the law and not tamper with it (Uy Chin Hua 
<em>vs</em>. Dinglasan, 86 Phil., 617; 47 Off. Gaz. 12 Supp. p. 233; Orestoff 
<em>vs</em>. Government etc., 71 Phil., 240). In U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ginsberg, 
243 U. S. 472, 475; 61 L. Ed. 853, 856, cited in Bautista <em>vs</em>. Republic, 
etc., 87 Phil., 818; it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An alien who seeks political rights as a member of this nation can rightly 
obtain them only upon terms and conditions specified by Congress. Courts are 
without authority to sanction changes or modifications; their duty is rigidly to 
enforce the legislative will in respect of the matter so vital to the public, 
welfare."</p></blockquote>
<p>In connection with the question of appellee's failure to enroll all his minor 
children of school age in a public or private school recognized by the Office of 
Private Education of the Philippines, etc.—which is mandatory, failure to comply 
with it constituting a valid ground for the denial of the petition for 
citizenship (Tan <em>vs</em>. Republic, etc. 92 Phil., 915; 49 Off. Gaz., p. 
1409) or for the cancellation of a certificate of naturalization already 
issued—it appears that when Go filed his petition for naturalization in 1941 he 
had five minor children of school age, four of whom were then living in China, 
where they were born, and had never been enrolled in any recognized public or 
private schpol in the Philippines. It has been held in this connection that the 
fact that applicant's minor children were born and have lived since infancy in 
China does noV excuse him from complying with this particular requirement of the 
law (Lim <em>vs</em>. Republic etc., G. R. No. L-3575, Dec. 26, 1950; Hao Lian 
Chu <em>vs</em>. Republic etc., 87 Phil., 668; 48 Off. Gaz., p. 1780). Go's 
claim that his failure to comply with this legal requirement was due to 
different factors beyond his control, such as the unsettled conditions in China 
and the strictness of Philippine Immigration Laws, do not constitute valid 
excuses for non-compliance (Hao Lian Chu <em>vs</em>. Republic etc., 
<em>supra</em>). Moreover, according to appellee's own testimony, in 1930 he 
took his daughter Juanita—who was born in Cebu—to China where she remained until 
she was brought back to the Philippines in 1938. No satisfactory proof has been 
presented to show that Go had exerted efforts at that time to bring to the 
Philippines his other four minor children.</p>
<p>In denying the petition of the Government the lower court expressed the view 
that the matter of Go's citizenship was already <em>res judicata</em> and that 
the Government was in estoppel to question his status aa a citizen upon any 
ground which could have been raised before or during the hearing of the petition 
for naturalization. This we find to be untenable.</p>
<p>It is settled that the doctrine of estoppel or of laches does not apply 
against the Government suing in its capacity as Sovereign or asserting 
governmental rights. It has been held that the Government is never estopped by 
mistakes or errors on the part of its agents (Pineda <em>vs</em>. Court of First 
Instance of Tayabas, 52 Phil., 803, 807), and that estoppel eannot give validity 
to an act that is prohibited by law or is against public policy (Benguet 
Consolidated etc. <em>vs</em>. Pineda etc., 96 Phil., 711; 52 Off. Gaz., [4] 
1961; Eugenio <em>vs</em>. Perdido, 97 Phil., 41).</p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike final decisions in actions and other proceedings in 
court, a decision or order granting citizenship to the applicant does not really 
become executory, and a naturalization proceeding not being a judicial adversary 
proceeding, the decision rendered therein is not <em>res judicata</em> as to any 
of the reasons or matters which would support a judgment cancelling the 
certificate of naturalization for illegal or fraudulent procurement. As a matter 
of fact, it is settled in this jurisdiction that a certificate of naturalization 
may be cancelled upon grounds or conditions subsequent to the granting of the 
certificate of naturalization. Thus in Bell <em>vs</em>. Attorney General, 56 
Phil., 667, it was held that a certificate of naturalization may be cancelled if 
it is found subsequently that the applicant for citizenship secured the same by 
misleading the Courts on any material fact. Finally, the following was said in 
U. S. <em>vs</em>. Spohrer, 175 Fed. 440:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An alien friend is offered under certain conditions the privilege of 
citizenship. He may accept the offer and become a citizen upon compliance with 
the prescribed conditions, but not otherwise. His claim is of favor, not of 
right. He can only become a citizen upon and after a strict compliance with the 
acts of Congress. An applicant for this high privilege ia hound, therefore, to 
conform to the terms upon which alone the right he seeks can be conferred. It is 
his province, and he is bound, to see that the jurisdictional facts upon which 
the grant is predicated actually exist, and if they do not he takes nothing by 
this paper grant.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"Congress having limited, this privilege to a specified class of persons, no 
other person is entitled to such privilege, nor to a certificate purporting to 
grant it, and any such certificate issued to a person not so entitled to receive 
it must be treated as a mere nullity, which confers no legal rights as against 
the government, from which it has been obtained without warrant of 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and 
another is rendered cancelling. Certificate of Naturalization No. 4 heretofore 
issued to appellee Go Bon Lee, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
