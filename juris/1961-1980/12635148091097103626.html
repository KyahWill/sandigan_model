				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A petition for writs of <i style="">certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i style="">mandamus</i>, with
preliminary injunction, to the Court of First Instance of Iloilo; on <i style="">certiorari</i>, to set aside the order,
dated July 22, 1964, directing the administrator of the estate of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Siason</span>, deceased, to sell at public auction a "two
storey building" included in the inventory of the property of the intestate
to pay the claims of creditors; on prohibition, to restrain the enforce­ment of
the aforesaid order; and, on <i style="">mandamus</i>,
to order the respondent Judge to approve and certify the record on appeal submitted
by the petitioner appealing from the aforesaid order of July 22, 1964.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition was given
due course, and the respondents were required to answer; however, the writs of
preliminary injunction was not granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent Judge, in
his own behalf, </span><span style="">filed </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">answer, </span><span style="">and the private
respondents also filed a separate answer in their own behalf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Culled from the
allegations </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the petition and the answer, and the annexes
thereto, the following facts are not debated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Siason</span> had lived to­gether as husband and wife without the
benefit of </span>marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">They had four children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Jaime <span class="SpellE">Siason</span>
died, he was survived by the petitioner and their four </span>children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The record does now show that the <span style="">deceased </span>was ever married to another
woman.) The property he had left was <span style="">a
</span>two storey building constructed on the <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Ester H. <span class="SpellE">Jamora</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the institution of the intestate
proceedings of the estate of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Abucion</span> was appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 21, 1964, the court approved the
accounting sub­mitted by the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, but at
the same time re­lived her of her position, and in her place, the court
appointed Atty. Julio <span class="SpellE">Albis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Floreña</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span> co­-administrators of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the only property left by
the deceased and which was under administration was the aforesaid two storey
building, and none other, the record fails to disclose the reason and necessity
for the appointment of two administrators of the estate, unless it could be for
<span style="">a </span>reason, <span style="">as </span>discussed hereinafter, that <span class="SpellE">Floreña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tina­gan</span> was claiming
proprietary rights and interests or one-half of the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that <span style="">as </span>it may, the <span style="">fact </span>is,
<span style="">however, that <span class="SpellE">Albis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span> both quali­fied for the position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stated in the order of
July 22, 1964, the approved claims </span>against the estate aggregates <span style="">to P5,000.00, which fact, however, </span>is <span style="">disputed by <span class="SpellE">Tina­gan</span>,
contending that the proceedings leading to their approval by the court were irregular
and contrary to law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The creditors of the
estate whose claims </span>al<span style="">legedly
had been approved by the court on July 9, 1964, filed a joint petition for the
payment of their claims, contending that as the estate had no funds with which
to pay their claims, it was necessary that the two storey buildings be sold at
public auction, and with the proceeds <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to
pay their claims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Floreña</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span> opposed
the petition, contend­ing that the alleged claims against the estate had not
been approved by the court, and, granting that there was an order of approval,
the proceedings lead­ing to such approval, was irregular, as there was no
notice to the interested parties; hence, the order is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further specifically alleged that
"the one-half (1/2) undivided share of the building of strong materials
consisting of two stories, belongs to her by reason of the fact that the said
building was constructed thru the joint efforts, savings and industry of the
herein <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> with the late Jaime <span class="SpellE">Siason</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After consideration by
the court of the joint petition of the creditors and the opposition thereto,
the court, on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, issued the disputed or­der.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is stated in the order that the
claims of the creditors against the estate had been approved by the court, that
the estate had no funds with which to pay the said claims, and that the only
income of the estate is that coming from the rental of the build­ing at the
rate of P175.00 a month which, on the other hand, is burdened with a charge for
the support of <span class="SpellE">Ti­nagan</span> and her minor children with
the deceased, however, the court failed to resolve the vital question posed by <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>, that one-half (1/2) of the building belongs to
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, in the answer of the
respondent Judge to the instant petition, the follow­ing is alleged:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That he Denies all the averments contained in Paragraph 27 of
the Petition, the truth being that if Petitioner had ever any valid claim on
the only property of the deceased Jaime <span class="SpellE">Siason</span>, Sr. <span style="">which was advertised for sale at </span>public
auction to raise money to pay the creditors of the estate, said petitioner
should have filed <span style="">a bond
"conditioned to pay the debts, expenses of administration, </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> within such time as the Court
directs; and such bond shall <span style="">be for the
security of the cre</span><span style="">ditors"
in accordance with Section 3, Rule 89 of the </span>Rules <span style="">of Court, or that she should have filed a
separate civil action in Court against Atty. Julio <span class="SpellE">Albis</span>,
an Administrator of the Estate, in accordance with Section 1 of Rule 87 of the
Rules of Court where the Court may </span>issue <span style="">an </span><span style="">order enjoining the
sale of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim of owner­ship
by the petitioner of one-half (1/2) of the house without any lien whatsoever -
free from taxes, free from </span>paying rentals to the owner of the land where
it stands, free from paying the owner of the materials used in the construction
<span style="">of the house, without defraying the
costs of </span>repair - cannot be validly heard and <span style="">decided by </span>the Court in an intestate proceeding but in a
separate civil action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>reconsideration
of the order filed by <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span> having been denied, she
perfected an appeal from the order and submitted in due time <span style="">a </span>record on
appeal and appeal bond of P120.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="7"><span style="">July 29,
 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the court
disapproved the re­cord on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
order reads </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering that this case is under the joint administra­tion
of Julio <span class="SpellE">Albis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Floreña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>, the record on appeal filed by counsel, Atty.
German M. Lopez, for <span class="SpellE">Floreña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>,
<span style="">is disapproved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">suggested </span>that the joint administrators should be consulted in
all proceedings affecting this case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the foregoing order would seem to suggest that the
record on appeal was disapproved be­cause the co-administrator Julio <span class="SpellE">Albis</span> has not given his conformity thereto, but not that
the record on appeal was either incomplete, defective or filed out of
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1964</st1:date>, denying the
reconsideration of the disallow­ance of the record on appeal, confirms the
foregoing pronouncement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order reads
as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">"O R D E R<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>This refers to the <span style="">motion </span>for
reconsideration filed by Atty. German Lopez, as counsel of <span class="SpellE">Floreñia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tinagan</span>, which the court only received on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="9">September <span style="">2, </span>1964</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Before this court ordered the sale <span style="">of </span>the property, Atty. Lopez was<span style=""> </span>asked by
the creditors and by the Court <span style="">as </span>to how he could pay the accounts of the
estate, which have been approved by the Court and his plan of meeting the
obligations of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Lopez
informed the court that the accounts shall be paid out of the income of the
estate. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It has been established that the
income of the estate is very much less than the monthly allowances given to the
minor children, for the rental of the lot, etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only property of the estate is the house which in due time may lose
its value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the
order of this court to sell the property for the best interest of the creditors
and the estate.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The court finds that all the actuations of Atty. Lopez have been
done without consulting the co-administrator of the estate who has an equal say
<span style="">as </span>regards
the administration of the estate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering that the creditors in this proceedings should first be
fully paid of their claims before anything can be distributed to the heirs, and
con­sidering further that the actuations of Atty. German Lopez is not sanction
by Atty. Julio <span class="SpellE">Albis</span>, a co-administra­tor of the
estate, the motion for reconsideration filed by Atty. German Lopez is denied.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on September 3, 1964, in compliance with the
orders of July 22, 1964 and August 8, 1964, the deputy clerk of court sold at
public auction the aforementioned two storey building for the sum of P7,500.00
(its appraised value was P10,450.00) to the Iloilo Chinese Commercial High
School, the highest bidder at the auction sale, and a certi­ficate of sale was
issued on the same date by the de­puty clerk of court <span style="">in </span>favor of the Iloilo Chinese Commercial High School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Vide, Exhibit V, p. 81, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts clearly demonstrate that the writs of <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition have to be
denied for the reason than the issue or issues posed upon the facts in relation

sale of the property in question had become a consummated transaction and
