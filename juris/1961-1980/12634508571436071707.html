				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">We are asked in this appeal to reverse the order of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City dis­missing for lack
of jurisdiction the petition for cer­tiorari in Special Civil Case No. 63 of
said court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">A protest was filed with the District Land Office of the Bureau
of Lands at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> by the <span class="SpellE">Zam­boanga</span>
General Utilities, Inc. against the Goodrich International Rubber Company,
Inc., for the forcible occupation over, and encroachment into, a portion of
public land which had already been applied for, occupied and improved by the
former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, at which both
parties were represented, the Director of Lands, on June 27, 1958, rendered a
decision awarding the whole of Lot No. 1, SWO-40126, and one hundred forty-four
(144) hectares of Lot No. 2, SW0-40126, the contested lot, to the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> General Utilities, Inc., and to the Goodrich
International Rubber Company, Inc., three hundred eighty (380) hectares of said
Lot 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feeling aggrieved, <span class="SpellE">Zam­boanga</span> Utilities appealed to the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources on the basic contention that it was entitled
to the whole area of Lot No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1959</st1:date>, the Secretary
rendered <span style="">a </span>decision
"concurring in the result" of the decision of the Director of Lands,
and denied the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motion for
reconsideration having been denied, the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
Utilities filed a petition for <span style="">a </span>writ
of certiorari with this Court on <st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="3">March
 22, 1960</st1:date>, but this was dismissed "without prejudice to filing
an action, if any, in the Court of First Instance."</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, on June 22, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
Utilities filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>
City a petition for "CERTIORARI" against <span class="GramE">the</span>
Secretary of Agri­culture and Natural Resources, the Director of Lands, and
Goodrich International Rubber Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1960</st1:date>,
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Director of Lands,
through their respective counsels filed separate answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="7">July
 29, 1960</st1:date>, the Goodrich also filed, through counsel, its answer with
counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1960</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed a peti­tion for preliminary injunction, praying that the
Director of Lands be enjoined from proceeding with the sale at pub­lic auction
of a portion of public land including the con­tested area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="10">October
 11, 1960</st1:date>, counsel for Goodrich filed opposition to the petition,
and after due hearing, the court granted the petition for the issuance of the
preliminary injunctive writ, upon petitioner's filing a bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="11">November
 8, 1960</st1:date>, counsel for respondent Good­rich filed a motion for the
dissolution of the writ on the ground that the averments in the petition are
not suffi­cient to warrant its issuance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite opposition from the petitioner, and upon filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> Goodrich,
the preliminary injunction was ordered dissolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 14, 1963, or about four months after the respondents
had filed their answers, a joint motion to dis­miss the petition for certiorari
was filed by the respondents on the ground that the court "has no
jurisdiction to review by writ of certiorari the decisions and acts of the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Director of Lands performed
outside the City of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span>, pursuant to sec­tion
44(h) of the Judiciary Act of 1948".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion was granted, and the petition was dismissed on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1963</st1:date>, the lower court
citing as authority the case of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>, G. R. No. L-17109, decided on <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the order of dismissal, the petitioner elevated the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> for review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of the
contention that the order of dis­missal was erroneous, the petitioner-appellant
stresses </span>on the <span class="SpellE">untimeliness</span> of the motion to
dismiss, stating that venue had been waived since the motion was filed long
after the respondents had filed responsive pleadings, that is, their answers to
the petition for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respond­ents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, on the other hand, insist that the basis for the
motion to dismiss was not improper venue but "lack of jurisdiction based
on Section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act of 1948", which cannot be waived and
may be interposed at any time of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, that the lower court has no
authority to hear and determine the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The question of whether
or not the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> has the
power to "hear and determine the case", and to review the decision of
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Director of Lands -
which would seem to be the main question posed herein - was raised and passed upon
in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Gayacao</u></span><u> vs. Executive Secretary</u>,
<span style="">etc., et al., </span><span style="">G. </span><span style="">R. No. L-21066, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April 30, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court, speaking through Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, there said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The doctrine invoked in support of the theory of
non-jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Castaño</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lobingier</span>,
7 Phil. 91; Acosta vs. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>, L-14598, Oct. 31,
1960; <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining vs. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>,
L-17109, June 30, 1961) are inapplicable, in that those cases involved
petitions for writs of injunction seeking to control the actions of courts or
officers outside the territorial jurisdiction of the respondent courts
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here the sole point in issue <span style="">is </span>whether the de­cision of the
respondent public offi­cers was legally correct or not, and, without going into
the merits of the case, we see no cogent reason why this power of judicial
review should be confined to the courts of first in­stance of the locality
where the offices of respondents are maintained, to the exclusion of the courts
of first instance in those localities where the plaintiffs reside, and where
the questioned decisions are be­ing enforced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It <span style="">is </span>easy to see that <span style="">if </span>the con­tested ruling of the court below
is sustained the same would result not only in hardship to litigants of li­mited
means, practically amounting to denial of access to the courts, but would also
unnecessarily encumber the Manila courts whose dockets are already
overburdened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, since <span class="SpellE">Ortua</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, 59 Phil. 440,
the power of provincial courts of first instance to review administrative
decisions of national officials has been consistently recognized."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
line with the principle laid down in this case, we here­by sustain the
jurisdiction of the lower court over the petition for certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Of course, as stated in
the above-quoted pronouncement, the rule is different in petitions for injunction
which seek to control the actions of courts and officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction or authority of Courts of First
Instance to control or restrain acts by means of the writ of injunc­tion is
limited to acts which are being committed or about to be committed within the
territorial boundaries of their respective provinces and districts (Acosta vs. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>, <u>supra</u>; See also Alhambra Cigar, etc., et
al. vs. National Administration of Regional Office No. 2, etc., et al., L­-20491,
August 31, 1966.) While there was in the case at bar a petition for writ of
preliminary injunction filed sometime after the main petition had been
instituted, the respondent </span><span style="">officials, </span><span style="">particularly the Director of Lands against whom the writ was directed,
had failed to chal­lenge the jurisdiction of the court to issue the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the respondent Goodrich objected to its
issuance, but without raising the question of jurisdiction as a ground for its
opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, since the writ
had been dissolved upon motion and filing of <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
by Good</span>rich, the main petition remains as one for mere "<span class="GramE">CERTIORARI",</span> and the jurisdiction of the court in
issuing the preliminary injunctive writ is no longer <span style="">a </span>question for determination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order complained of is hereby set aside
with costs against the Goodrich International Rub­ber Company, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let the records of this case be reman­ded to
the court below for further proceedings.</p>
