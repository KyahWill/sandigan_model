<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal interposed by 
<span class="SpellE">Severo</span> Romero and 44 others, against the decision of 
the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, dismissing their 
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Filipina <span class="SpellE">Independiente</span>, 
IFI for short, popularly known as the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Aglipayan</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, was founded in 1902 by the late 
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>. From its creation, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span> headed the Church as Obispo <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>, until his death on </span><st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1940"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 1, 
1940</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
church's membership grew from humble beginnings to, about three (3) millions, 
when the present action was instituted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The IFI adopted its own 
doctrines, faith, usages, rituals, practices and discipline, embodied in its two 
official books, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Oficio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Divino</span></u> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A), published and 
promulgated in 1907, and the <span class="SpellE"><u>Doctrina</u></span><u> y 
<span class="SpellE">Reglas</span> <span class="SpellE">Constitutionales</span></u> 
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B),</span> adapted and 
promulgated in 1903. As the official repository, the <span class="SpellE">Oficio</span> <span class="SpellE">Divino</span> is the binding 
authority in all conflicts regarding the practices, faith, doctrines and usages 
of the IFI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In January, 1946, the IFI became 
divided into two factions, one headed by Bishop Santiago A. <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> and the other by Bishop <span class="SpellE">Jsabelo</span> de lo§ Reyes, Jr., defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein, each claiming to be the legitimate Obispo 
<span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>. This division came to a head when 
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein, instituted accounting case 
No. 72183 on February 9, 1946, with the CFI of Manila, against Santiago <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span>, to resolve mainly the question as to who was the 
legitimate Obispo <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> of the IFI. <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span>, in bolstering his claim to the position of Obispo 
<span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>, filed in case No. 72183, a supplemental Answer 
alleging that sometime in August, 1947, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> de 
<span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jr., committed abjuration or apostasy, by 
repudiating and abandoning the fundamental doctrines, faith, rituals, discipline 
and practices of the IFI, as contained in the <span class="SpellE">Doctrina</span> 
y <span class="SpellE">Reglas</span> <span class="SpellE">Constitucionales</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Oficio</span> <span class="SpellE">Divino</span>, without 
the consent and against the will of the Church. Said Supplemental Answer 
enumerated the alleged acts of abjuration perpetrated by De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Civil Case No. 72183 reached the 
Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 6371-R) and also this Court (G.R. No. L-5917, 
decided </span><st1:date month="1" day="28" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jan. 28, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), 
wherein <span class="GramE">We</span> held that <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> 
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jr., was the legitimate Obispo <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> of the IFI. On the issue of abjuration, subject 
matter of the supplemental Answer, this Court rendered the following 
disquisitions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

These questions were raised for the first time on </span><st1:date month="1" day="10" year="1968"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 10, 
1968</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when petitioner filed a supplementary answer alleging that in August, 1947, the 
respondent 'formally joined the Protestant Episcopal Church of America.' The 
alleged doctrinal changes and abjuration took place therefore after this case 
was filed in court, and after the division of the church into two groups had 
occurred, and consequently, they could not have been the cause of the division. 
<u>Under these circumstances, it would seem clear that allegation regarding the 
alleged changes in doctrinal matter or in mailers of faith incorporated in the 
constitutions of the church are entirely irrelevant in the present case</u> x

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the same topic, the Court of 
Appeals made a similar observation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
24, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
after the issue of who was the Supreme Head of the IFI was resolved by this 
Court, the case at bar was instituted by herein plaintiffs-appellants (as a 
class suit), for the recovery of the possession of the properties of the IFI. In 
the complaint, appellants alleged that they (plaintiffs) and other members of 
the IFI throughout the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> are the faithful adherents of 
the IFI, as originally conceived and founded by the late Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>, who, by themselves and/or predecessors-in-interest, 
have contributed property to the IFI. These properties are registered as trust 
properties with the Bureau of Treasury, in accordance with the provisions of 
Commonwealth Act No. 434 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F). 
Plaintiffs-appellants herein posited their cause of action on the adjuration of 
Bishop de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jr., an issue, they claim, not 
definitely resolved by the Court of Appeals and this Court in Case G.R. No. 
<span class="GramE">L-5917.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In substance, the complaint 
alleges that on or about August 5, 1947, <u>defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, together with a so-called Supreme Council of 
Bishops and a General Assembly of the IFI, adopted, without, the will and 
consent of the plaintiffs, a 'Declaration of Faith' and Articles of Religion</u> 
'which are completely different, radically and fundamentally opposed and 
antagonistic to the characteristic and basic doctrines and rituals of the said 
IFI, as set forth and contained in the <span class="SpellE">Doctrina</span> y 
<span class="SpellE">Reglas</span> <span class="SpellE">Constitucionales</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Oficio</span> <span class="SpellE">Divino</span>; that the 
so-called Declaration of Faith and Articles of Religion are not merely a 
restatement of the official doctrines, practices and discipline of the IFI, but 
also projects a radical departure <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and a 
complete repudiation thereof, to which the herein plaintiffs are unwilling to 
believe or subscribe to; that defendant De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, 
in departing from, and repudiating the doctrines, faith, rituals, discipline and 
usages of the IFI, and adopting diametrically opposed and an entirely different 
faith, doctrines, rituals and the like, has divested himself of authority, 
membership, position, connection with or interest in the IFI, and has likewise 
forfeited all rights to continue administering to and using its properties and 
the name IFI; that in spite of demands upon defendant to desist from acts 
inimical to the rights and interests of the IFI, defendant refused and continues 
to refuse to desist from such acts; that plaintiffs being loyal adherents, are 
entitled to the exclusive use of the name of the IFI and to the ownership and 
use of its properties. The complaint ended with the following 
prayer:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

profess and practice the doctrine, faith, rituals, discipline and usages as 
embodied in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Doctrina</u></span><u> y <span class="SpellE">Reglas</span> <span class="SpellE">Constitucionales</span></u> and 
<span class="SpellE"><u>Oficio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Divino</span></u>

defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Plaintiffs further pray for such 
other <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> and remedies as may be deemed just and 
equitable in the premises."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 20, 1957, defendants 
filed a written opposition to the petition for a writ of preliminary injunction, 
anchored on the grounds that the plaintiffs were not representative enough to 
maintain a class suit; that plaintiffs were not entitled to the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for in the complaint, because the matter had 
already been settled by the Supreme Court in case <u>G. R. No. L-5917</u>, 
entitled Santiago <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> vs. Court of Appeals and 
<span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jr., 
promulgated on Jan. 28, 1955, and the action is already barred by<u> <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>; and that the 
return of the possession of the properties to plaintiffs, will cause irreparable 
injury to the three million members of the church. Defendant prayed for the 
denial of the injunction with the reservation to file his answer within the 
<span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period. On </span><st1:date month="10" day="11" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 11, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
plaintiffs-appellants presented a motion to Declare Defendant in Default on the 
ground that he failed to file his Answer within the extended period. An 
opposition was filed by the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, 
alleging, that the extended period had not yet expired. On </span><st1:date month="10" day="28" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 28, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
trial Court issued an order, declaring defendant in default and ordered the 
plaintiffs to present their evidence on </span><st1:date month="11" day="15" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 15, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
motion to set aside this order as well as the motion for reconsideration of the 
<span class="GramE">latter,</span> were both denied in open court. Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has not appealed from the said Orders. As a matter 
of fact, the trial, which consisted in the reception of plaintiffs' evidence, 
proceeded without defendant filing any responsive pleading in the form of a 
Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> or Answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">During the hearing for the 
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction, Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> declared for the plaintiffs and Bishop De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes testified in his own behalf. The trial court found 
that the two groups, essentially differ in their beliefs in many respects; and 
after considering the allegation of the complaint and the evidence submitted, 
held that the present case—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. . . has something to do with 
the faith, ritual, practice, discipline and usages of the IFI as embodied in the 
<span class="SpellE">Doctrina</span> y <span class="SpellE">Reglas</span> <span class="SpellE">Constitucionales</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Offlcio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Divino</span> which the herein defendant had allegedly 
abandoned and repudiated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Because of this abandonment and 
repudiation of the herein defendant, can this Court order the herein defendant

dismissed the complaint, without pronouncement as to

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In their appeal, directly taken 
to this Court, because the issues raised herein are purely legal in nature, 
appellants urged a reversal of the judgment of the lower court, on the following 
grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

having been pleaded by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> either in a 
Motion to Dismiss or in an Answer;<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lower court erred in holding 
that the question of whether or not it could order the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to return to the plaintiffs-appellants the 
properties of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Filipina <span class="SpellE">Independiente</span> has already been settled in the case of 
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> vs. Court of Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, G.R. No. 
L-5917, promulgated </span></span><st1:date month="1" day="28" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 28, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is true that the defense of 
<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> 
is ordinarily pleaded as an affirmative defense, such a plea, however, be raised 
in other ways. In the case at bar, the defense of a prior judgment in the 
accounting case G.R. No.5917 was brought out by defendant in the course of his 
direct examination, at the hearing of appellants' petition for the issuance of a 
writ of preliminary injunction, the judgment on which, the trial court might 
take judicial notice. <span class="GramE">(Sec. 5 Rule 123; III Moran's Rules of 
Court, 1952 Ed., p. 32.)</span> Defendant <span class="SpellE">Defendant</span> De 
<span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes testified "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span>, during 
the case of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> in the courts, raised those 
issues that we have <u>abandoned the faith</u>, that we have <u>become <span class="SpellE">episcopalians</span></u>, <u>that we have changed the faith, the 
rites</u>, <u>ceremonies have changed</u>. But having an <u>overwhelming 
majority</u> of the church, and this being a democratic Church, we were 
perfectly entitled to administer the Church and that I was validly declared the 
Head of the Church and that not one valid vote of the Court of Appeals and the 
Supreme Court was against me."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, we would be indulging 
in sheer technicalities, to say that a court cannot take up the question of 
<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> 
or any defense for that matter, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u>, when it is convinced that, because of a 
lawyer's omission or negligence, an irregularity, illegality or injustice is 
committed. By closing its eyes and/or crossing its arms, when the evidence 
produced by the very plaintiffs-appellants themselves during the hearing of the 
preliminary injunction in the present case, showed that the same subject matter 
and issues were involved in a former case, would be a disservice to the 
administration of justice. Technicalities which will not aid in the just 
determination of <span class="GramE">litigations,</span> should be laid 
aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In order that a judgment can 
operate as a bar to another, the following attendant circumstances should 
concur:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is identity of parties 
between the accounting case (G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-6917) and the instant 
case.</span> It is true that the plaintiffs in the present case are 45 alleged 
residents of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> 
Norte and not Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span>; but a cursory perusal 
of the records, reveals that the instant case is evidently a continuation of the 
rivalry between Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> and Bishop De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, herein defendant. Admittedly, the plaintiffs are 
followers of Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span>; they merely lent their 
names as ostensible plaintiffs in the complaint which they did not sign; their 
whole case rested on the testimony of Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span>, 
who produced and identified the same books and documents produced and presented 
by him in the case L-5917; they served as a front to Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span>; most of them knew nothing about the complaint, as 
in fact, <span class="SpellE">Eulalia</span> Domingo and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Pajaro</span> had denied they were parties to this action and 
disclaimed any interest therein. It should be recalled that Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> in G.R. No. L-5917 filed the case for himself and 
<u>his church</u>, as against respondent Reyes and his group. <span class="GramE">In the summing up of his brief in G.R. No.</span> L-5917, Bishop 
<span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> referred to himself as the "petitioner and<u> 
his church</u>" (p. 160, Petitioner's Brief, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-5917.)</span> This is identical to the recapitulation of his 
brief, in the Court of Appeals, which states "xxx that the appellant and his 
<u>church</u>, on the other hand, have always adhered to and maintained <span class="SpellE">intaet</span> the faith, doctrine, practices and the constitution 
of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Filipina <span class="SpellE">Independiente</span>; xxx." <span class="GramE">(p. 98, Appellants' 
Brief, CA-G.R. No. 6371-R.)</span> <span class="GramE">In G.R. No.</span> L-5917, 
Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> proved for judgment "(c) declaring 
that petitioner <u>and his group</u> are entitled to all the properties, rights 
and privileges of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Filipina <span class="SpellE">Independiente</span> (pp. 178-168 Pet. Brief, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-5917).</span> As appellant in the Court of Appeals, Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> and <u>his group</u> made the very same prayer (p. 
106, Appellants' Brief, CA-G.R. No. 6371-R). All of which go to show that what 
said Bishop has stated in case G.R. No. L-<span class="GramE">5917, that</span> he 
was merely defending himself in an individual capacity, protecting only his own 
personal interest, does not exactly reflect the truth. And considering the fact 
that the 45 plaintiffs-appellants herein "are suing collectively as members of 
the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Filipina <span class="SpellE">Independiente</span>, protecting not only their collective 
interests, but also the interest of the <u>church itself</u>," the conclusion is 
inevitable that they are a portion of the identical group which participated in 
case G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-5917.</span> Moreover, it appearing that 
Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> was not only defending case G.R. No. 
L-5917, in his name but of his church and/or group and that the 45 
plaintiffs-appellants herein are also suing in their own names and the Church 
itself, it stands to reason that they were and are in <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with each other in law or estate; and the judgment 
in G.R. No. L-5917, so long as it remains <span class="SpellE">unreversed</span>, 
should be conclusive upon the plaintiffs-appellants (<span class="SpellE">Oberiano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sobremesana</span>, L-4622,

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is contended by appellants 
that in G.R. No. L-5917, the subject-matter was the right to the office of 
Obispo <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> of the <span class="GramE">IFI,</span> 
while the subject-matter in the instant case, is the properties of the IFI. This 
is not correct. The complaint in the instant case, after praying for a 
preliminary injunction, restraining the defendant from using the name and 
properties of the IFI, also asked that judgment be rendered "(4) Ordering the 
defendant to deliver all properties, papers, effects and other assets of the IFI 
to the plaintiffs and/or person belonging to the IFI and who will continue to

although the case involved the determination as to who is the legal Supreme Head 
of the IFI, with the right to possess, control and administer the church and its 
properties of the control, possession, and administration of all the said 
properties of the IFI were necessarily involved therein. The properties of the 
Church, according to said affidavit, consist principally of more than 300 
churches of strong materials and the lots on which they are created, some of 
which are in the possession of the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, while others are in the possession of the 
defendant-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants contend that no 
similarity is perceivable, between the questions involved in the accounting case 
(G.R. No. L-5917) and the case at bar, arguing that although Bishop De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes' abjuration had indeed been raised in the 
accounting case, it was nevertheless by-passed by the courts which held that it 
was irrelevant and immaterial. Admittedly, the Supreme Court, in affirming the 
decision of the Court of Appeals in the accounting case, made pronouncements 
that the question of Bishop De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes,' alleged 
abjuration or apostasy was irrelevant and immaterial, to the issues involved in 
said case (supra). The cold fact, however, remains, that the trial court and the 
appellate-courts did pass upon and consider the said question, as in fact, 
evidence had been adduced to that effect by both parties. The Court of Appeals 
and the Supreme Court found that "<u>there is no factual basis for the alleged 
abjuration or separation from the IFI of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
Bishop De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and Gerardo M. <span class="SpellE">Bayaca</span></u>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the 
accounting case (G.R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-5917), Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier's</span> |mended supplementary answer averred that in the 
month of August, 1947, Bishop <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">lsabelo</span></span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jr. 
formally joined the Protestant Episcopal Church of America and has ceased to be 
a member of the IFI and has no legal capacity to sue as Obispo <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> of said IFI. In the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 
6371-R), Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> in his first assignment of 
error alleged that the trial court erred in not holding that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jr. and Gerardo M. <span class="SpellE">Bayaca</span>, having abandoned the faith, fundamental doctrines

those others, automatically ceased to belong to said Church and, consequently, 
did not acquire personality to maintain the present action. When Bishop <span class="SpellE">Fonacier</span> filed a petition for certiorari in this Court, to 
review the judgment of the Court of Appeals, he alleged, once more, that the 
latter erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

considering that the essential requisites for its application to the case at

would be useless for a party against whom it can be properly applied to adduce 
such evidence, and accordingly he is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> or

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The plaintiffs-appellants bewail 
that it would be a dangerous precedent to leave them without remedy in court. 
There is no reason for such misgiving. Before the property rights of the parties 
can be passed upon, the question of apostasy or abjuration must first be 
determined by the majority of the members of the Church itself, because such 
question is inherently an <span class="SpellE">ecclessiastical</span> matter. When 
the present complaint was filed, this Court had already decided, in case <span class="GramE">No</span>. L-5917, that no abjuration or apostasy was committed by 
Bishop De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes. As the Court of Appeals has 
succinctly declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It goes without saying that the 
properties of the IFI are held by a religious congregation; that said church 
conies under the second class described in the above-quoted decision; and that 
the <u>numerical</u> <u>majority</u> is on the side of the faction of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, because 7 out of the 13 bishops of the church 
went to them and according to the statement of the Director of National Library, 
issued on May 22, 1947, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> faction was 
composed of 19 bishops and 252 priests whereas appellant's faction had only 10

membership, arc unquestionably <span class="SpellE">ecclessiastical</span> matters 
which are outside the province of the civil courts (45 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., 748-752, 755).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Appellant contends, however, 
that any such changes should be adopted by the church (Memorandum, supra). 
Without resolving whether the amendments in question (Exhibits 54 and 55) 
constitute repudiation of faith or involve wide departure from the fundamental 
and characteristic beliefs or policy of the IFI, we believe, and so hold, that 
the same were legally and validly adopted by the duly constituted <span class="SpellE">Consejo</span> <span class="SpellE">Supremo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Asamblea</span> Magna composed of legitimate members of the IFI,

in the adoption of said amendments, having been ousted by appellant's faction, 
were not authorized to act for the IFI, is untenable. We have already discussed 
and held somewhere in this opinion that the alleged ouster of the aforementioned 
bishops was null and void and, the election of Bishop De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, Jr. as Obispo <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> 
was valid and we did recognize him as the sole and legitimate head of the
