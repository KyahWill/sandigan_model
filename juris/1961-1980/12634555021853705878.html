REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND JUDGE PEDRO NAVARRO, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF
RIZAL, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>ANGELES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On petition for writs of certiorari, prohibi­tion and mandamus,
with preliminary injunction, to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, praying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
to review and thereafter annul the order of respondent Judge denying
petitioner's motion to set aside decision and promulgation thereof; (b) to
restrain respondent Judge from promulgating the decision; and (c) to direct
respondent Judge "to make re-examination of the evidence presented"
during the trial of the case and to render a decision upon the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case which are not <span class="GramE">disputed,</span>
are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Eduardo Jimenez, herein petitioner, together with others, was
charged with homicide in an information, dated May 13, 1960, before the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, criminal case No. 9531 of
said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was heard and tried
before Judge <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>,
presiding one of the branches of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly, the decision prepared signed by Judge <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>
was delivered to the clerk of court on <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="1">January
 16, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date,
the clerk of court issued and served notice on the petitioner to appear in
court on <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1965</st1:date>
for the promulgation of the sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view that January 21, was declared by the President a special holiday, the
promulgation of the decision could not carried out on that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="1">January
 21, 1965</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span> had reached the age of 70 and was retired on that
day from the bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge
Pedro Navarro was immediately designated to take place of Judge <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former
judge ordered that the sentence be promulgated on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1965</st1:date> but for some reason, it was postponed to <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 1, 1965, petitioner Jimenez filed a motion to set aside
decision and promulgation there­of, on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) "That the case was heard and tried
by the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>
and judgment was rendered by him before he retired on January 21, 1965, having
reached the age of 70 years"; and (b) "That said judgment cannot be
validly promulga­ted since it is no longer the official act of a judge either <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> or <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion was opposed by the private prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1965</st1:date>,
the respondent Judge issued an order denying the motion, and ordered that the
decision be promulgated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the petitioner is, that for a decision to be
validly promulgated, the same must not only be rendered by a judge legally
appointed and acting either as <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>
or <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>, but that the decision must also be promulgated
during the incumbency of the judge who penned the decision, reasoning that if
the judge who penned the decision is no longer a judge at the time of the
promulga­tion, there is nothing that can legally be promul­gated because the
decision is no longer an official act of the judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, on the other hand, contends that, while he
is in accord with the view that for a decision to be validly promulgated there
must be a judge legally appointed and acting, either <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> or <u>de</u> <u>facto</u>, it is not necessary
that the promulgation be made during the incumbency of the judge who prepared
and signed the decision, and the deci­sion can be validly promulgated as long
as it was signed and delivered to the clerk of court for promulgation during the
judge's term of office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Revised
Rules of Court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1964</st1:date>,
the rule on promulgation of judgment in criminal cases was Section 6, Rule 116
of the Rules of Court, which reads thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 6.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Promulgation of judg­ment.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The judgment is promulga­ted by reading the
judgment or sentence in the presence of the defendant <u>and the judge of the
court who has rendered it</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendant must be personally present if the conviction is for a grave or less
grave offense; if for light offense, the judgment may be pronounced in the
presence of his attorney or representative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And when the judge is absent or outside of the province, his pre­sence
is not necessary and the judgment may be promulgated or read to the defendant
by the clerk of court." [Underscoring supplied]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1964</st1:date>,
the rule now is Section 6, Rule 120 of the Revised Rules of Court, which reads
thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 6.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Promulgation of judg­ment.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The judgment is promulga­ted by reading the
judgment or sentence in the presence of the defendant <u>and any judge of the
court in which it was rendered</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the defendant is con­fined or detained in another province
or city, the judgment of conviction may be pro­mulgated by the judge of the
Court of First Instance having jurisdiction over the place of confinement or
detention upon the request of the court that rendered the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court promulgating the judg­ment shall
have authority to accept the notice of appeal and to approve the appeal
bond." [Underscoring supplied]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span>, et al., v. Hon. Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
et al., G. R. No.</span> L-21638, <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="7">July
 26, 1966</st1:date>, the facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Four criminal cases, in which there were 6 accused, were tried
jointly by Judge Sta. Maria of the Municipal Court of Manila, and a single
decision was rendered, under date of <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="7">July
 7, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1962</st1:date>, before the decision
could be promulgated, Judge Sta. Maria was appointed to and assumed the
position of judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge German succeeded him as Municipal Judge
of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of the accused, <span class="SpellE">Fung</span>
and Lu, petitioned the court that the <span class="SpellE">unpromulgated</span>
decision of Judge Sta. Maria be declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge German granted the petition, but before
retrial of the cases could be had, Judge German resigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="8">August
 23, 1962</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> was appointed to
the vacant position of Municipal Judge of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, he scheduled the
promulgation of the decision of Judge Sta. Maria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done with respect to the four
accused, but not with regards to defendants <span class="SpellE">Fung</span> and
Lu who did not appear during the promulgation of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter two insti­tuted certiorari and
prohibition proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Manila to restrain
the promulgation of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of First Instance of Manila granted the writ on the ground that since
Judge Sta. Maria was no longer a judge of the Municipal Court, the decision,
prepared and signed by him could no longer be validly promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> of
the Municipal Court ordered a retrial of the four criminal cases which was set
for <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four defendants <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Siu</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> </span>So <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, went to CFI Manila and
applied for a writ to restrain the Municipal Judge from retrying the four
cases, on the ground that as the decision acquitting them had <span style="">already </span><span style="">been promulgated with </span><span style="">respect
to them, a retrial of the cases would subject them to double jeopardy for </span><span style="">the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CFI Manila dismissed the pe­tition for </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">reason that the decision of Judge </span><span style="">Sta. Maria being invalid because its promulgation was effected when the
judge had already </span><span style="">ceased </span><span style="">to be a municipal judge, the same cannot
place the </span><span style="">de­</span><span style="">fendants twice in </span><span style="">jeopardy </span><span style="">for the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The four defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In affirming the appealed decision of the <span style="">Court of First Instance, the Supreme Court in
applying Sec. </span>6, Rule 120 of the Revised Rules, said:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The appellants in effect con­tend that since the decision of
Judge Sta. Maria was signed by him while he was still the judge of the
Municipal Court of Manila where they were tried, its p<span style="">ro</span>mulgation, although made in his absence, was valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this contention, they cite
Section 6 of Rule 116 (now Rule 120) of the Rules of Court, which reads:</p>

<p class="3Q"><span class="GramE">'Sec. 6.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Promulgation
</span>of </u><u><span style="">judgment</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>The judgment is
promulgated by reading the judgment or <u><span style="">sentence
</span>in the </u><u><span style="">presence of the </span></u><u><span style="">defendant </span></u><u><span style="">and any judge of </span>the court in which it
was rendered</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant must be
personally present if the conviction is for a g<span style="">rave </span>of­fense; if for a light offense, the judgment may be
pronounced in the presence of <span style="">his </span>attorney
or represen­tative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <u>when the
judge is absent or outside of the province or city</u>, his presence is not
necessary and the judgment may be promulgated or read to the defendant by the
clerk of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.’ [Underlining supplied]</p>

<p class="2Q">"Pursuant to the above-quoted provisions, the petitioners-appel­lants
argue, the decision of Judge Sta. Maria was promulgated in the presence of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, another judge of the Municipal
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim that the absence of
Judge Sta. Maria during the promulgation does not render the decision he penned
prior to his appointment to the position of judge of the court of first
instance null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is
alleged, the promulga­tion thereof, upon order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
was valid and could be the basis of the defense of double jeo­pardy.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The above-quoted Section 6 of Rule 116 (now Rule 120) of the
Rules of Court, allowing the dis­pensability of the presence of the judge in
the reading of a sentence <u>refers only to the physical absence of the judge,
and not to his inability to be present during the promulgation of the judgment
because of the cessation of or his removal from office</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from the use of the disjunctive
clause "ab­sent or outside of the province or city" in the
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the decision
of the judge may be promulgated even without his presence, as long as he is
still a judge of that court (Luna v. Rodri­guez, 37 Phil. 186; <span class="SpellE">Garchitorena</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Criscini</span>, 37
Phil. 675; <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> v. Commission on Elections, 45 O.
G. 4457; People v. Court of Appeals, G. R. Nos. <span class="GramE">L-9111-9113,
Aug. 28, 1956; People v.</span> <span class="GramE">So, G. R. No.</span> L­8732,
July 30, 1957)</p>

<p class="2Q">"In the present case, what we have is not merely physical ab­sence
of the judge who penned the decision, but the cessation or termination of his
incumbency as such judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> So y
Ortega, (G. R. No.</span> L-8732, <u>supra</u>) this Court ruled:</p>

<p class="3Q">'It is well-settled that to be binding a judg­ment must be duly
signed, and promulgated during the incumbency of the judge who signed it.</p>

<p class="3Q">'In <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> Luna v. Rodri­guez, <u>supra</u>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Barreto</span> signed his decision on Jan­uary 14; two
days later (January 16), he qualified as Secretary of Finance thereby retiring
from the Judiciary; and on January 17, his decision was promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This Court held such decision to be void</u>,
because at the time of the promulgation the judge who prepared it was no longer
a judicial officer.</p>

<p class="3Q">'In criminal proceedings the Rules are more explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They require the judgment to be promulgated
by reading the judgment or sentence in the presence of the defendant and the
judge of the court <u>who</u> has rendered it.' (Rule 116 sec. 6); and although
it is true that it may be read by the clerk "when the judge is absent or
outside the province", it is implied that it may be read, provided he is
the judge therein.</p>

<p class="2Q">It is contended that herein decision was promulgated to all intents
and purposes, when it was delivered to the clerk for promulgation - June
18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That contention was however,
indirect­ly overruled in People v. Court of Appeals, a case similar to this
wherein we regarded com­pliance with sec. 6 of Rule 116 as essential to
promulgation, and held that as the judgment was promulgated <u>after</u> the
judge who penned it had ceased to be judge, it was not legally bind­ing.</p>

<p class="2Q">It is true that in <span class="SpellE">Cea</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> (50 O. G. 5254) this sec­tion was interpreted to mean
that where judgment is one of acquittal, reading in the presence of the
defendant" may be substituted by giving a copy of the decision to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We declared that such act -
delivery copy - amounted to promulgation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case before us, notice that the decision would be read (on Jun
30) was sent out, while Judge <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> was still a
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet no copy of such decision was
given the accused, and he was not informed thereof during said judge's
incumbency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No judg­ment was therefore
validly entered. <span class="GramE">(Cf. <span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> Tan,
48 O. G. 1007).'</span></p>

<blockquote>"Here, in the present case, when the notice for the
promulgation of the decision was sent out, the judge who signed the decision
was no longer the judge of the court, and no copy of the judgment of acquittal
was deli­vered to the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
more reasons, therefore, is there no judgment validly entered in this
case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>Upon the foregoing considerations</b>, <span class="GramE">We</span>
hold that the decision rendered by the retired Judge <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mencias</span> cannot be validly promulgated and acquire a
binding effect for the same has become null and void under the circumstances.</p>
