				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Solicitor General appealed from the decision dated December
8, 1965 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental granting the petition for naturalization filed by petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, on the grounds
that petitioner did not have a lucrative income and that his character wit­nesses
failed to prove that petitioner possesses all the qual­ifications and none of
the disqualifications for Philippine citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1964</st1:date>,
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed his petition for
naturalization, which does not state his six-year residence from 1951-56 in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he finished his high school and obtained his college degree from <span class="SpellE">Silliman</span>, <span style="">University
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. D, S &amp; S-1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His petition also does not include his other
names Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, Jose Tan <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
and Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, Sr. which appear in his marriage
contract, the birth certificates of his two sons, the baptismal certificate of
his eldest son, Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, Jr., his high school
diploma, and his college diploma (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. L, N, N-1, P,
S, &amp; S-1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The notice of hearing (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) does not
re-state verbatim the petition and omitted the allegations concerning his
residence in Iloilo City where he was allegedly born on June 27, 1929 and
admittedly resided until 1934 (p. 16, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.) as he
was baptized only on January 6, 1934 in <span class="SpellE">Pulupandan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K-1, p.
30, <span class="SpellE">rec</span>, of <span class="SpellE">exhs</span>.), his
being of good moral character and his being exempted from filing a declaration
of intention (pars. 2, 10, and 20 of peti­tion <span class="SpellE"><span style="">E</span>xh</span>. A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be stressed that said deficient
notice of hearing was published in the Official Gazette issues of December 28,
1964, January 4, and January 11, 1965 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H) and in
the News Clipper issues of November 8, December 5, and <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1964</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
I) as well as posted on the bulle­tin board of the court (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
G-1).</p>

<p class="BODY">He has not submitted clearances from the NBI, NICA and the City
Attorney, provincial fiscal, provincial commander, city chief of police, and
clerks of court of <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is patent therefore that the petition suffers from various
flaws in violation of the requirements of the law which should be complied with
strictly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, he did not mention his six-year residence in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
from 1951 to 1956 while studying in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Silliman</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. D, S, &amp; S-1) when he was already of age
and the other names he employed, namely Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,
Jose Tan <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, and Jose <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,
Sr. (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. L, N, N-1, P, S, &amp; S-1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He
did not even specifically allege that he resided at </span><st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Isnar</span></span><span style=""> St.</span></st1:street><span style="">, </span><st1:city><span style="">Iloilo</span></st1:city></st1:address><span style=""> City where he studied for several years from 1946.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of hearing did not re-state
verbatim the petition, because it omitted the allegations therein concerning
his residence in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="">
 </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> which the notice of hearing mentions as his
birth­place only, about his good moral character, and his alleged exemption
from filing a declaration of intention (pars. 2, 10, &amp; 20 of the petition, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. G &amp; I).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Time and time again, this Tribunal ruled that such omissions
nullify the petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> likewise failed to
establish a lucrative trade or occupation by clear and convincing evi­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he obtained in 1956 his Bachelor of
Business Administration from <span class="SpellE">SiIliman</span> University, and
he testified that he has been employed as a salesman of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bico</span> and Company which gives him free house, light
and water worth approximately P130.00 (pp. 32, 33, 46, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.)
aside from his salary; his 1962 income tax return (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
J) does not state that his employer is <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> &amp; Co. but Huang Hue <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
who paid him P2,100.00 a year, and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> who paid
him P3,000.00 a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His pretension on
this score is thus rendered doubtful and made more incredible by the fact that
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span style="">is </span>his
elder brother (pp. 19, 37, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.) who is the manager
of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> &amp; Co. (p.
50, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.) and that he never mentioned in the course
of his testimony Huang Hue <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> as his employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, his testimony is not corroborated
by any certification from the Social Security System that he is among the
employees of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> &amp;
Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
or by the corresponding income tax returns of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> &amp; Co. and of Huang Hue <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim that he owns nine (9) shares in <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Uy</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">B<span style="">ico</span></span></span> &amp; Co. worth P1,000.00 does not merit
belief in the absence of the best evidence, which are the certi­ficates of the
stock issued in his name or certified true <span class="SpellE">photostats</span>
thereof or even secondary evidence consisting of a certification to that effect
by the corporate secretary of the firm accompanied by a certified copy of the
articles of incorporation showing its capitalization as well as assets to
confirm his statement that it has not as yet declared any dividend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even his allegation that the house which he
and <span style="">his family occupy </span>would
command a <span style="">rental of P100.00 a month is
as self-serving as his claim that his light and water bills would amount to
over P30.00 a month, in the absence of a description </span>or a <span style="">picture of the said house and receipts of
payment for light and water bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
small town like <span class="SpellE">Pulu­pandan</span>, a family would not pay
over P30.00 for light and water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Further aggravating his lack of credibility is his 1963 income
tax return (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J-1), which shows an income of
P6,000.00 without indicating in the corresponding spaces <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
the nature and source of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is all the more compounded because <span style="">it
is </span>confounded, by his 1964 income tax return (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>,
J-2) showing his alleged income of P5,160.00 broken down into P600.00 as salary
coming from <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> &amp;
Co., P2,400,00 as service fee (no longer salary) from Pedro <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,
lower than his 1962 income of P3,000.00, and P2,160.00 representing service fee
(no longer salary as in 1962) from Huang Hue <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 7 of C.A. No. 473 requires that the two char­acter witnesses
must state in their affidavits supporting the petition that they are Filipino
citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>,
the second character witness of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
has not established satisfactorily that he is a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not submitted indubitable documentary
evi­dence to establish his statement that his father was a natural-born
Filipino citizen, after admitting that his mother is a Chinese citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he is not a competent witness
insofar as the good moral character of the petitioner is concerned; because, he
is a resident of <st1:state><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Victorias</span></st1:place></st1:state>
about 60 kilometers from <span class="SpellE">Pulupandan</span> and since 1956 he
sees the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> only about twice a week
when he allegedly inspects his transportation line in <span class="SpellE">Pulupandan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness is the insurer of the character
of the applicant and much depends on what he knows of the applicant during his
entire period of residence in the country.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>
