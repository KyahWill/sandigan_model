				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The plaintiff Tan Pong filed a complaint (civil case 6269) with
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental,
praying (1) that he be adjudged the illegitimate child of one Mercedes Ro­bles,
said to be a Filipino citizen, by an unknown common-law husband; (2) that the
defendant civil registrar of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City be ordered
to change certain entries in the plaintiff's record of birth respecting (a) his
name which he claims is <span class="SpellE">Morito</span> Robles; (b) the date
of his birth which he avers is January 4, 1948, not February 6, 1947; (c) his
nationality which he asserts to be Fili­pino, not Chinese; and (d) his civil
status which is that of an ille­gitimate child of Mercedes Robles, Filipino
citizen, single, ins­tead of the legitimate child of Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span>
Ai and Co Bee; and (3) that the defendant deputy of the Commissioner of
Immigration be di­rected to cancel not only the alien certificate of
registration is­sued by the Bureau of Immigration which registers him as a citi­zen
of China but as well all records connected therewith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Named parties defendants are the Chinese spouses Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and Co Bee, the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the civil re­gistrar of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and the administrative deputy
of the Com­missioner of Immigration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court's order setting the complaint for hearing on
October 7, 1961 and inviting all interested persons to appear and show cause
why the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> sought should not be granted, was
published once a week for three consecutive weeks in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Civismo</u></span>,
a newspaper of general circulation in the province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1961</st1:date>
the spouses Tan filed an answer, ad­mitting all the material allegations of the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As special defenses, they
alleged that (a) the defendant Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai filed with
the office of the local civil registrar on February 14, 1950 a certi­ficate of
birth for the plaintiff in which he represented that the lat­ter’s place of
birth is <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, his full name Tan Pong, his
date of birth February 6, 1947, his nationality Chinese, and that he is a
legitimate child of the defendants spouses, because the lat­ter sincerely
believed that, by virtue of the document<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
executed in defendant Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai's favor by the
plaintiff's real mother, Mer­cedes Robles, the plaintiff became their own son
to all legal intents and purposes; and (b) the defendants spouses obtained for
the plaintiff an alien certificate of registration and since then up to the
present have reported the plaintiff as a citizen of China and, the defendant
Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai as his father, because they were of the
honest impression that the plaintiff, by virtue of the said document, annex A,
truly became, to all legal intents and purposes, their own Chinese son.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Tambasen</span> (local
civil <span class="SpellE">registar</span>) and Jesus R. Garcia (administrative
deputy of immigration) filed their answer, traversing all the material
allegations of the complaint, and raising special defenses most important of
which is that the plaintiff's suit is not the proper action because it seeks
not merely the correction of a clerical error, but as well the declaration of
the citizenship of the plaintiff, which matter may be threshed out only in an
appropriate proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic of the Philippines, through the Solicitor General,
filed its answer which, besides <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> all the
mate­rial allegations of the complaint, raised the affirmative defense that the
complaint was in reality a triple action for correction the plaintiff's birth
record under article 412 of the Civil Code, for declaratory relief under Rule
66 of the Rules of Court, and for a writ of mandamus under section 3 of Rule
67, all of which cannot be joined in a single complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter the Republic of the Philippines, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Tambasen</span> and Jesus R. Garcia filed a motion to dismiss,
predicated on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the corrections sought are not merely clerical in nature as contemplated in
article 412 of the Civil Code, but on the contrary involve substantial changes
in the plaintiff's birth certificate affecting his identity, name, <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>, paternity and citizenship, as well as the
identity and paternity of the spouses Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and
Co Bee, as parents of the plaintiff; (2) declaration of the plaintiff's
citizenship (as Filipino) through correction of al­leged errors in the birth
certificate arising from alleged erroneous and/or invalid entries in the said
birth certificate, is not counte­nanced in this jurisdiction; (3) to direct the
Bureau of Immigration by mandamus to cancel the plaintiff's alien certificate
of registra­tion and all other pertinent records, is without justification; and
(4) there is in law no proceeding for declaration of Philippine citi­zenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their memorandum of <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="10">October
 25, 1961</st1:date>, the spouses Tan denied the charge made by the assistant
city attorney that they were in connivance with the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1962</st1:date>
the plaintiff filed a pleading which is in the nature both of a <u>memorandum</u>
and an <u>opposition</u> to the mo­tion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because it discovered upon examination of the evidence that the
plaintiff or his guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span> had
not been presented as a witness, the lower court issued on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1962</st1:date> an or­der to reopen the case,
upon previous notice to all parties, to en­able it to probe into the motivation
behind the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1963</st1:date>,
after trial on the merits, the lower court rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered for the plaintiff and
against the defendants, and it is hereby ordered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1) That the Local Civil
Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Baco­lod</span> City cancel the entry in his
office whereby the plaintiff, Tan Pong, is registered as a legitimate son of
the spouses Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and Co Bee, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Deputy Commissioner of Immigra­tion,
Iloilo Branch, is hereby ordered to cause the cancellation in the Alien
Registry of the name of the Plaintiff, Tan Pong, as one of the children of the
de­fendant spouses, and in particular, it is hereby ordered that the
plaintiff's name be <span class="SpellE">striken</span> out from the Master Cards
of registered aliens, No. 123902 and No. 123904."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dissatisfied with the said judgment, the defendants (except the
defendants spouses) appealed to this Court, contending that the lower court
erred (1) in ordering the correction of the plaintiff's status and citizenship
in the birth records of the civil registrar of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City and in the records of the office of the deputy commis­sioner of
immigration in a summary proceeding under art. 412 of the new Civil Code; and
(2) in ordering the correction of the plain­tiff's citizenship in the birth and
immigration records, which cor­rection, in effect, declares him a Filipino,
when there is no pro­ceeding available for the purpose of obtaining such a
declaration of citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court made extensive findings of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1947 Mercedes Robles, a Filipino woman, about three months
pregnant and abandoned by her common-law husband, went to work as a laundress
for one Loreto C. Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about <st1:date year="1947" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1947</st1:date>, while thus employed,
she gave birth to a baby boy whom she called <span class="SpellE">Morito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mercedes offered the child to Loreto C. Tan
but the latter declined as he had children of his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remem­bering, however, that Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and his wife had once expressed, a desire to adopt
one of his children, Loreto C. Tan asked Merce­des if she was willing to give
up her child in adoption to the Chinese couple.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mercedes agreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They then went
to see Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai; thereafter Mercedes Robles, Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai, Loreto C. Tan and the child <span class="SpellE">Morito</span>
convened in Atty. Rafael Guerrero's office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This law­yer then prepared a document in English which purportedly
embodied their agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
translated into the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect for the benefit
of Mercedes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the document in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect was typed in final form by his clerk, Atty.
Guerrero explained:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>its contents to
Mercedes and Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mercedes and Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span>
Ai forthwith signed the document, Loreto C. Tan and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Gentapanan</span>
affixed their signatures as witnesses thereto, and Atty. Guerrero notarized the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original document in the <span class="SpellE">Visa­yan</span> dialect is marked exhibits B and 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">The English version of the document, marked exhibits B-1 and 1-A,
reads as follows:</p>

children, on my own free will, I am giving to said Mr. Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span>

my said son and because of this, said Mr. Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai
will be the one to support said child and when he gets older, he (Tan) will
spend for his education and will love him as if he were his own child and be­cause
of this, I will not interfere and all my paren­tal authority over said child, I
have given to Mr. Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I, Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai, because of the
voluntary will of Mrs. Mercedes Robles and because of my love for the said
child that is being given to me by Mercedes Robles, promise to comply with my
obli­gations as a parent of said child by supporting him well, loving him as my
own child and educating him as well as I can until he reaches the age of majori­ty

<p class="BODY">The boy (<span class="SpellE">Morito</span>) went to live with Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and the lat­ter's family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days later, Mercedes went to Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and informed him that she was leaving for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>;
out of pity Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai gave her P100.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mercedes was never heard of or from again
since then.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court likewise found that Co Bee, the wife of Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai, gave birth on <st1:date year="1948" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1948</st1:date> to a boy, their last child, who was named
Manuel Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This boy died on <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1954</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Morito</span> was named Tan
Pong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pong" means <u>stout</u>
in Chinese.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai, thinking that the boy was
now his child be­cause of the document which he had signed and because this was
so under Chinese law, accomplished a birth certificate (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
4) for Tan Pong, listing him as his and Co Bee's legitimate child born on
February 6, 1947.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai secured an alien certifi­cate of registration for
Tan Pong (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 5), recording the latter as having
been born on <st1:date year="1947" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1947</st1:date>
and naming Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai as his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise included the name of Tan Pong in
his and his wife's list of children in their master cards of registered aliens.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Tan Pong became of school age, Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span>
Ai enroll­ed him in the <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> <span class="SpellE">Tung</span>,

<p class="BODY">According to the court, sometime in 1961, when Tan Pong was about
14 years old, he discovered the document dated <st1:date year="1948" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1948</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">exhs</span>. B and 1)
among the papers of Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and read the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confronted with the document, Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai admitted to Tan Pong that the latter is the same <span class="SpellE">Morito</span> referred to in the document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, having discovered that Tan <span class="SpellE">Yiat</span> Ai and Co Bee were not his real parents and that his
mother was a Filipina by the name of Mercedes Robles, Tan Pong, on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1961</st1:date>, with the assist­ance
of deputy clerk of court <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> M. Mono, filed the
present action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint must be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> brought this
action for the purpose, among others, of establishing his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
and of securing judicial approval of his recognition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he has not <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
Mercedes Robles or the latter's heirs or kin, who are indispensable parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

minor, through her mother and guar­dian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>,
filed a petition with the court of first instance, ac­companied by a certified
copy of a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> document which purpor­ted to be a
recognition by a Japanese citizen - whose whereabouts were unknown - of the <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> of the child though still in the womb of its
mother, praying the said court to approve the acknowledg­ment made
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court dismissed the
petition, hold­ing that the relief prayed for can be obtained only by the
institution of an ordinary civil action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court, affirming, held that it is not sufficient for the person so
recognized to file a mere petition asking the court to approve the
acknowledgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must file an ordinary
civil action against the person who allegedly executed the instrument of
recognition or any of his legal successors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing pronouncement - although made before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the new Civil Code - is still good law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And not with­out reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The supposed recognizing parent must be
afforded opportunity to admit or deny the authenticity or genuineness of the
alleged instrument of acknowledgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, recognition charges him with certain obligations even as it
confers upon the recognized or acknowledged child the corresponding rights – <u>e</u>.<u>g</u>.,
to bear the surname of the recognizing parent, and to receive support and
inherit from such parent.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, the legal heirs or successors of the supposed
acknowledging parent should likewise be given opportunity to impugn - if they
have good grounds to do so - the alleged document of acknowledgment, because
they stand to suffer diminution of their share in the heredi­tary portion of
the alleged recognizing parent.</p>

<p class="BODY">But assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the
present action is legally sufficient for the purpose of establishing the
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
and of securing judicial approval of his recognition, still it cannot, even if
successfully concluded, be used as a spring­board to secure a direct
declaration of the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, his complaint also
seeks a ruling that he is a Filipino citizen, because it likewise prays the
lower court "to order the defendant Local Civil Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City to cor­rect the entry of his birth in the
civil register so as to state . . his nationality as Filipino, ..." In
fact, because the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> believes that
his supposed mother was not a woman of visible means and that she is moreover
already dead, having been unheard of or from for more than 13 years, it would
appear that he is interested more in establishing Philippine citizenship (by
proving illegitimate <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> to a Filipino mother)
than in establishing a right under the civil law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to stress, there is no authorized
procedure for direct declaration of citizenship, and the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should not be allowed to secure by indi­rection
what the law does not allow directly.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not of course to be understood as saying that the
political status of citizenship may not at all be established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can as an incident to the adjudication of
a real and <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversy<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> -
for example, in a case where the plaintiff or pe­titioner asserts a right exercisable
only by a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There the
court can correctly declare that he is entitled to exer­cise such right (or
privilege) because he is a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But surely a court cannot, in an action where the plaintiff seeks to
establish his <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> and status as an acknowledged
illegiti­mate child of a Filipino woman, who is not made a party to the action,
and to impugn his status as a legitimate child of Chinese parents, make a
pronouncement that said plaintiff is the recog­nized natural child of a
Filipino woman, and, on this basis alone, declare and adjudge him a Filipino
citizen and order the corres­ponding correction of his birth and immigration
records.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed, and
the complaint is hereby dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
