				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">From the order of the
Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Province (Case </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">6801) dismissing his petition </span><span style="">for a </span><span style="">writ of certiorari against the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>,
Branch II, and <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldovino</span>
for lack of jurisdiction, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinza</span>
has appealed directly to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The original petition in the <span style="">court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> sought a declaration that the City </span>Court
of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> had no jurisdiction to <span style="">proceed with its Criminal Case No, 1246 </span>charging
petitioner with <span style="">perjury, and that said
court be ordered </span>to dismiss <span style="">the
case, </span>without action on <span style="">the
merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>bases <span style="">for his action, petitioner (now appellant) <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinza</span> claimed that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1. <span class="GramE">The</span> information filed in the said
criminal case, Annex A, is null and void, because the certifi­cation of the
Fiscal as to the holding of the corresponding preliminary investigation is not
under oath;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. There was no valid preliminary investigation pursuant to Rule
112, Section 14, of the New Rules of Court, because the accuse, who had not
waived his right to a preliminary investigation, was not given the chance to be
present or to be represented by counsel at the preliminary investigation and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. There is a<span style=""> </span>prejudicial
question involved in the case, which necessarily suspends further proceeding
therein, on account of the existence of a civil action (Civil Case No. 604-G)
between the accused, or the one hand, and the complaining witness <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldavino</span> and his wife
Milagros Nico­demus, on the other, before the Third Branch of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Gumaca</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, involving Lot No. 2343-A of <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, Cadastre, which is also involved in the supposed
affidavit of the accused <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinza</span>,
subject matter of the informa­tion in the aforesaid criminal case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents in the court
below (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein) moved to </span><span style="">dismiss </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">ground that the Court </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">First Instance had no </span><span style="">supervisory
jurisdiction </span><span style="">over </span><span style="">the City </span><span style="">Court of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lucena</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">and the motion was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant submits the
following assignment of errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1. The trial court erred in holding that it has no jurisdiction
over this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. The trial court erred in not declaring respondent <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldovino</span> guilty of
contempt of court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first assignment of
error is plainly unmeritorious, and we find </span><span style="">correct the </span><span style="">reasoning of
the respondent Judge, Hon. Gabriel V. Valero, in his decision </span><span style="">under </span><span style="">appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The crime of perjury, charged in Criminal Case No. 1246 of
the court of the respondent city judge, from which the instant suit arose, is penalized
under Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code with <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>pris</u><u><span style="">ion</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> in its minimum
period, and, pursuant to the provisions of Section 87, Republic Act 296, as
amended, falls within the con­current jurisdiction of the municipal or city
court and of the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the court of the res­pondent city judge has taken cognizance of
Criminal Case No. 1246 to the exclusion of all, other courts, particularly the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, judgment in said
case will not be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to this Court (CFI) but
directly to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be,
pursuant to the pro­visions of the last paragraph of Section 87 of Republic Act
296, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘All cases filed under the next preceding paragraph with municipal
judges of capitals and city court judge snail be tried and de­cided on the
merits by the respective munici­pal judges or city judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Proceedings had shall be recorded and
decisions therein shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> direct to the
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be' (Italics supplied)</u>
--</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">because</span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Courts of First Instance shall have appellate jurisdiction over all
cases arising in city and mu­nicipal courts, in their respective provinces,
except over appeals from cases tried by municipal judges of provincial capitals
or city judges pur­suant to the authority granted under the last para­graph of
Section 87 of this <span style="">Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">(Section 45, Rep.
Act 296, as amended by Rep. Act 2513.</span><span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>"And <span style="">according to
Section 30 of the </span>same Republic Act 296, as amended -?<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The Court of Appeals shall have original juris­diction to issue
writs of mandamus, <u>prohibition</u>, <u>injunction</u>, <u>certiorari</u>,
habeas corpus, and all other auxiliary writs and process <u>in aid of its
appellate jurisdiction.</u>’</p>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>“</span>It is <span style="">clear, therefore, </span>that the present action falls within the
jurisdiction <span style="">of the Court of Appeals </span><span style="">as </span>an aid in its appellate
jurisdiction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant relies on <span style="">the
provisions of Section 4, Rule 65, </span>of the Revised Rules of Court, to <span style="">the effect that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Where petition filed</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition (for certiorari, prohibition or
mandamus) may be filed in the Supreme Court, or if it relates to the acts or
omissions of an inferior court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in
a Court of First Instance having jurisdiction thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals
if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's reliance <span style="">upon
the foregoing rule is misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First,
because the Rules of Court do not define the Jurisdiction of the various
Tribunals of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and <span style="">the quoted provision evidently </span>assumes
that such jurisdiction exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, <span style="">as pointed out in the appealed decision, the
Court of </span>First <span style="">Instance no
supervisory jurisdiction over the <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City Court,
since the decisions of the latter are directly <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
</span>to <span style="">the Court of Appeals or to
this Supreme Court, as the </span>circums<span style="">tances
may warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the rule invoked
speaks of "acts or omissions of an inferior court”, and under the Judiciary
Act the City Court (as contrasted to an ordinary Municipal Court is <u>not</u> <u>inferior</u>
to the Court of First instance in cases within their concurrent jurisdiction,
for then the City Court acts with like jurisdiction as the Court of First
Instance "(Republic Act 296, section 87(c), paragraph 4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second assignment of
error is equally without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant charges that</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellee</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Aldovino</span>, without being a member of the bar, filed an
answer not only for himself but also for his co-respondent, Judge <span class="SpellE">Mogol</span> of the City </span>Court<span style=""> of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>; that this act is in contempt of
court, since it amounts to practicing Law without authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unquestionable that <span class="SpellE">Aldovino</span>,
as respondent, could file an answer for both himself and the judge, under
Section 6 of Revised Rule 5, providing that --<o:p></o:p></span></p>
