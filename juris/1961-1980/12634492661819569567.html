was shot to death on <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="12">December 23,
 1958</st1:date> in­side its compound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assailant and his companions fled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A complaint for the murder of <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> was filed on
<st1:date year="1959" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1959</st1:date> in the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City Municipal Court against <span class="SpellE">Cle­mente</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> and two others unknown. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Subsequently, this was amended to charge the
following: (1) Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Jarava­ta</span>; (2) <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>; (3) <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>; (4) Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>; (5) Segundo Santos; and (6) Rafael Fernandez.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>,
in April of 1959, surrendered to the <span class="GramE">Philippine Constabulary.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="4">April
 23, 1959</st1:date>, he signed an affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K)
before the Philippine Constabulary ad­mitting participation in the Flores
killing and implicat­ing his co-accused, thus: Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>
as the master­mind; <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>
as the <span class="SpellE">contactman</span>; Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
as the executioner; Segundo Santos as <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span> body­guard
who taught Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> how to use the gun; and
Rafael Fernandez as the one who gave him (<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>) a knife.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">An information</span> for the same offense was
filed on <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1959</st1:date> in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasi­nan</span> against the
six accused aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> was later
discharged to be a State witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial - the remaining accused having pleaded not guilty -
the Court of First Instance on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1963</st1:date> rendered a judgment of conviction, sentencing all the five
accused to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to
jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, however, <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> moved for withdrawal of their ap­peals; <span class="GramE">We</span> granted said motions on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1965</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1966</st1:date>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This left Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Jara­vata</span>,
Segundo Santos and Rafael Fernandez as the only appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Raised by the appeal are chiefly two issues: First, did the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> err in giving credence to State wit­ness <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>’ testimony?
Second, is the penalty to be alike for all if found guilty?</p>

<p class="BODY">State witness <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> testified that on <st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1958</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> contacted him in his house at <span class="SpellE">Quitakit</span>
and brought him to Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span>
house, in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>, Segundo Santos
and Rafael Fernandez, <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> asked him to kill
Aurelio Flores, offering him a P150.00-a-month job and additional money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Jara­vata</span> said, was making trouble with the union <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> headed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span> reply was that he would try.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jara­vata</span> gave a
.45-cal. pistol to <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> for <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> to use; and he told them that one Francisco <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span> would point <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> out to
them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>,
accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>, went to the Carried Lumber Co.
compound that night and on two other times; they did not find <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>;
on said occasions, <span class="SpellE">Ray­mundo</span> slept in <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span> house.</p>

<p class="BODY">About a week later, on <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1958</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> again fetched him from
his house; on their way to <span class="SpellE">Dagu­pan</span> City, they met <span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span> grandson, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Da­doya</span> proposed
the same thing to Gregorio, who came along and promised to try.</p>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, they went to <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span> place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ja­ravata</span> made the same proposal to Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> and
Fernandez, who were again present, urged him to ac­cept.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
said he will try.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then agreed
that Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> would use <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span>
.45-cal. pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> said that he did not know how to use the pistol,
Segundo Santos undertook the task of teaching Gregorio how to use it upon
orders of <span class="SpellE">Ja­ravata</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span> was again mentioned as the
one who would point out <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night, they slept in <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span>
place.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="12">December
 23, 1958</st1:date>, at about seven in the evening, <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>,
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> and he (<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>) went to Carried Lumber Co. compound to kill <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> had a knife;
he, too, had a knife, given to him for this purpose by Rafael Fernandez; and
Gregorio had the .45-cal. pistol.</p>

<p class="BODY">They posted themselves behind a pile of logs inside the
compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span>
approached them and told them that <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> had passed by
and was near the gate; <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, after talking to one Ben <span class="SpellE">Puga</span>, came around again and passed by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio immediately followed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noticing this, <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>
turned around, at about five meters away from Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he did so, Gregorio shot him twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Flores</st1:place> fell; Gregorio
shot him five times more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three of
them fled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio handed the gun to <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> who threw it to a canal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some time afterwards, he asked <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>
for money but the latter said he could not give him yet, as he (<span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>) was being investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> later gave <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> P95 of which he kept P25 and gave P70 to
Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1959</st1:date> he surrendered to the Philippine
Constabulary at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and there later he
executed his affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Francisco <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span>,
a crane ope­rator of Carried Lumber Co., testified that three weeks before
December 23, 1959, he was in <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span> house; that
there, in the presence of Segundo Santos, <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>
told him of his plan to kill Flores for the reason that Flores was making
trouble in the union, and that Flores and <span class="SpellE">Puga</span> had
attempted to kill him.</p>

<p class="BODY">A week later, on <st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1958</st1:date>, at about seven in the evening - said witness further
testified - he saw <span class="SpellE">Da­doya</span>, Segundo Santos and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> in the Carried
Lumber; he saw <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> give <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> a gun and a knife and heard him caution <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> to be careful in shooting <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">And - continued <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span> - on <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1958</st1:date> at six in the
evening, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> was in the Carried
Lumber; <st1:city><st1:place>San­tos</st1:place></st1:city> told him that the
person to kill <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> was already in <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At seven that evening, he saw <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> hidden behind a pile of logs in the Carried Lumber
premises; he asked them what they were doing and they said they were waiting
for somebody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>
later pointed out <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> to Gregorio and the latter shot
<st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, twice, then several times more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balolong</span> de­nied
that he was the one who pointed <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> out.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also testifying for the prosecution, the deceased's wife, Elvira
Flores, stated that in the evenings of De­cember 18 and 20, 1958, she saw two
persons roaming around the lot of Carried Lumber Co., for about five hours,
watch­ing, near a pile of logs, their house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told her husband about it and he in turn reported the same to a
compa­ny security guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She identified <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span> as one of the men.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She could not remember the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also presented Assistant Chief of Po­lice Victor
Arenas of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> and Fiscal Jose <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>
to show that on March 5, 1959, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, then
detained in jail, verbally confessed regarding <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span>
proposal, Santos' teaching him to use the gun to kill Flores, and Fernandez'
giving <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> a knife for the mission; but that
later, on advice of counsel, he refused to sign the written confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the above testimonies, <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>
denied the accusation against him, claiming that he was at home from <st1:date year="1958" day="15" month="12">December 15-23, 1958</st1:date> and did not go
out because his wife gave birth at the end of November.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
denied participation in the killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, he de­nied his alleged verbal confession and said denial was
supported by his uncle and his lawyer, present during the incident of his
investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> in his
testimony stated that he had no grievance with the deceased <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>;
that it was one Simeon <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, not <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>,
who caused him to be investigated for alleged illegal disbursement of union
funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Flores</st1:place>,
however, <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> further said, was the leader in
maltreating some people; that Ben <span class="SpellE">Puga</span>, <st1:place>Flo­res</st1:place>'
bodyguard, stabbed one <span class="SpellE">Arbolante</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to Santos and Fernandez, <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> admits knowing them; he also knows the witness <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span>; but he denies that he knows <span class="SpellE">Dadoya</span>;
he further admits that he filed a criminal case against Flo­res and <span class="SpellE">Puga</span> because <span class="SpellE">Puga</span> hit him with a
piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>, however, denied all testimonies linking him to
the killing of <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Segundo Santos admitted he knows <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>;
claimed that <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span> brother, Cornelio, is his
employer; de­nies that he was present in the alleged plot to kill <st1:place>Flo­res</st1:place>;
and denies that he taught Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> to use the
gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rafael Fernandez also denied complicity in the al­leged plan to
kill <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>; said he knows <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
but not <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> nor <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span>
nor Gregorio nor <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants merely denied the accusations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could not explain why <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> would implicate
them and accuse them of <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>' murder and testify
against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found <span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span> testimony credi­ble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason to disturb its finding has been
shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Credibility of witnesses is best
determined by the trial judge (People v. <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>,
L-14520, February 26, 1965; People v. <span class="SpellE">Lumayag</span>,
L-19142, March 31, 1965).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>’
testimony is moreover corroborated by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Balolong</span>
and Elvira Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Jaravata's</span> ill-feelings towards <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>
<span class="GramE">is</span> shown by the fact that <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>
sided with <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> in his union dis­pute against <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> and the fact that <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>
filed a criminal case against Flores and <span class="SpellE">Puga</span>. </p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the penalty, the proof of conspiracy is beyond
reasonable doubt; <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span> was the mastermind of the plan;
Segundo Santos, always present when the plot was discussed, trained and
instructed Gregorio, the trigger-man, on how to use the gun; and Rafael Fernan­dez,
twice present during the plot's formulation, gave <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
Santos a knife for the purpose of their mission to kill Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, all of them are liable as
principals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, treachery attended the commission of the of­fense, absorbing
nighttime; for the assailants hid be­hind a pile of logs under cover of darkness;
the victim was approached from behind and shot as he turned around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there was evident premeditation,
since the accused repeatedly plotted the commission of the offense over a
period of several weeks and, on at least two occa­sions, made preliminary
efforts to carry it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
aggravating circumstances, treachery and evident premedi­tation, are alleged in
the information and thus, either one suffices to qualify the offense to murder;
and there being no mitigating circumstance, the remaining aggravat­ing
circumstance should have put the penalty in its maxi­mum period, namely,
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of the requisite number
of votes, however, the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
is imposed, together with the indemnity of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
for the heirs of the deceased and costs imposed below.</p>

affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
