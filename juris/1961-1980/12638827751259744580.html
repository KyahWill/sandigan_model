				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <i>certiorari</i> taken by Arturo F.W. <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> -- hereinafter referred to as petitioner -- from
the resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 41488, denying his
petition for leave to file an amended petition after the original petition for <i>mandamus</i>,
dated June 26, 1968, had been dismissed for not being sufficient in form and
substance and after the motion for reconsideration of the dismissal had been
denied, on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for relief from the judgment of <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1966</st1:date>, was filed after the
lapse of 60 days from the time the defendant in Civil Case 63494 of the Court
of First Instance of Manila, Branch XXIII, <span class="GramE">now</span> petitioner,
learned of said judgment sometime in September, 1966 (See pp. 37 and 41, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
petition for relief was filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1967</st1:date>, or more than one hundred and twenty (120) days
thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record on appeal shows that although the
notice of appeal was filed within the 30-day <span class="SpellE">reglamentary</span>
period and the time for filing the record on appeal was extended beyond the
said period, the appeal bond was not filed simultaneously with the notice of
appeal but eleven (11) days later, or on April 15, 1968, which was the 35th day
after notice by the petitioner of the order denying the petition for
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of appeal from said
order of denial was filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="4">April 4,

the appeal bond was filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="4">April 15,

filing the appeal bond was <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="4">April 10,
 1968</st1:date>, the said bond was filed five (5) days late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was not, therefore, perfected in
due time and the disapproval thereof by the trial court <span class="GramE">was</span>
perfectly legal" (pp. 178-179, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that in Civil Case No. 63494 of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, entitled "General Milk Co. (Phil.), Inc.,
plaintiff, versus Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, doing business
under the name of 'Maria Belen Store', defendant", plaintiff therein -
hereinafter referred to as private respondent - filed on December 3, 1965 a
complaint against petitioner to recover the sum of P80,933.00, representing the
value of milk products obtained on credit by the latter from the former on
various dates, plus 25% of the said amount, which is equivalent to P20,233.25,
as attorney's fees.</p>

prescribed by the Rules of Court, on <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="3">March
 10, 1966</st1:date>, the trial court, at private respondent's behest, declared
the petitioner in default and directed the private respondent to present its
evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> On <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

with interest at 12% per annum from October 14, 1965, the date of the letter of
demand, until fully paid, plus P1,500.00 for attorney's fees and the

not acquire jurisdiction over his person since he was not properly served with
summons and processes of the court;</p>

by fortuitous event - fire.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1967</st1:date>,

were properly served upon the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this purpose, the trial court appointed a commissioner to receive
the evidence of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1968</st1:date>,

<blockquote>"Francisco G. Santos, Deputy Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, testified that he served the summons in this case
upon defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> personally on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1966</st1:date> at defendant's store
in <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>
testified that he did not receive the summons in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1966</st1:date>, when the summons was allegedly served
upon him, he was in his fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
further testified that the person upon whom the summons was served was his
22-year old son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, who signed his name on the original of the
summons and <span class="GramE">that</span> said <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> was a mentally retarded person and not a
person qualified to receive summons for him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. Carlos Vicente testified that he had examined <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> sometime in
August, 1967 and after applying upon him the <span class="SpellE">Wachsler</span>
<span class="SpellE">Belavue</span> Intelligence Test he found out that the
patient was 'in social remission and has inadequacies on his emotions; that the
behavior of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> is that of an individual who
does not associate much and his intelligence quotient belongs to the borderline
mentality of a person between 7 and 10 years old'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming that the summons in this case was received by <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, son of the
defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, the question to be
determined is whether said <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> is a person of sufficient intelligence and
discretion to receive summons for his father, the defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>
admitted that his son was 22 years old and has reached the sixth grade</u>;
that his son <u>helped in the store by placing goods</u> inside the showcases
and <u>do(<span class="SpellE">ing</span>) some errands such as buying things</u>;
that <u>once in a while his son signed his name to checks exchanged the cash
with agents who were delivering goods to his store and spends the proceeds that
on one occasion his son got P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a pair of shoes
and gave money and suiting to his classmates and friends</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Taking into account this testimony of the, defendant himself,
<u>the Court believes that his son <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> is not mentally incompetent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that his son could imitate
defendant's signature with creditable similarity and be exchange it for cash
with agents dealing in defendant's store and spending the proceeds thereof
shows a sufficient degree of intelligence and discretion</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. Carlos Vicente saw <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
only three (3) times and had not treated him as a patient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doctor observed <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> at the behest of the defendant while the
petition for relief was already pending in this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Drs. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
Mendoza and Juliana <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> who treated <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> prior to May,
1967, and the certificate which they issued, were not presented in Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><u>"<span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> was living with his father</u>, the defendant, <u>and
helping him in the store</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,

the Sheriff served the summons at defendant's <span class="SpellE">atore</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> appeared to be
the most responsible person in the store</u> otherwise the Sheriff would not
have served the summons upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Sheriff had been a sheriff since 1960 and it can be assumed that he can
determine whether the person receiving the summons is of sufficient
intelligence and discretion to receive it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The Court notes that <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> was not presented by the defendant as a witness
thus depriving the plaintiff of an opportunity to cross-examine him and test
his intelligence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, <u>on </u><st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="5"><u>May 19, 1967</u></st1:date><u>
the Court verbally directed the attorney for the defendant to bring <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> to the Court for
cross-examination by plaintiff's counsel</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court further notes that in the verified petition for
relief defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span> stated under oath
that the initial 'OJ' appearing in the summons was neither his nor that of his
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only during the
presentation of the evidence that the said defendant tried to establish that
the signature appearing in the summons was that of his son, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, and not <span class="SpellE">xxxxx</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whether the Court accepts

upon the defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, or the Court
accepts the claim of the defendant that the summons was received by his son <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, <u>the Court
holds that the defendant was properly served with summons was</u>, therefore, <u>correctly
declared</u> in default after said defendant failed to file his answer within

its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1968</st1:date>,

</span>Respondent Court of Appeals denied his said petition as well as his

out of time; and that the appeal of defendant from the order of the trial court
was not perfected on time and, hence, the disapproval thereof by the trial
court was perfectly legal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the foregoing
resolution having been denied by the Court of Appeals in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="8">August 6, <span class="GramE">1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> he now comes to this Court, assailing the actuations not
only of the Court of Appeals but also those of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
as hereinabove pointed out.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first - and pivotal -
issue to be resolved in this appeal is:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not the petitioner was properly served with summons, thereby
vesting the court, <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> with, jurisdiction to declare him in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that issue is answered in
the affirmative, then the order of default, together with the default judgment
and the order of execution issued by the court <u>a quo</u> must all be
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, if said
issue is answered in the negative, then the order of default, as well as the
default judgment and the order of execution must all be set aside and the case
remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for further proceedings upon its
merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE dispose of this issue adversely to petitioner in a three-step
analysis.</p>

<p class="BODY">First - The record shows that the petitioner filed his answer to
the complaint on <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said answer he did not expressly object to
the jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> over his person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, he is deemed to have voluntarily
appeared, and he thereby gave the trial court jurisdiction over his person, and
an objection thereafter made upon the ground that he was not properly served
with summons will not avail him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
then made too late (Sec. 23, Rule 14, Revised Rules of Court; Flores vs. <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span>, 37 Phil. 746, 750-751).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court notes also that petitioner filed a motion to dismiss
on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1968</st1:date>, ten (10)
days after he received a copy of the order of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
denying his petition for relief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, such motion to dismiss was filed out of time, and may therefore
be denied outright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> acted correctly in not granting the same for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second - It is elementary that venue is <span class="SpellE">waivable</span>,
since it is a procedural, not a jurisdictional, matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the parties agreed that
the courts of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> shall have
jurisdiction to try this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
agreement is evidenced by sales contracts duly presented at the <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> hearing of <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1966</st1:date>, whereby the parties submitted themselves
to the jurisdiction of the courts of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for any legal action arising out of their transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the parties agreed to add the
courts of Manila as tribunals to which they may resort in the event of suit,
and not only to the courts either of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, of which
private respondent is a resident, or of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
where petitioner resides, pursuant to Section 2(b) of Rule 4 of the Revised
Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third - The Court of First Instance of Manila is a court of
general jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it is to
be presumed that, before it issued its order declaring petitioner in default,
it took care to see that the summons and complaint had been delivered to and
received by petitioner in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this is precisely what the trial court did by issuing the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1967</st1:date>, wherein it stated:</p>

<blockquote>"It is necessary to receive evidence on whether the summons
and judgment had been properly served upon defendant Arturo <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>" (p. 39, rec.).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether or not summons and complaint were
actually received by petitioner is one of fact and was actually ventilated in
the trial court, which correctly found that petitioner was properly served with
the summons and copy .of the complaint through his 22-year old and competent
son, as embodied in its order of <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second issue posed by
petitioner is his claim that he filed his petition for relief from the default
judgment dated <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1966</st1:date>,
within the period set forth in Section 3 of Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> rule of court provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 3.</span> <span class="GramE"><u>Time
for filing petition; contents and verification</u>.</span> - A petition
provided for in either of the preceding sections of this rule must be verified,
filed within sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment,
order, or other proceedings to be set aside, and not more than six (6) months
after such judgment or order was entered, or such proceeding was taken; and
must be accompanied with affidavits showing the fraud, accident, mistake, or
excusable negligence relied upon, and the facts constituting the petitioner's
good and substantial cause of action or defense, as the case may be."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that petitioner filed his petition for relief on
<st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1967</st1:date> (p. 285,
rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted having learned of the
default judgment on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1966</st1:date>,
when the same was being executed by respondent sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
rule, petitioner had sixty (60) days after <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1966</st1:date> within which to file his petition for
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he filed his petition for
relief only on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1967</st1:date>,
136 days, or 4 months and 16 days after he knew on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1966</st1:date> of said default judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then again, there is evidence in the record that the default
judgment from which the petitioner seeks to be relieved was entered on <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1966</st1:date> (pp. 46, 49, Brief for
Respondents, p. 432, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six (6)
months, or 180 days, from <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1966</st1:date>,
would be <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed his petition fur relief on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1967</st1:date>, or after the lapse
of 245 days, or 8 months and 5 days from <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner's remedy is totally lost.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE reiterate what WE said in the case of <span class="SpellE">Dirige</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Biranya</span> (L-22033, July 30, 1966, 17 SCRA 840,
850):</p>

<blockquote>"We therefore rule that a petition for relief must, amongst
others, be filed within six months from the date judgment is entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rulings inconsistent herewith are hereby
expressly overruled."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner invokes the doctrine laid down by this Court in the
case of People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> &amp; Housing Corporation
vs. <span class="SpellE">Tiongco</span> (12 SCRA 471, 475), where, despite the
fact that the petition for relief was presented outside of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of sixty (60) days from notice of the
judgment, nevertheless, due to peculiar circumstances obtaining in the case, WE
considered the rule to have been substantially complied with and the petition
for relief from judgment was seasonably filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that case, the delay in the filing of the petition for relief
consisted only of two (2) days from receipt of the judgment by defendant's
former counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, as
pointed out above, the delay consisted of seventy-seven (77) days, or two (2)
months and seventeen (17) days after petitioner learned of the judgment, and
sixty-six (66) days, or two (2) months and six (6) days, after entry of
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, relief from judgment or order, being an act of
grace, is premised on equity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should,
therefore, be granted only in exceptional cases (<span class="SpellE">Dirige</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Biranya</span>, supra).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On top of this petitioner must prove excusable negligence and the
existence of good and substantial defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that he became sick after he consulted then
Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> (now City Court Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>) of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record suggests how long his
sickness disabled him or prevented him from filing a timely petition for
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even a medical certificate
did he produce to prove his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
sum, he failed to make a clear case of excusable negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not discharged his burden to clear
himself of the imputation of want of due diligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His case must therefore fall.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even the merits of his alleged good and substantial defense will
not carry the day for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims
"the goods mentioned in plaintiff's ten causes of action and received in
concept of consignment credit were all burned in the fire of July 31,
1966", through no fault of his but by <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>
(Joint Affidavit of Merit, p. 32, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In effect, he wants this Court to believe that since <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1964</st1:date>, when he began receiving
milk products from private respondent up to and including <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1965</st1:date>, when he received the last
shipment of 200 cans of Liberty Milk, worth P5<span class="GramE">,230.00</span>,
he never made any sale, until ALL were burned in said fire of <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, while it is true that petitioner stated in his affidavit
of merit that a certificate was issued by the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, the record does
not bear any such certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE
therefore have no means of knowing just what that certificate was all
about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does the record show that
the goods lost in said fire were precisely those consigned to him during the
period from <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1964</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1965</st1:date> (Complaint, pp.
63-66, ibid.), nor does it show any evidence of the extent of his actual loss,
as reflected in his income tax return for the year 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">By statutory requirement, an appeal from the Court of First
Instance to the Court of Appeals may be taken by serving upon the adverse party
and the filing with the trial court within thirty (30) days from notice of
order or judgment, a notice of appeal, an appeal bond, and a record on appeal
(Sec. 3, Rule 41, Revised Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">The filing of a notice of appeal within the thirty-day period
prescribed in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> rule is necessary for
perfecting an appeal and conferring appellate jurisdiction upon the appellate
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if the notice of
appeal, or the appeal bond, or the record on appeal is not filed within the
aforementioned period, the appeal shall be dismissed (Sec. 13, Rule 41, <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is mandatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the record shows that on <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1968</st1:date> (p. 53, rec.), petitioner received a copy of
the order of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
Rules, he should have filed his notice of appeal, an appeal bond, and a record
on appeal within thirty (30) days from and after <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thirty (30) days from <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">March 1,
 1968</st1:date> would be <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="3">March 31,
 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed only
a notice of appeal on April 4, 1968 (see upper right-hand corner of Annex
"N", p. 94, rec.; p. 8, Supplemental Brief for Petitioner), but did
not file any motion for extension of time to file the appeal bond and record on
appeal before the lapse of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then and there, the trial court
could have validly ordered the striking out of the notice of appeal and
simultaneously dismissed the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, the trial court allowed the petitioner to file his record on
appeal, which he did on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>April 15, 1968,
but which was 15 days too late, and his appeal bond, which the trial court
received on April 30, 1968 (p. 236, rec.), 30 days too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In doing so, the trial court obviously
exercised its sound discretion in the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But WE note with displeasure that petitioner abused the liberality of
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> by filing the appeal bond way beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period and by deliberately refusing to obey
its order of May 20, 1968, which in effect required him to show in his amended
record on appeal the date when he received a copy of the order of the court
sought to be appealed from, by making it appear in the corresponding amended
record on appeal that he received the copy of the order on March 5, 1968 when
he knew fully well that he did not receive it on that day but on March 1, 1968
(see order, p. 131, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal is patently frivolous and designed to impede justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for petitioner knowingly made untruthful statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insists that he filed an appeal bond on <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1968</st1:date>, when the
incontrovertible evidence of its filing with the trial court appears clearly on
the face of the appeal bond itself that the same was received by the trial
court on <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further aggravated his lack of candor and
honesty in his dealing with the court by making it appear at the left-hand
bottom corner of his motion for approval of the record on appeal, appeal bond
dated March 8, 1968, that he attached therewith an appeal bond and notice of
appeal, when he knew very well that on April 15, 1968 - the day he filed his
aforesaid motion - he had already filed the notice of appeal on April 4, 1968,
and that he had not as yet filed an appeal bond (p. 99, in relation to pp. 94 &amp;
236, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Censurable is the kind of language used by counsel for petitioner
in many of his pleadings of record in referring to the trial court, the adverse
counsel and the court commissioner, for which he is hereby admonished not to
employ offensive language henceforth.</p>

<p class="BODY">The language vehicle does not run short of expressions, emphatic
but respectful, convincing but not derogatory, illuminating but not offensive (<span class="SpellE">Rheem</span> of the Phil. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-22979, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 26, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
