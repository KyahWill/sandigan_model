				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is &nbsp;an original petition for mandamus filed by Roberto V. Merrera to compel the Secretary of Justice and the Financial &nbsp;Officer of the Department of Justice to pay him his salary as acting Justice of the Peace of Binmaley, Pangasinan, for the period of from December 27, 1961 to February &nbsp;19, &nbsp;1902 and from May &nbsp;16, 1962 to July 31, 1962, and &nbsp;for &nbsp;such period thereafter that he &nbsp;is actually discharging the functions of said office. &nbsp;The facts of the case are not disputed, thus: <blockquote> <p>August 21, 1961—Judge Raymundo V. Vinluan, incumbent Justice of the Peace of Binmaley, &nbsp;Pangasinan, took an &nbsp;indefinite leave &nbsp;of absence &nbsp;on the &nbsp;ground of &nbsp;illness.</p> <p>September 7, &nbsp;1961—Petitioner Roberto &nbsp;V. Merrera applied for the position &nbsp;of Auxiliary Justice of the Peace of Binmaley, Pangasinan &nbsp;(which was &nbsp;then vacant).</p> <p>September 8, &nbsp;1961—The &nbsp; Secretary of Justice recommended the appointment &nbsp;of &nbsp;petitioner as &nbsp;Auxiliary Justice of the Peace &nbsp;of Binmaley, stating in his letter to the President that "the immediate filling of the position &nbsp;is necessary in the interest of public service". September 11, 1961—The Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance &nbsp;of &nbsp;Pangasinan -wrote the Secretary of &nbsp; Justice, urging the immediate appointment of an Auxiliary Justice of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Peace for Binmaley, in the interest &nbsp;of the efficient &nbsp;administration &nbsp;of justice, stating that there were many cases pending in that municipality that required &nbsp;attention.</p> <p>November 6,1961—Petitioner was extended an a<i>d interim</i> appointment as Auxiliary Justice of the Peace of Binmaley, Pangasinan. </p> <p>December &nbsp;20, 1961—The appointment was released &nbsp;to the appointee.</p> <p>December 26, 1961—Petitioner's <i>ad-interim</i> &nbsp;appointment, together with 2 &nbsp;other appointments, was forwarded to &nbsp;the &nbsp;Commission&nbsp; on Appointments for confirmation. </p> <p>December 27, 1961—Petitioner took his oath of office as <i>ad-interim</i> Auxiliary Justice of the Peace and immediately entered upon the discharge of his functions as acting Justice &nbsp;of the Peace of Binmaley, &nbsp;in place of the absent incumbent.</p> <p> January 18, 1962—The Executive Judge of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of First Instance of Pangasinan designated &nbsp;petitioner to act as Justice of the Peace of Lingayen, Pangasinan during the absence of the &nbsp;incumbent thereof, &nbsp;effective &nbsp;January &nbsp;19, 20 &nbsp;and &nbsp;22, there being no &nbsp;auxiliary justice &nbsp;of the peace in &nbsp;said municipality. Pursuant to this &nbsp; designation, he held office in those 3 days in Lingayen. &nbsp;</p> <p>January 29, &nbsp;1962— Petitioner was &nbsp;informed by &nbsp;the Executive, Judge of Pangasinan of the &nbsp;receipt of a telegram from the Secretary of Justice directing that petitioner be &nbsp;advised not to assume, office in view &nbsp;of &nbsp;the President's &nbsp;Administrative Order No. 2 and the decision &nbsp; of the Supreme &nbsp;Court &nbsp;in the Aytona-Castillo &nbsp;case. January &nbsp;31, &nbsp;1962—Petitioner &nbsp;answered &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;Executive Judge stating in his &nbsp; letter (Annex &nbsp;A to Petitioner's &nbsp;memorandum), that his case &nbsp;is &nbsp;not &nbsp;covered by &nbsp;the Administrative Order No. 2. of the President nor does it come within the doctrine of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Aytona case, &nbsp;his &nbsp;appointment not being a &nbsp;"midnight appointment" within the spirit &nbsp;and rationale of said case. &nbsp;In the &nbsp;same letter, &nbsp;he also prayed that the &nbsp;Secretary of Justice &nbsp;allow him &nbsp;to &nbsp;continue &nbsp;in office &nbsp;and to order the payment of &nbsp;his &nbsp;salary &nbsp;for services &nbsp;already rendered. </p> <p>February 19, 1962—The Executive Judge, &nbsp;by a 3rd Indorsement on &nbsp;a &nbsp; communication from the Department &nbsp;of Justice; gave &nbsp;petitioner 24 hours to &nbsp;cease acting &nbsp;as auxiliary justice of the peace.</p> <p>February &nbsp;20, &nbsp;1962—Petitioner desisted &nbsp;from holding office &nbsp;as Justice of the Peace of Binmaley.</p> <p>February &nbsp;26, 1962—Petitioner &nbsp;wrote a letter to the Executive Judge &nbsp;giving the reasons &nbsp;and the nature &nbsp;of his &nbsp;cessation from discharging the functions of &nbsp;the &nbsp;office, &nbsp;stating that he did so not&nbsp; because he was waiving his right but only as a gesture of respect to &nbsp;the &nbsp;authorities, expressing the hope that further developments may establish &nbsp;the legality and validity of his &nbsp;said &nbsp;appointment. </p> <p>April 27, 1962—Petitioner's <i>ad-interim</i> appointment as Auxiliary Justice of the Peace of Binmaley, Pangasinan, was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments.</p> <p>May &nbsp;16, 1962—Petitioner again took possession of the office and discharged the functions thereof.</p> <p>June 29, 1962—The &nbsp;Secretary of Justice again advised petitioner to refrain from &nbsp;holding office.</p> <p>June 30, 1962— Petitioner &nbsp;informed the Executive &nbsp;Judge &nbsp;that for the reasons &nbsp;stated in his letter, &nbsp;he &nbsp;regretted that &nbsp;he could not desist from &nbsp;performing the &nbsp;duties of &nbsp;his office and reiterated his request that &nbsp;his salary for services already rendered be paid. </p> <p>August &nbsp;15, 1962—Petitioner stopped holding office as &nbsp;Acting Justice of the &nbsp;Peace &nbsp;of &nbsp;Binmaley &nbsp;in view &nbsp;of the return from leave of absence of its incumbent Judge Raymundo Vinluan. </p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly, we are here only called upon to determine whether or &nbsp;not under &nbsp;the &nbsp;aforestated facts, the ruling &nbsp;laid down &nbsp;in the &nbsp;<i>Aytona</i> case &nbsp;may be &nbsp;invoked and &nbsp;applied in &nbsp;the present controversy.</p> <p>Note that in declining to disregard the President's &nbsp;Administrative Order &nbsp;No. 2 in the &nbsp;<i>Aytona</i> &nbsp;case, this &nbsp;Court considered the circumstances surrounding the issuance of 350 appointments, &nbsp;of &nbsp;which therein petitioner Aytona's was one, in the &nbsp;night of December 29, 1961, such as the "scramble" &nbsp;in Malacañang &nbsp;of candidates &nbsp;for positions trying to get their written appointments or having such appointments changed to more convenient places; the fact that such mass &nbsp;appointments were &nbsp;issued &nbsp;a &nbsp;few &nbsp;hours before &nbsp;the &nbsp;inauguration of the new &nbsp;President. &nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, after observing &nbsp;that the appointing President &nbsp;could &nbsp;not have &nbsp;exercised &nbsp; the care necessary &nbsp;to insure &nbsp;that said appointments &nbsp;would be approved by &nbsp;"a Commission on Appointments &nbsp;different from that existing at the &nbsp;time of the &nbsp; appointments", &nbsp;this &nbsp;Court &nbsp;declared &nbsp;that &nbsp;such &nbsp;act lends &nbsp;"force to &nbsp;the contention that those appointments fall beyond the &nbsp;intent and spirit &nbsp;of the &nbsp;constitutional provision granting &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;Executive &nbsp;authority to issue <i> ad interim</i> appointments". &nbsp;Such &nbsp;circumstances &nbsp;were therein found to &nbsp;fit &nbsp;the &nbsp;"exceptional circumstances justifying revocation" &nbsp;of said &nbsp;appointments. &nbsp;But this &nbsp;Court, realizing the &nbsp;danger &nbsp;&nbsp;of &nbsp;over-stretching the &nbsp; effect &nbsp;of that decision beyond the extreme and extraordinary &nbsp;circumstances particularly attending the case, wisely stated that:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The filling up of vacancies in important positions &nbsp;if few, and so spaced as to afford some assurance of deliberate action &nbsp;and careful consideration &nbsp;of &nbsp;the need for the appointment and the appointee's qualifications &nbsp;may undoubtedly be permitted". &nbsp;(Italic supplied.)</p> </blockquote> <p>The present case comes squarely within this qualification of the Aytona &nbsp;ruling. &nbsp;&nbsp;That there was need for filling the vacancy is attested by the communication of the Executive Judge of the Court of &nbsp;First Instance of Pangasinan. That the &nbsp;herein petitioner &nbsp;was &nbsp;qualified &nbsp;for the position is shown by &nbsp;the &nbsp;favorable recommendation of the Secretary of Justice &nbsp;as early as &nbsp;September 8, 1961. &nbsp;&nbsp;That there &nbsp;was deliberate &nbsp;action &nbsp;and &nbsp;careful consideration on the part of &nbsp;the appointing power is borne by the fact that the appointment was extended &nbsp;on November &nbsp;6, &nbsp;1961,—even before the election day. &nbsp;All these and the fact that petitioner qualified and entered &nbsp;upon the &nbsp;discharge of his official &nbsp;functions days before the "scramble" &nbsp;in Malacañang, &nbsp;argue that petitioner's appointment does &nbsp;not &nbsp;fall within the ruling of the Aytona case.</p> <p>Neither can it be &nbsp;seriously contended &nbsp;that petitioner abandoned the office when he vacated the same on August 15, 1962, or that he is guilty of laches &nbsp;for failing to file the &nbsp;appropriate action after he &nbsp;was required to &nbsp;desist from discharging the &nbsp; functions of the office in January, 1962. &nbsp;As may be seen from the recital of facts, petitioner consistently insisted on his &nbsp;right to &nbsp;the &nbsp;office, claiming and rightly so, that he does not fall within the coverage of the cited ruling &nbsp;of &nbsp;this Court. &nbsp;And through all these exchanges of communications, petitioner kept on praying for the payment of his salary, which is the object of this petition. &nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, his &nbsp;desistance &nbsp;to &nbsp;hold &nbsp; office from February &nbsp;20 to May &nbsp;15, &nbsp;"in a &nbsp;gesture &nbsp;of respect &nbsp;to the authorities" and &nbsp;in obedience to the order &nbsp;of the &nbsp;Secretary of Justice, can not be held against the petitioner as constituting &nbsp;laches. &nbsp;On &nbsp;the contrary, it evinces the character of the &nbsp;petitioner &nbsp;as a man of law. Such &nbsp;an attitude is indeed worthy of &nbsp;praise and not condemnation. However, when his appointment was confirmed, he again resumed the discharge of his duties until on August 15, he had to cease acting as justice of the peace &nbsp;by reason of the return of the &nbsp;incumbent.</p> <p>In view op &nbsp;the foregoing considerations, petitioner is declared &nbsp;entitled to the &nbsp; position of Auxiliary &nbsp;Justice of the Peace of Binmaley, Pangasinan and the corresponding &nbsp; emoluments attached thereto, &nbsp;and respondents &nbsp;are hereby directed to pay petitioner's &nbsp; salary for the period that he &nbsp;actually &nbsp;discharged the functions &nbsp;of &nbsp;his office. Without &nbsp;costs. &nbsp;So ordered.</p> <p><i>Labrador, &nbsp;Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., &nbsp;Paredes, &nbsp;Dizon, Regala, </i>and <i> Makalintal, JJ.,</i> &nbsp;concur;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PADILLA, J.:</b></p> <p>I dissent &nbsp;for the same reason stated in my opinion in the case of Aytona <i>vs.</i> &nbsp; Castillo, G.R. No. L-19313, promulgated on 19 January 1962. &nbsp;However, the &nbsp;petitioner is entitled to his salary as acting Justice of the &nbsp;Peace of Binmaley, Pangasinan, from 27 to 29 &nbsp;December 1961.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</b></p> <p>I dissent as per my opinion in the Aytona Case.</p> <p>Petition granted.</p> </div>
