VS. THE HON. ANGEL MOJICA AND LIWAYWAY GAWGAW AND COFFEE REPACKING, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Judge, as perhaps could have been expected, as­sumed
jurisdiction in the light of a complaint for damages with writ for preliminary
injunction, dated July 12, 1965, that on its face betrayed no indication of its
fatal infirmity, the matter in dispute turning out to be an unfair labor
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was more, the plea of the
other respondent, <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span> <span class="SpellE">Gawgaw</span>
&amp; Coffee Repacking, for a preliminary injunction was granted by it on July
16, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Federacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Obrera</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Industria</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabaquera</span>, defendant below, invited respondent Judge's
attention in its motion to dismiss complaint and to quash and dissolve the
above writ, dated July 19, 1965, and in its answer to the above complaint, like­wise
of the same date, to the existence "of two unfair labor practice
cases" pending before the Court of Industrial Relations, but without
success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it would appear from the
order of August 28, 1965 of respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Considering the
'Motion to Dismiss Complaint and to Quash and Dissolve Writ of Restraining
Order’ dated July 19, 1965, filed by counsel for the defendants and the
opposition thereto, and it appearing from the averments of the complaint that
this court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case said motion to
dismiss <span style="">is </span>hereby denied and so
with the prayer to dissolve the Writ <span style="">of
</span>restraining order, for lack of merit.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition for certiorari and prohibition with preli­minary
injunction, dated September 14, 1965, complaining against the respondent Judge
acting without or in excess of jurisdiction or the very least, with grave abuse
of discretion in taking cognizance of the aforesaid complaint, issuing the writ
of<span style=""> </span>preliminary in­junction of
July 16, 1965, and the order of August 28, 1965 denying the motion to dismiss and
to dissolve such writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has
the right to the writs prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">While, as above noted, the complaint for damages with preli­minary
injunction would suffice for respondent Judge acting on the matter, especially
in view of the explicit allegation by respondent <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gawgaw</span> &amp; Coffee Repacking, as plaintiff, that
there were no pending unfair labor practice cases before the Court of
Industrial Relations, still the pleadings thereafter filed by <span style="">now </span>petitioner as defendant to dismiss
the complaint and to dissolve the preliminary injunction <span style="">as well as </span>its answer ought to have put
respondent Judge into a frame of mind, at the very least skeptical of the
correctness of the action taken by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A brief inquiry as to the real facts of the matter would have revealed
that a complaint of the other respondent was so artfully worded as to lend a
semblance of plausibility to a jurisdiction that does not in fact <span style="">exist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If such a procedure were followed, respondent Judge could have
properly disposed of the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would have dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction and dismissed the
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">has been </span>the
constant and uninterrupted holding of this Court from PAFLU v. Tan<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>to Philippine Communications
Electronics &amp; Electricity Workers' Federation v. <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that under the Industrial Peace Act, unfair labor practice cases fall within
the exclusive competence of the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">a
</span>respondent Judge did paid scant heed to such an unbroken line of
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot elicit our approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Reyes v. Tan,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
decided the same day as the above case of PAFLU v. Tan, it was stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There are, however, admissions in this
case by both parties that the acts against which the in­junction in question
was obtained constitute unfair labor practices * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we are to go by these admissions, then the
application for injunction would have been exclusively cognizable by the Court
of Industrial Relations and beyond the jurisdiction of the respondent Court of
First Instance." Here, in the opposition to motion to dis­miss complaint
and to quash the restraining order, respondent <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gawgaw</span> &amp; Coffee Repacking stated as "the
truth of the matter" the fact "that alleged Cases Nos. 502-ULP and
3972-ULP mentioned by the defendants in their present motion to dismiss are
not, strictly and legally speaking, actual cases pending before the Court of
Industrial Relations, but <span style="">mere </span>'charges'
or complaints which are purely speculative in nature and as such are merely
pend­ing preliminary investigation by the CIR-Prosecutors of the Court of
Industrial Relations and not before the Court itself."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the above admission is fatal to the assumption of
jurisdiction by respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
early as Erlanger <span style="">&amp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>, Inc. v. Erlanger &amp; <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>
Employees <span style="">Association,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>it has been the <span style="">principle adopted </span>by this Court that
even "if no unfair labor practice suit has been filed at all by any of the
parties in the Court of Industrial Relations" at the time an injunction
was filed in the <span style="">court of first
instance, </span>still the <span style="">latter
"would have no jurisdiction </span>to issue the temporary restraining
order prayed for if it is <span style="">shown </span>to
its satisfaction that the labor dispute arose out of unfair labor practices
committed by any of the parties." It is still the Court of Industrial
Relations where <span style="">the action </span>must
be filed and where a restraining order could issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="">was </span>an
emphatic reaffirmation of this doctrine in an even later case, the aforecited
Philippine Communications, Elec­tronics &amp; Electricity Workers' Association
v. <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, decided barely a month ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> jurisdiction stays even if no
unfair labor practice case has been filed with CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that unfair labor practice is
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This renders irrelevant the
distinction respondents would wish to make between an unfair labor practice <u>charge</u>
and an unfair labor practice <u>complaint</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no other conclusion in the light of the repeated
pronouncements by this Tribunal except the rather obvious fact that respondent
Judge assumed jurisdiction over a matter which by law is vested in the Court of
Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its actuation,
therefore, could be successfully impugned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This petition must be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, let a writ of certiorari issue to annul the
order of July 16, 1965 of respondent Judge for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction as well as the order of respondent Judge of August 28,
1965, denying petitioner's motion to dismiss the com­plaint in Civil Case No.
2631-P of the Seventh Judicial District, Branch VII, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City as well as to quash the writ of preliminary injunction and respondent
Judge, or his successor acting in his place and stead, is hereby ordered to
desist from taking any further action or any further step in Civil Case No.
2631-P, the matter therein involved being outside his jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against respon­dent <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span>
