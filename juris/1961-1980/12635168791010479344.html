				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Defendants <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>, seek the reversal of a decision of the Court of
First Instance of Laguna insofar as it convicts them of the crimes of murder
and frustrated murder and sentences them, for the first, to life imprisonment,
with the corresponding accessory penalties, to jointly and severally indemnify
the heirs of the deceased, Montano <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>, in
the sum of P6,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in the event of insolvency,
and to pay one-third (1/3) of the costs, and, for the second, to an
indeterminate penalty ranging from ten (10) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> to fourteen (14) years, eight
(8) months and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, with the
corresponding acces­sory penalties, and to pay one-third (1/3) of the
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same decision acquitted
appellants of the crime of frustrated murder as regards the person of <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>, with the
corresponding part of the costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
and provided that the service of the penalties imposed for the first two (2)
offenses shall not exceed 40 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 18, 1963, between 9 and 9:45 p.m., <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>, Montano <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>
and Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> were in the latter's house, in the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahabang-Pulo</span>, Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Majada</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>,
Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were seated on the floor of
the "balcony" or extension of the kitchen, which had a brightly
lighted kerosene lamp on a table, and was about four (4) feet from the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were drinking coffee in that
place, four or five men approached that part of said extension which had no
siding, where the bamboo stairs were.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> recognized among them his
neighbors, appellants <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span> and Bruno <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invited
them to partake of the coffee as well as inquired where they were going, but
they replied with a burst of gunshots, and then began to run away, although
they kept on shooting as they did so.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>,
a brother of Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>, was then in his (<span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>' s) house, about 20 meters away from that of
Felix, listening to a radio program.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon hearing the first shots, coming from the direction of the latter’s
house, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> hurriedly descended his kitchen
stairs and, lying down on the ground, watched five (5) men pass by - at about
one-arm length (2 yards) from him, firing their guns as they fled - among whom
he recognized appellants <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few minutes later, members of the constabulary arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found Montano <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>
mortally wounded and Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> injured seriously
in the neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together with <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>, who sustained
no injury by dropping to the floor, they immediately brought Montano <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span> and Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> to
the hospital of the <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> Sugar Estate, where Montano
died about 30 minutes later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
the constabulary agents, accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>, returned to the scene of the occurrence, and
inquired about the details thereof from, among others, <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The formal
investigation seemingly began the next day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> was hospitalized for over a
month, although medical treatment continued thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, on January 6 and March 11, 1965, or
about two (2) years after the occurrence, he gave his testimony in Court lying
down on a stretcher, because he had not, as yet, fully recovered from his
aforementioned injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon after the occurrence, a complaint charging appellants <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>, as well as
Bruno <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>, with murder and frustrated murder, was
filed with the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>,
who, after conducting a preliminary investigation, found the existence of
probable cause and forwarded the records to the Court of First Instance of
Laguna, where the corresponding information was thereafter filed against said
four (4) defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial,
with respect only to appellants herein, for Bruno <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>
has not been apprehended as yet, said Court rendered the decision adverted to
above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal, upon the
ground that the lower court had erred:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) in finding appellants guilty of having murdered Montano <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>, with the qualifying circumstance of treachery;
(2) in convicting appellants of frustrated murder as regards Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>; and (3) in not acquitting said appellants of both
charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, appellants assail the sufficiency of the
evidence for the prosecution identifying them among the culprits, and
establishing treachery, apart from evident premeditation, on their part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the identity of the culprits,
Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span> testified positively that they recognized
appellants <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span> among the
persons who fired at them in the evening of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>
recognized a fourth man, Bruno <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span>, who, the for­mer
noticed, carried also a "long gun".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their testimony was substantially corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>, who identified appellants <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> among the five (5)
armed men he saw at the scene of the occurrence, while they were hurriedly
leaving the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The veracity of these witnesses for the prosecution is beyond
doubt, for they had no possible reason to falsely incriminate appellants herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the former could not have mistaken the latter for other persons,
because they were not only acquaintances of long standing, but, also, barrio
mates.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, the place where Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> and his guests
were taking coffee was brightly lighted with a kerosene lamp; the evening was
clear; an almost "round" moon was shining; their assailants were only
from one <span style="">(1) </span>to four (4) <span style="">arms </span>length from them, when the former
began shooting, and one-arm-length from <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>, when they beat a hasty retreat; the faces of said
assailants were not covered; and, although they wore hats, the brims thereof
did not hide their faces, apart from the fact that the extension of the kitchen
of Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> stood on a depression of the soil,
so that the culprits must have been on a ground higher than the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the conditions were favorable
to the recognition of the culprits or, at least, of some of them, by the
witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
their testimony is plain, simple and straightforward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears all the earmarks of being frank,
candid and honest.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>
is illiterate, whereas <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>
has hardly completed the first grade in school and Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>
has barely reached the second grade.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the defense has merely set up an <u>alibi</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have us believe that, in the evening
of <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1963</st1:date>, appellants
were in the house of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>,
president of the Laguna chapter of the Federation of Free Farmers, in the
barrio of <span class="SpellE">Mamati<span style="">d</span></span><span style="">, </span><st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Alibi</u> is, however, the weakest of all
defenses<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and it is well-settled that it can not prevail over direct positive evidence on
the presence of the accused at the scene of the occurrence.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This is especially true in the case at bar, for appellants admit that they know
of no possible motive for the witnesses for the prosecution to perjure against
them (appellants) and, imme­diately after the occurrence, <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">De­cillo</span> revealed to the authorities appellants'
participation in the commission of the crimes involved in this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Certainly, appellants' testimony regarding their alleged conference with <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> can not be taken
on its face value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> appears to have testified, also, in support of
the alibi set up by the defendant in another criminal case involving a member
of the Federation of Free Farmers in Laguna, to which appellants are, likewise,
affiliated, he being the president of the Laguna chapter of said Federation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
seems to be a professional witness for "Free Farmers" who are accused
of crimes and have no other defense than an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagaspas</span>, who similarly tried to corroborate
appellants' alibi, merits no greater weight, he being the vice-president of
said chapter of the Federation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to note, also, that <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>
is barely 30 minutes away, by jeep, from <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>;
that the precise time at which appellants were allegedly in <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>
on April 18, 1963, has not been positively established, for <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> said that he and the other appellants arrived
at that place “more or less past 8:00 o'clock <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>in the evening", whereas <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> affirmed that
they were there since 6:00 p.m., and, although <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> declared that appellants were in <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span> up to 10:30 p.m., <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> said that they <u>left</u> the place at <u>10:00</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>p.m. and <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ma­baga</span> testified that they <u>arrived</u> at <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> at about 10:00 p.m., so that they must have left <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span> - assuming hypothetically that they had really been
there - at around 9:30 p.m., or a little before; and that, according to <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>, the shooting
happened at about 9:45 p.m., which is the very information given by the Constabulary
investigators to a laboratory technician who conducted paraffin tests for the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the witnesses for the
defense merely made an estimate of the time alluded to in their testimony and
it is not certain that appellants could not have been in <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>
at the time of the occurrence, after their alleged conference with <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> in <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the evidence for the defense has corroborated,
in one important respect, that of the prosecution, and that is that appellants
were together at the time of the occurrence, thus bolstering up the
prosecution.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
At that time, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>
said, evidently in an unguarded moment, he was <u><span style="">in his house in <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span></span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On
direct examination by counsel for the defense, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
testified:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. DIMAANO</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can you explain to the Honorable Court why
the witnesses for the prosecution pointed to you as the assailant?</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not really know about that, sir, I was
surprised why I was pointed to as the assailant, sir.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Witness for the prosecution testified before
this Honorable Court that he was drinking coffee together with two others and
that this happened on the night of Apr. 18, 1963, and said that you were about
4 to 5 meters from him when you fired your carbine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What can you say as to that testimony?</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those are lies because <u><span style="">I was in our house</span></u><span style="">, </span>how could it be possible that I was
the one who fired at them?"</p>

<p class="BODY">Since <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> was then with his
co-appellants and his house is in <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span>, it
follows that <u>all of </u><u><span style="">them were
in that municipality</span></u><span style="">, </span>not
in <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>, when the attack upon Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> and his guests took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, a motive has been duly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>
testified that, about two (2) weeks prior to the occurrence, appellants herein
and Bruno <span class="SpellE">Cabillo</span> had urged him to join them in a petition
for the expropriation of the lands of the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>
Sugar Estate, parts of which were held by them, and that he (Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>) turned down their request, despite their warning
that "something wrong" would happen to him if he did not acquiesce
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense attaches much weight to the negative result of
paraffin tests conducted on <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> and other members of their family, and to the fact
that the striations on some .30 caliber discharged cartridges picked up at the scene
of the occurrence were not congruent with those of similar cartridges fired
from a carbine found in the house of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> the next day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Commenting on the paraffin tests, His Honor, the trial Judge said:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It will
be noted that the test was made about 13 hours after the commission of the
crime and there is enough opportunity for the accused to have employed means
and methods to have caused the disappearance of gunpowder residue, not counting
that the use of gloves or other devises could have easily foiled such chemical
test."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the carbine subjected to ballistic test, the decision
appealed from contains the following observation:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
could well be that this firearm was not the firearm used in the commission of
the crime otherwise the accused <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span> would not have been as careless or stupid enough to
keep it in his house and in a place easily to be discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the said carbine according to <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabaga</span>, has a permit from
Governor <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> and as this gun could easily be
traced, this firearm was not one of those used in the commission of these
crimes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, and considering that the veracity of the
witnesses for the prosecution is incontestable; that they could not have
possibly committed a mistake in identifying appellants herein among the
culprits; that appellants were, admittedly, together in the evening of the
occurrence; that immediately after the occurrence said witnesses for the
prosecution informed the Constabulary of defendants' participation in the
commission of the crimes charged; that, soon thereafter, before the evening was
over, the authorities began to look for the defendants, and some of them were,
in fact, apprehended that same evening; and that the defendants had a motive to
attempt against the life of Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>, it is
clear that His Honor, the trial Judge, has not overlook or misconstrued any
circumstance of weight and importance in the determination of the credibility
and weight of the testimonial evidence on record, and that, accordingly, we are
not justified in disturbing his findings of fact, based upon the veracity of
the witnesses for the prosecution, whose behavior he had an opportunity, denied
to us, to observe.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the victims were shot while they were drinking
coffee, immediately after one of them had invited appellants to partake of this
beverage, it follows that the latter had acted with treachery, their attack
having taken place suddenly, under conditions eliminating any possibility of
defense on the part of their victims.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, the fact that appellants went together, provided with firearms, to
the scene of the occurrence and that, upon reaching the same and, without any
provocation from their victims, they (appellants) simultaneously fired at them,
coupled with the threats made to Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span> two
(2) weeks before, establish the existence of conspiracy among appellants, as
well as evident premeditation on their part.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The crimes committed were, therefore, murder and frustrated murder, qualified
by treachery, with the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, apart
from that of dwelling, as regards the frustrated murder against Felix <span class="SpellE">Decillo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Owing to the evident premeditation attending the commission of
both offenses, the penalty prescribed by law for the crime of murder must be
imposed in its maximum period, which is death, and the decision appealed from
should be modified accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The retribution
therein meted out for the frustrated murder is, however, within the statutory
range.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, modified as to the penalty for murder, which is
raised to the extreme penalty, and as to the indemnity to the heirs of Montano <span class="SpellE">Matanguihan</span>, which is hereby increased to P12,000,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the decision appealed from is, therefore, affirmed, in all other respects, with
costs against the defendants-appellants.</p>
