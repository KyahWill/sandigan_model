without examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jose Ma. Torres - hereinafter referred to as respondent - is a Spanish

otherwise known as the <span class="SpellE">Claretian</span> Missionaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having graduated from the University of
Barcelona, Spain, with the degree of Licentiate Medicine and Surgery, he is

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1955</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner herein,
Philippine Medical Association, is a do­mestic corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="6"><span style="">June 14, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, it addressed the Chairman of the Board a
communication requesting reconsideration of said resolution No. 25, upon the
ground that, pursuant to said Medical Act of 1959, respondent has to take and
pass the examination there­in prescribed, before he can be allowed to practice
medicine in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
letter was followed by another, dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="10"><span style="">October 6, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, to which said Chairman replied on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="10"><span style="">October
 8, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, stating
"that the final decision on the matter will have to come from the
President of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> upon whose authority said resolution has
been finally approved and implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereupon, or, on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="10"><span style="">October
 18, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner
commenced the present action, for the purpose stated at the beginning of this
decision, upon the theory that the Board had violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 2382 in granting
respondent's certificate for the general practice of medicine in the
Philippines without the examination pres­cribed in said Act; that the Board had
exceeded its authority in </span>passing <span style="">said
Resolution, because, of which</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the same is null and void; that the Board
should therefore, be ordered to cancel the certificate issued in pursuance of
said resolution; and that peti­tioner has no other plain, adequate and speedy
remedy in the ordi­nary course of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their respective
answers, respondents, admit the basic facts, but not the conclusions drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by the petitioner and allege that the resolution
in question is sanctioned by the provisions of the Treaty above referred to;
that petitioner has no cause of ac­tion; and that the petition should be
dismissed for failure of the pe­titioner to exhaust the available
administrative </span><span style="">remedies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents cite the
cases of <span class="SpellE">Costas</span> vs. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aldanese</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Almario</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">v</span><span style="">s. City Mayo</span><span style="">r</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in support of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">theory that
petitioner herein has no sufficient interest or "personality" to
maintain the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
case, it was held that the president </span>of <span style="">the Association of Philippine (Marine) Engineers</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> had no particular "individual"
interest, and, hence, no </span><span style="">c</span>ause <span style="">of
action for <u>mandamus</u> to compel the Collector of Customs to implement </span>Section
<span style="">1203(j) of the Administrative Code,
providing that s</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">eamers making round trips of more than 48
hours or <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> at night shall carry the comple­ment
of marine engineers therein specified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the second case, a citizen </span>of <span style="">the Philippines, as such, who is not an applicant for any stall or
booth, or the </span><span style="">representative </span><span style="">of any such applicant, stall-holder or <u>any</u>
<u>association</u> <u>of</u> <u>persons</u> who are deprived of the right to
occupy stalls in said market, "is not the real party in interest who has
the capacity, right or personality" to bring an action for <u>mandamus</u>,
to compel the officers of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pasay</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">City
to comply with the provis</span>ions of <span style="">Republic
Act No. 37, by ejecting, from the public market of </span>said City,
stallholders who are nationals of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said cases are not in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, both are actions <u>mandamus</u>, whereas the case at bar
is mainly one for <u>certiorari</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although, petitioner herein, likewise, seeks a writ of mandamus,
directing the Board to cancel the certificate of registration issued the
respondent, this would be a <u>necessary consequence</u> of the writ of
certiorari annulling the disputed resolution. Moreover, said two cases were
commenced <span style="">by </span><u>individuals who,
as such, had no special interest in the relief therein prayed for</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in the <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>
case it <span style="">was </span>intimated
that the result might have been other­wise had it been brought by an
"association" whose members have an interest in the subject-matter of
the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was confirmed by PHILCONSA vs. Gimenez,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> in which
we<span style=""> sustained </span>the right of the
Philippine Constitution Association to <span style="">as</span>sail the constitutionality of Republic Act
No. 3836, insofar as it allowed retirement gratuity and commutation of vacation
and sick <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ieave</span></span><span style=""> </span>to members of Congress and to
elective officials thereof. Further authority in favor of petitioner herein is
supplied by <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party vs. F. Bautista Angelo<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> in which the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party successfully impugned the validity of the designation of the then
Solicitor General as Acting Member of the Commission on Elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our considered opinion that the view adopted in the last
three (3) cases should be maintained and that, in line therewith, petitioner
herein has sufficient interest to prosecute the case at bar<span style=""> </span>and a cause of action against
respondents herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards their objection based upon petitioner's failure to
appeal to the President, suffice <span style="">it to </span>say
that the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies <span style="">is </span>concededly subject to exceptions,
among which are cases involving only questions of law or when juris­diction is
in issue<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a><span style=""> or </span>the action complained of bears the
approval of a department secretary, as the disputed resolution, which was
approved by the Executive Secretary “by authority of the President or as an <u>alter</u>
<u>ego</u> of the Executive.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> The case
at bar falls under these exceptions to said rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue herein hinges on the interpretation of Article I
of the Treaty aforementioned, reading as follows.</p>

<blockquote>"The nationals of both countries who shall have obtained
degrees or diplomas to practice the liberal professions in either of the
Contracting States, issued by competent national authorities, shall be deemed
competent to exercise said professions in the territory of the other, <u>subject</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>laws</u> <u>and</u> <u>regulations</u> <u>of the latter</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the degree or diploma of Bachelor,
issued by competent national authorities allows its holder without requiring
further evidence of proficiency to pursue normally higher courses of study, he
shall also be deemed qualified to continue his studies in the territory of
either Party in conformity with the applicable laws and regulations of the
State which recognizes the validity of the title or diploma in question, and
with the rules and regulations of the particular educational institution in
which he intends to pursue his studies.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Treaty provision was the subject matter of our resolution of
August 15, 1961, in connection with the petition of Arturo <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
Garcia for admission to the Philippine Bar without taking the Bar
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After completing, in Spain,
the course pres­cribed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, Garcia had been
graduated from the College of Law of the Universidad Central de Madrid with the
degree of "<span class="SpellE">Licenciado</span> en <span class="SpellE">Derecho</span>",
which entitled him to practice law in Spain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having invoked the provisions of said Treaty in support of his claim of
ex­emption from the requisite bar examinations, this Court denied his petition
upon the ground, among others " x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that the privileges provided in the Treaty invoked by the
applicant are made expressly subject to the laws and regulations of the
contracting State in whose territory it is desired to exercise the legal
profession; and Section 1 of Rule 127, in connection with Sections 2, 9, and 16
thereof, which have the force of law, require that before anyone can practice
the legal <span style="">profession in the Philippines
he must first successfully pass the required bar examinations; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find no
plausible reason to depart from this view.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, we reiterate the same, inasmuch as the theory of respon­dent
herein cannot be accepted without placing graduates from our own educational
institutions at a disadvantage <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> Spanish
graduates from Spanish schools, colleges or universities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the latter could - under respondent's
pretense - engage in the prac­tice of medicine in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
without taking the examination prescribed in Republic Act No. 2882, whereas the
former would have to take and pass said examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, since - as we ruled in the
Garcia case - the benefits of the aforementioned Treaty cannot be availed of in
the Philippines except by Spanish subjects, the result would be - should
respondent's contention be sustained - that graduates from Spanish schools of
medicine <u>would</u> <u>be</u> entitled to practice medi­cine in the
Philippines without examination, <u>if they were Spanish subjects</u> but <u>not</u>
if they are Filipinos.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Surely said Treaty was
not made to discriminate against Philippine schools, colleges or universities,
much less against nationals of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we hold that said Treaty merely extended to
diplomas issued or degrees conferred by educational institutions of Spain the
same recognition and treatment that we accord to simi­lar diplomas or degrees
from local institutions of learning; that holders of said Spanish diplomas or
degrees must take the examina­tion prescribed by our laws for holders of
similar diplomas or de­grees from educational institutions in the Philippines;
that resolution No. 25, series of 1965, of respondent Board <span style="">is </span><span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of Republic<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Act No. 2882 and hence, null
and void; and that, respondent Board of Medical Examiners should be, as it is hereby
ordered to cancel the certificate of registration, for the practice of medicine
in the Philippines, issued in favor of respondent Jose Ma. Torres, without
special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
