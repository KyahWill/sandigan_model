				<H3>DELFIN YAMBAO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ANGELINA GONZALES, ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action filed by Delfin Yambao against Angelina Gonzales and Maria 
Pablo praying that the latter be ordered to appoint and employ him as tenant 
during his lifetime on the parcels of land bequeathed to and inherited by them 
from Maria Gonzales, as well as to deliver to him the value of the harvests 
belonging to him as tenant of said parcels of land. In their answer, defendants 
averred that the provisions of' the will relied upon by plaintiff are not 
mandatory; that the determination of who should be the tenant of the land is 
vested in a special court; and that the present action is not the proper 
remedy.
<p>After trial, the court dismissed the complaint for lack of sufficient cause 
of action. It held that the provisions of the will relied upon by plaintiff 
merely amount to a suggestion to the defendants who, though morally bound, are 
not legally compelled to follow said suggestion, invoking as authority Article 
797 of the old Civil Code. Plaintiff has appealed.</p>
<p>The pertinent provisions of the will relied upon by appellant read as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dapat din naman malaman, ng dalawa kong taga-pagmana na sila MARIA PABLO at 
ANGELINA GONZALES na sila ay may dapat TUNGKULIN O GAMPANAN GAYA ng mga 
sumusunod:</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"(2) Pahihintulutan nila na si Delfin Yambao ang makapagtrabaho ng bukid 
habang panahon, at ang nasabing bukid ay isasailalim ng pamamahala ng Albasea 
samantalang ang bukid ay nasa usapin at may utang pa."</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears that on August 10, 1942, Maria Gonzales executed a will 
bequeathing to appellees all her properties situated in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. The 
will was probated in 1948. Immediately, thereafter, appellant went to appellees 
to request that he be placed as tenant of the riceland which, by an express 
provision of said will, they were directed to give to him for cultivation as 
tenant, and when they refused alleging that they had already given it to another 
tenant he filed the present action.</p>
<p>In holding that the provisions of the will relied upon by appellant imposes 
only a <em>moral</em> but not a <em>legal</em> obligation, the trial court went 
on to consider the import of the word "pahihintulutan" employed with reference 
to appellant. In its opinion said word only means <em>to permit</em> or <em>to 
allow</em>, but not to direct appellees to appoint appellant as tenant. Rather, 
it opines, it merely contains a suggestion to employ because the testatrix did 
not use the words "ipinag-uutos ko" which she used in connection with other 
provisions of the will, so that there is no clear indication that it was her 
intention to make such provision compulsory.</p>
<p>We believe, however, that the trial court has not properly interpreted the 
real import of the wish of the testatrix. Analyzing it carefully we will find 
that the same contains a clear directive to employ appellant as may be seen from 
the words preceding the word "pahihintulutan" which say: "Dapat din naman 
malaman, ng dalawa kong taga-pagmana na sila MARIA PABLO at ANGELINA GONZALES na 
sila ay may dapat TUNGKULIN O GAMPANAN GAYA ng mga sumusunod." The words "dapat 
TUNGKULIN O GAMPANAN" means <em>to do</em> or <em>to carry out</em> as a mandate 
or directive, and having reference to the word "pahihintulutan", can convey no 
other meaning than to impose a duty upon appellees. To follow the 
interpretations given by the trial court would be to devoid the wish of the 
testatrix of its real and true meaning.</p>
<p>Article 797 of the old Civil Code, invoked by the trial court, is 
inapplicable. That refers to an institution of an heir intended to be 
conditional by providing that a statement to that effect cannot be considered as 
a condition unless it appears clearly that such is the intention of the 
testator. We are not faced here with any conditional institution of heirship. 
What we have is a clear-cut mandate which the heirs cannot fail to carry 
out.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. Appellees are hereby 
ordered to employ appellant as tenant immediately after this decision has become 
final. Costs against appellees.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Paredes</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
