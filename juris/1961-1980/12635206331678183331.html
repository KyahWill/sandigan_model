BY THE PRES­IDENTIAL CERTIFICATION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, the background facts upon which the legal issues
in which parties joined in the lower court may be resolved are not stated in
the impugned orders, and it is precisely because of the failure of the
respondent court to make a finding on the principal factual is­sue raised by
private respondent that this case is hereby being ordered returned to
respondent court for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such failure, however, does not preclude this Court from passing now on
some of the questions raised in the pleadings on the basis of the other facts
in the record which are undisputed although they appear to have been merely
assumed in the orders under review, if only to guide the course of such further
proceedings.</p>

president, vice-pres­ident, secretary, treasurer, auditor and directors of
respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, on behalf of the said union, providing
as follows:</p>

mentioned shall report to the COMPANY not later than <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1965</st1:date> for advice as to when they can

that this Agreement has been duly ratified by its membership."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There seems to be no controversy as to
the fact that this above return-to-work provision was immediately duly
implemented by the Company as well as the members of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>,
other than those herein purportedly acting for the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>,
"200" in number, represented by Atty. Israel <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was at this juncture that the aforementioned presidential
certification was issued, and pursuant thereto the respondent court assumed
jurisdiction over this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a first step to take the case out of the indus­trial court,
petitioner requested the President in a letter dated <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1965</st1:date> to withdraw or recall the
certification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This request was endorsed
by the Executive Secretary to the Secretary of Labor and the latter, in a 2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1965</st1:date>, recommended to the President favorable action on petitioner's
request, but no action appears to have been taken by the President on this
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="12">December
 23, 1965</st1:date>, a new collective bargaining agreement was signed between
the same persons who signed the above-mentioned return-to­-work agreement of
October 14th, except that, on behalf <span style="">of
the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, a certain Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Espano</span>
signed additionally as Executive Vice-President and, on the other hand, none of
the directors were included, in this later agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In two successive motions, the first on October 30, 1965 and the
second on November 5, 1965, petitioner sought again to take the case out of the
court by asking <span style="">for either the
dismissal or suspension of the proceed­ings upon the grounds that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In connection with said motions, on
November 15, 1965, the same persons who signed the collective bargaining agreement
of December 23, 1965, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, filed over
their signatures a manifestation to the effect that "there exists no labor
dispute between the petitioner and the respondent company, that the strike
declared last May 16, 1965 has been officially terminated last October 14,
1965, and that petitioner has instructed its members to stop picketing."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the foregoing circumstances, the orders of denial of the
respondent court would indeed seem to be less than justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, albeit not in the said
orders nor in the answer but, <span style="">in </span>the
petition itself, (Par. 13, pp. 8-9) that a so-called "small group of
strikers --- being represented by Atty. Israel <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>",
evidently the one referred to in the questioned order of November 11, 1965 as
"200" others, (Exhibits "A" -"A-1", Strikers), [p<span style="">. </span>IV
Appendix A, Petitioner's Brief actually took part in the hearing of
petitioner's two motions for dismissal or suspension and thereat alleged that:</p>

<blockquote>"During the initial hearings, a certain group headed by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span> (who had even at the early stages of the strike,
crossed the picket lines) through counsel, made representations to this
Honorable Court that even before the issuance of the pres­idential
certification, there had been a 'return to work agreement' between them and the
respondent management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impli­cation
therefore is that they were not on strike at the time of the presidential
certification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously therefore they
have nothing to do with the strikers and the strike certified by the President.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This group during the hearings submit­ted to court the
purported 'agreement', a <span style="">document </span>showing
the list of their 'mem­bers' and a certification by the company that several of
these workers had returned to work.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"To this, the
petitioner union made the following manifestations and observations, among
others:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span> group is
a spurious group headed by 'strike-breakers';</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not recognize the agreement;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the hearing was for a possible return-to-work
order by the court, it was pre-mature to go into the merits as to the validity
of the claims of <span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span> who after all admits they
are not strike at all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With these observations, petitioner union reserved the
contesting of the claims of <span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span> however was
allowed to hand over the documents to the court, but without benefit of a <u>hearing
on the merits</u>. There could possibly be no judicial finding then as to the
existence of such a return-to-work agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may also be considered that if there was such a
return-to-work agreement then there was no strike at all that could be
certified to the court by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the respondent management raised this
contention on several occasions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"W<span style="">e</span> hasten to
add also that respondent management aside from claiming falsely that there is
no more strike has used this spur­ious agreement to sow confusion and demorali­zation
among the strikers by announcing that those who would not follow the return to
work provided in the agreement are subject to dismissal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was <span style="">on </span>the
backdrop of these circumstances that respondent court issued the first
challenged order which reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"This refers to respondent company's motion to suspend
proceedings filed with the Court on November 3, 1965, and to its motion to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction which it verbally interposed at the hear­ing
of the same date and formally filed on November 6, 1965, under the heading
'Motion <span style="">to </span>Dismiss and to
Suspend Proceed­ings.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In assailing the jurisdiction of the Court, respondent
questions the wisdom and propriety of the presidential certifi­cation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is no concern of the Court but
exclusively devolves upon the President (<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
Sugar Development Co. Inc. vs. CIR, et al., G.R. No. L-13178, <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1961</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of a labor dispute between the
parties is not disputed; hence, the Court should proceed to exercise
jurisdiction under Sec. 10, of R. A. 875.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Con­fronted with the same issue, this Court, in 'Central Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span> Workers Amalgamated - PAFLU vs. Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>
Sugar Central Company, Inc.,' Case No. 56-IPA, upheld jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason to deviate from that stand
and from the ruling of the Supreme Court.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The number of employees involved in a certified case, whether
great or small, is immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section
10 of Republic Act 875 merely requires that the labor dispute involve an
industry indispensable to the national interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The business of respon­dent company has been
found to be one such industry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is also argued that under the theory of exhaustion of
administrative remedies, the Court should suspend proceedings pend­ing action
on respondent's letter to the President for the recall of his certifica­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While respondent may avail itself of
administrative remedies, the Court, whose function to arbitrate without delay
is clear, may meantime legally proceed to exercise jurisdiction provided the
rights of the parties are not thereby prejudiced and vital industrial peace as
well as pre-conflict operation of the business concerned, restored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event the President recalls his
certification, the parties may revert to their positions prior thereto.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Anyway, </span>at
this stage, the Court is most concerned with the return to work of the
strikers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent has entered into a
return-to-work agreement with the Manila Cordage Workers Union - PAFLU, and has
admitted back to work the striking employees who were represented by the
signatories on behalf of the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
an agreement does not bar a presidential certification of the dispute inasmuch
as 'the relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are so impressed with public interest
that labor contracts must yield to the common good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
x' (Art. 1700, Civil Code.).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
virtue of said certifi­cation it will be discriminatory under the circumstances
for respondent not to readmit the other strikers not so represented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore no harm if a return to
work of the striking members is effected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court is aware of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of Cases Nos. 175-INJ and 4325-ULP, involving the same parties and, among
others, the issue of illegality of strike arising from the means employed
during the picketing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some strikers were
criminally charged for acts allegedly committed during the strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And were it not for the return-to-work agree­ment
earlier adverted to, the issue of ille­gality of the strike would take
preference over the reinstatement of the workers still on strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise the Court notes <span style="">that were it not </span>for the matter of the
reinstatement of the workers criminally charged, there would have been complete
accord between the parties as to the return to work of the other striking
workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, in order that
the issues raised in those two cases <span class="GramE">be</span> not prejudiced
by the exercise of jurisdic­tion in the instant case, the strikers who have
been charged with criminal offenses in the conduct of the strike should not, in
the meanwhile, return to work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From manifestations before the Court, there are only 33 of
these employees so charged criminally, as against 200 others, (Exhibits 'A' -
'A-1, Strikers) who will not stand to be benefited by a return to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records also show that respondent manage­ment,
if there would be a return to work at all, would be willing to reduce their
number.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent manifested however,
that because of the difficulty of determining the degree of culpability of
each, it may not be in a position to reduce their number meantime.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, upholding jurisdiction, the motion to dismiss
and/or suspend proceedings, is hereby DENIED.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the strikers represented by Atty. Israel <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span> are hereby directed to lift their picket lines and
re­turn to work forthwith, excepting the 33 strikers who have been charged
criminally and who should not return to work as yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respon<span style="">dent
is hereby directed to accept back to work the strikers whose names appear <span style="">in </span>the payroll of the company
immediately preced­ing the strike, excepting those criminally charged.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above-entitled case is hereby set for hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1965</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 P.M.</st1:time>, to find out whether management would
be able to reduce the number of those who would not return to work meantime.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On these premises, the main target of petitioner's attack is the
respondent court's refusal to declare it­self without jurisdiction to give due
course to the presidential certification above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's theory in support of this
posture is that the said cer­tification "appears to have been made on
(the) erroneous factual bases" of the existence of "a labor dispute
bet­ween the COMPANY and the UNION", "that the business of the
COMPANY is not indispensable to the national in­terest" and if, at all,
"the 'dispute' involves only a minority faction in the UNION."
Alternatively, peti­tioner contends that the industrial court's assumption of
jurisdiction in this case would "set at naught the return-to-work
agreement ... between the COMPANY and the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>, impair
the obligation of an existing collective bargaining agreement . . . . . and
violate the Industrial Peace Act and weaken the system of free and voluntary
collective bargaining." (p. 12, Petition)</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as this Court is concerned, there can be no argument
against the validity and efficacy of the presidential certification here in
issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner argues that the President's
action was issued on erron­eous factual bases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether it was so issued or not, this Court is not constitutionally
permitted to inquire into, in exactly the same manner that the Executive cannot
refuse to accord respect and sanction to a decision of this Court merely for
the reason that in his opinion the same is without sufficient factual <span style="">or </span>legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the principle of separation of
powers among the three great departments of our government, the legislative,
the executive and the judicial, with its necessary implications of independence
from and<span style=""> </span>interdependence upon
each other, would be a myth wherein it is most likely that the judiciary would
be supreme, a role naturally to be relished but firmly not to be desired, if it
will cause the abandonment of a juridical and constitutional formula that has
served through the de­cades as the invulnerable bastion of individual liberties
as well as the indestructible cornerstone of the rule of law in this country.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As <span class="GramE">We</span>
see it, the root issue of jurisdiction in </span>this case related to the
validity of the challenged presi­dential certification cannot be resolved on
the factual premises assumed by the industrial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is here a vital issue of fact, which
unfortunately, as stated at the outset of this opinion, the respondent court
omitted to resolve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the question
of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span>
and his co-signers of the disputed agreements were legitimate officers of the
respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that petitioner's principal ob­jection to the
assumption of jurisdiction by the respond­ent court was that there was no
longer any labor dispute which said court could arbitrate at the time of the
issu­ance of the presidential certification on October 22,1965 because as early
as October 14, 1965, petitioner Company and respondent Union had already forged
a return to work agreement that put an end to the strike declared by the latter
against the former in May of that year and that, furthermore, the parties were
already negotiating and were well on the way to formalizing a renewal of their
collective bargaining agreement which was due to expire on December 6, 1965,
as, in fact, such an agreement was signed by the Union and the Company on
December 23, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Putting aside the question
of whether or not the alleged return-to-work agreement of October 14th and the
claimed actual termination of the strike on said date should be considered as
having foreclosed the legality or propriety of the issuance of any presidential
certification of the dispute between petitioner and the respondent Union, it
being clear that compulsory arbitration may be certified by the President as
long as, in his opinion, a "labor dispute", which this Court has
defined as "any contro­versy concerning the terms, conditions and tenure
of em­ployment,"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
exists in an industry indispensable to the national interest, whether a strike
therein be impending, going on or already terminated without a final settlement
of the dispute, We are of the opinion that the conclusion of the negotiations
for a collective bargaining agreement on December 23, 1965, if entered into by
those properly authorized to do so, could have ousted the jurisdiction of the
CIR, except to determine whether or not said agree­ment was not contrary to
law, morals or public policy, in line with the dominant policy of the
Industrial Peace <span style="">Act </span>of favoring
unionism and free bargaining between labor and management as against compulsory
arbitration with go­vernmental intervention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Section 1, Republic Act 875).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not appear, however, that, although the petition­er's motion for
reconsideration was still pending in the CIR at the time of the said agreement
on December 23, the same was brought to its attention, much less made the basis
of any pleading.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, as matters stood in the respondent court when it
denied petitioner's motion for reconsidera­tion, there was already signed
between the petitioner and, purportedly, the respondent Union a collective
bargaining agreement, and, if, contrary to the allegations of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span>, the persons who signed the same as officers of the
Union were the legitimate officers they represented them­selves to be, it would
be quite clear that the industrial court should have declared itself without
further basis or authority to continue trying to arbitrate between parties who
have already settled the differences between themsel­ves, precisely in the
manner sought to be encouraged and protected by the Industrial Peace Act - free
collective bargaining - or, it should have, at least, suspended the proceedings
until the decisive issue of who were the genuine and legitimate officers of the
Union had been set­tled by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as
contended by herein respondents, <span class="SpellE">Jua­nito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span> and the others who signed the agreement as officers
of the Union "had no right to represent the Union and the strikers"
(p. 5, Respondents' Brief) and that the agreement signed by them "was
unauthorized, spurious, illegal and immoral, (p. <span style="">8, </span>Id.) there can be no question that the jurisdiction and authority
of the respondent court remained unaffected by the said collec­tive bargaining
agreement relied upon by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
purpose of a presidential certification is nothing more than to bring about
soonest, thru arbitration by <span style="">the in</span>dustrial court, a fair and just solution of the differences
between an employer and his workers regarding the terms and conditions of work
in the industry concerned which in the opinion of the President involves the na­tional
interest, so that the damage such employer-worker dispute might cause upon the
national interest may be minimized as much as possible, if not totally <span style="">averted </span>by
avoiding the stoppage of work as a result of <span style="">a strike or </span>lock out or any lagging of
the activities of the industry or the possibility of these contingencies which
might cause detriment to such national interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the foundation of that court's
jurisdiction in what may be termed as a certification case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, if the employer and the workers
are able to arrive at an amicable settlement by free and voluntary collective
bargaining preferably thru a labor union, before the court is able to use its
good offices, it is but in consonance with the objective of the Industrial
Peace Act to pro­mote unionism and free collective bargaining that the court
should step out of the picture and declare its function in the premises at an
end, except as it may be­come necessary to determine whether or not the
agreement forged by the parties is not contrary to law, morals or public
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from the terms of
Section 10 of the Act, from which the industrial court derives its jurisdiction
in a certification case, since it expressly provides that "the Court may
issue an order fix­ing the terms and conditions of employment", "if
no other solution to the dispute is found." Besides, a pre­sidential
certification to the industrial court automati­cally makes operative in regard
to the certified dispute all the provisions of Commonwealth Act 103 needed to
carry out the intent of said section of the Industrial Peace Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and among the provisions which so come into play is the second paragraph of
Section <span style="">4 </span>which reads thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">"The Court shall, before hearing the dispute and in the
course of such hearing, endeavor to reconcile the parties and induce them to
set­tle the dispute by amicable agree­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If any agreement as to the whole or any part of the dispute is arrived
at by the parties, a memo­randum of its terms shall be made in writing, signed
and acknowledged by the parties thereto before the Judge of the Court or any
official acting in his behalf and authorized to administer oaths or acknowledg­ments,
or, before a notary public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
memorandum shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Court, <span style="">and, unless otherwise ordered by the Court,
shall, as between the parties to the agreement, have the same ef­fect as, and
be deemed to be, a deci­sion or award."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Otherwise stated, in the case at bar, We need not decide whether
or not the return-to-work agreement of October 14, 1965 rendered the
presidential certification on October 22, 1965 factually and legally baseless
or inoperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it incumbent
upon Us to rule here whether or not a presidential certification once issued
can be withdrawn, and, consequently, whether or not the presidential certification
herein involved may be considered as withdrawn in view of the favorable re­commendation
to such effect by the Undersecretary of La­bor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that We hold now is that the entering into a voluntary and valid
collective bargaining agreement between an employer and a labor union of its
workers before or after a presidential certification is issued under Section 10
of the Industrial Peace Act ousts the juris­diction of the Court of Industrial
Relations, except as to the question of whether or not the agreement is con­trary
to law, morals or public policy, should such ques­tion be raised by any of the
parties, and in this connec­tion and with respect to the laborers or workers,
whether the question be raised by the Union as such or by any of the members
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the workers represented by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bocobo</span> constitute a mere "minority faction" and
as such they do not have legal personality to obstruct the course of the
return-to-work and collective bargaining agreements entered into by the
majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trouble with this argument
is that except for the casual reference in the order of November 11, 1965 to
"200 others" which <span style="">seem to
indicate the number of workers who did not return to work pursuant to the
return-to-work agreement of Octo­ber 14th, the record is remarkably bare of any
facts or evidence on which this Court may make a factual finding in connection
with the point raised by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span>any
event, the majority rule is not an absolute one in la­bor cases of this kind.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
More importantly, as already indicated above, any number of members of a labor
union may question, in the appropriate cases, any agreement entered into by <span style="">its </span>officers or the majority if it is
contrary to law, morals or public policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, even if We do not consider respondents' contention that strictly
speaking, the presidential certification here refers expressly not to the Union
but to the members thereof as being the ones having a dispute with petitioner,
a point which, to be sure, We cannot decide since there are not enough facts in
the record for the purpose, it is quite clear that the pivotal issue in this
case is the due representation of the Union in the collective bargaining
agreement in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, what the respondent court should have determined was
whether or not <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabuyan</span>
and the others who signed the agreements relied upon by petition­er, as
officers of respondent <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, were duly chosen by the
majority of the members as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
this important factual point is decided, the respondent court may proceed to
resolve the rights of the parties in line with views expressed in the above
opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of November 11, 1965 of re­spondent
court is affirmed in so far as it ordered the return to work of all the workers
of petitioner, except the 33 strikers who have been charged criminally, and
their acceptance by the petitioner, but this case is ordered returned to
respondent court for further proceed­ings in accordance with the above opinion
regarding the effect of the purported renewal collective bargaining agreement
of December 23, 1965 upon its jurisdiction ac­quired by virtue of presidential
certification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without
