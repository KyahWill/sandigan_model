specifically the portion thereof condemning Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., to pay
to Marta Lim <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>,
et. al., the sum of P30,691.92 <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> with <span class="SpellE">Ananias</span> Isaac <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> for violation
of an injunction, this appeal is taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of record that in 1937, <span class="SpellE">Ananias</span>
Isaac <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> bound himself in writing to turn over
to Victor <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> one-half (1/2) of the proceeds from
all mining claims that he would purchase with the money to be advanced by the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This agreement was later on
modified (in a 1939 <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> instrument duly
registered with the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>
in his capacity as mining recorder) so as to include in the equal sharing
arrangement not only the proceeds from several mining claims, which by that
time had already been purchased by <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> with
various sums <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P5,800.00 supplied by <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>, but also the lands constituting the same, and so as
to bind thereby their "heirs, assigns, or legal
representatives".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the
mining rights over part of the claims were assigned by <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>
to Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., sometime before World War II because in 1950 the
corporation paid him P5,000 in consideration of, and as a quitclaim for,
pre-war royalties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On several occasions thereafter, the mining claims in question
were made subject-matter of contracts entered into by <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>
in his own name and for his benefit alone without the slightest intimation of <span class="SpellE">Jimena's</span> interests over the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1951" day="19" month="9">19 September 1951</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> and
one Alejandro Marquez, as separate owners of particular mining claims, entered
into an agreement with Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., the assignee thereof,
regarding allotment to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> of 45% of the
royalties due from the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four
months later, <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>, Marquez and Congressman <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manguerra</span>, again as
owners, leased certain mining claims to Jacob Cabarrus, who, in turn,
transferred to <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc.,
his rights under the lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue of still another contract executed by these <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>
on <st1:date year="1952" day="29" month="2">29 February 1952</st1:date>, 43% of
the royalties due from <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents,
Inc., were agreed upon to be paid to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as August, 1939 and down to September, 1952, <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> repeatedly apprised Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., and <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc., of his interests over
the mining claims so assigned and/or leased by <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>
and, accordingly, demanded recognition and payment of his one-half share in all
the royalties allocated and paid and, thereafter, to be paid to the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both cor­porations, however,
ignored <span class="SpellE">Jimena’s</span> demands.</p>

<p class="BODY">Payment of the P5,800 advanced for the purchase of the mining
claims, as well as the one-half share in the royalties paid by the two
corporations, were also repeatedly demanded by <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>
from <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acknowledging <span class="SpellE">Jimena's</span> contractual claim, <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> off and on promised to settle his obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="7">14 July 1952</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> promised,
for the last time, to settle everything or before the 30th day of the same
month.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>, however, did not only fail to
settle his accounts with <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> but transferred on 16
August 1952, a month after he promised to pay <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>,
35 of his 45% share in the royalties due from Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., to
one Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, a salaried employee, for an
alleged consideration of P10,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="9">2 September 1954</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> commenced a suit against <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>
for recovery of his advances and his one-half share in the royalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., and <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc., together with <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, were later joined as defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="17" month="9">17 September 1954</st1:date>,
the trial court issued, upon petition of <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>, a
writ of preliminary injunction restraining Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., and <span class="SpellE">Marin­duque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc., from paying royalties
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>, his assigns or legal representatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the injunction, however, Gold Star
Mining Co., Inc., was found out to have paid P30,691.92 to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said corporation claimed later on (on appeal) that the in­junction had
been superseded and/or dissolved on 25 May 1955 by the trial court's grant of <span class="SpellE">Jimena's</span> petition for a writ of preliminary attachment
"to supersede the writ of preliminary injunction previously
issued".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as the grant was con­ditioned
upon filing of a bond to be approved by the trial court, no writ of at­tachment
was issued because the bond offered by <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> was
disapproved.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
died successively during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case in
the trial court and were, accordingly, substituted by their respective widows
and children.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment, all four defendants, namely, <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>, the widow and children of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
and the two corporations, appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal interposed by <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>
Iron Mines Agents, Inc., was, however, withdrawn, while that of <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> was dismissed for his failure to file brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending outcome of the appeal, the royalties
due from Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., were required to be deposited with the
trial court, as per order of <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="6">17 June
 1958</st1:date> issued by the same court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In compliance therewith, Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., made a judicial
deposit in the amount of P30,691.92.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="10">8 October 1965</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals handed down a decision sustaining in its entirety that of
the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gold Star Mining Co., Inc.,
moved for re­consideration of said decision insofar as Its adjudged <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability with <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>
to pay to the <span class="SpellE">Jimenas</span> the sum of P30,691.92 "for
flagrant violation of the injunction" was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., argues that the Court of
Appeals' decision finding that respondents <span class="SpellE">Jimenas</span>
have a cause of action against it, and condemning it to pay the sum of
P30,691.92 for violation of an allegedly non-existent injunction, are
reversible errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to respondents <span class="SpellE">Jimenas</span>'
cause of action, the same does not allegedly appear in the complaint filed
against petitioner corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as
to the P30,691.92 penalty for violation of the injunction, the same can not
allegedly be imposed because (1) the sum of P30,691.92 was not prayed for; (2)
the injunction in question had already been superseded and/or dissolved by the
trial court's grant of <span class="SpellE">Jimena’s</span> petition for writ of
preliminary attachment; and (3) the corporation was never charged, heard, nor
found guilty in accordance with, and pursuant to, the provisions of Rule 64 of
the (Old) Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the same opinion with the Court of Appeals that
respondents<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jimenas</span>
have a cause of action against petitioner corporation and that the latter's <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> as one of the defendants before the trial court is
fitting and proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Court of
Appeals, and we adopt the same:</p>

<blockquote>"The first assigned error is the Trial Court erred in not
dismissing this instant action as 'there is no <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of contract between Gold Star and <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>.' This
contention is without merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The situation at bar is similar to the status of the first
and second mortgagees of a duly registered real estate mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there exists no <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of contract between them, yet the common subject-matter supplies the juridical
link.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Here the evidence overwhelmingly established that <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> made prewar and postwar demands upon Gold Star for
the payment of his 1/2 share of the royalties but all in vain so he (<span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>) was constrained to <span class="SpellE">implead</span>
Gold Star because it refused to recognize his right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> now seeks for accounting of
the royalties paid by Gold Star to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> and for
direct payment to himself of his share of the royalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This relief cannot be granted without joining
the Gold Star specially in the face of the attitude it had displayed towards <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Borrowing the Spanish maxim cited by <span class="SpellE">Jimena's</span>
counsel, 'el <span class="SpellE">deudor</span> de mi <span class="SpellE">deudor</span>
<span class="SpellE">es</span> <span class="SpellE">deudor</span> <span class="SpellE">mfo</span>,' this legal maxim finds sanction in Article 1177, new
Civil Code which provides that 'creditors, after having pursued the property in
possession of the debtor to satisfy their claims, may exercise all the rights
and bring all the actions of the latter (debtor) for the same purpose, save
those which are inherent in his person; they may also impugn the acts which the
debtor may have done to defraud them (1111)'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From another standpoint, equally valid and ac­ceptable, it
can be said that <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>, in transferring the mining
claims to Gold Star (without disclosing that <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>
was a co-owner although Gold Star had knowledge of this fact as shown by the
proofs heretofore mentioned) acted as <span class="SpellE">Jimena's</span> agent
with respect to <span class="SpellE">Jimena's</span> share of the claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under such conditions, <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> has
an action against Gold Star, pursuant to Article 1883, New Civil Code, which
provides that the principal may sue the person with whom the agent dealt with
in his (agent's) own name, when the transaction 'involves things belonging to
the principal.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As counsel for <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> has correctly
contended, 'the remedy of garnishment suggested by Gold Star is utterly
inadequate for the enforcement of <span class="SpellE">Jimena's</span> right
against <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> because <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>
wanted an accounting and wanted to receive directly his share of the royalties
from Gold Star.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That recourse is not
open to <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span> un­less Gold Star is made a party in
this action'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the violation of the injunction, we observe that
the facts speak for themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that no writ of preliminary attachment was issued by the
trial court, the condition for its issuance not having been met by <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>, nothing can be said to have superseded the writ of
preliminary injunction in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
preliminary injunction was, therefore, subsisting and evidently violated by
petitioner corporation when it paid the sum of P30,691.92 to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., insists that it may not be penalized
for breach of the injunction, issued by the court of origin, without prior
written charge for indirect contempt, and due hearing, citing section 3 of Rule
64 of the old Rules of Court, now Rule 71 of the Revised Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We fail to see any merit in this contention,
as it misses the true nature and intent of the award of P30,691.92 to <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>, payable <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> by
Gold Star and <span class="SpellE">Lincallo's</span> estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said award is not so much a penalty against petitioner as a
decree of restitution, in order to make the violated injunction effective, as
it should be, by placing the parties in the same condition as if the injunction
had been fully obeyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Gold Star
Mining Co., Inc., had only heeded the injunction and had not paid to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span> the royalties of P30,691.92, such amount would now
be available for the satisfaction of the claims of <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>
and his heirs against <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By sentencing Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., to
pay, for the account of <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>, the sum aforesaid,
the court merely <span class="SpellE">endeavoured</span> to prevent its award
from being rendered <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>tanto</u></span> nugatory
and ineffective, and thus make it confor­mable to law and justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the questioned award was not intended to be a penalty
against appellant Gold Star Mining Co., Inc., is shown by the provision in the
judgment that the P30,691.92 to be paid by it to <span class="SpellE">Jimena</span>
is "<u>to be imputed to <span class="SpellE">Lincallo's</span> liability</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>under this judgment".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court thus left the way open for Gold
Star Mining Co., Inc., to recover later the whole amount from <span class="SpellE">Lincallo</span>, whether by direct action against him or by
deducting it from the royalties that may fall due under his 1951 contract with
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the recovery of this particular amount was not specifically
sought in the complaint is of no moment, since the complaint prayed in general
for "other equitable relief".</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the decision
