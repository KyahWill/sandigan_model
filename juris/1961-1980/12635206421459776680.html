				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by petitioner Jose G. Lopez, from an order of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, dismissing Civil Case No. 67513 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1964, a conditional contract of purchase and sale was
entered into between the Reparations Commission and pe­titioner Lopez, whereby
the former awarded the M/V JOLO LEMA to Lopez in consideration of the total sum
of $174,900, payable on installments, as provided in Republic Act No. 1789, and
subject to the condition that the title to and ownership of the vessel shall re­main
with the Commission until full payment of the stipulated price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After registering the vessel with the
Philippine Fisheries Commission and securing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the requisite license in his name, as a fishing vessel, on July 21, 1966, Lopez
entered into a contract with one Tomas Velasco, authorizing the latter to
supervise and manage the M/V JOLO LEMA in - according to Lopez - only one
"legal fishing venture along and within Philippine waters and for no other
purpose." On September 19, 1966, the vessel was, how­ever, apprehended,
searched and then seized by the Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
at <span class="SpellE">Batjak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sasa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and Seizure Identification proceeding No. 25/66 was
instituted against said vessel for smuggling into the Philippines 1,408 sacks
of Indonesian copra and 86 sacks of Indonesian coffee beans, in violation of
section 2530(a) and (k) of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the seizure proceeding was pending hearing before the customs
authorities, on November 11, 1966, the Reparations Commission served upon Lopez
a written notice to the effect that, pur­suant to paragraph No. 4 of the Terms
and Conditions of the contract between them, the same was rescinded for using
the vessel in freight (smuggling) instead of fishing, failure, despite repeated
demands, to make the first payment without interest and to pay the first
install­ment with interest, due, respectively, on August 28, 1965, and Aug­ust
28, 1966, and failure to post the requisite insurance coverage, in violation of
said contract; that the present possession by the govern­ment, through the
Bureau of Customs, of the M/V JOLO LEMA was considered by the Commission as a
repossession of the vessel on its behalf; and that the payment already made, as
well as the overdue amounts under said contract have been forfeited by way of
rentals for the use of the vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently anticipating this move of the Commission, Lopez had,
the day before, or on November 10, 1966, filed with the Court of First Instance
of Manila Civil Case No. 67513 thereof, against "the Commissioner of
Customs, the Director of the National Bureau of Investigation, and/or any of
their authorized agents or represen­tatives," for <i>mandamus</i> and
prohibition with preliminary prohibitory and mandatory injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his petition therein, as amended on
November 28, 1966, and <span class="SpellE">reamended</span> on December 2, 1966,
Lopez prayed that "judgment be rendered declaring unlawful, illegal and
null and void, as contrary to law, the Seizure Identification No. 25/66 and the
seizure and custody over the subject fishing vessel by the respondents and/or
their representatives and/or their agents"; that "pending trial on
the merits, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> a
preliminary restraining order and/or preliminary writ of prohibitory and
mandatory injunc­tion be issued restraining and prohibiting the respondents
and/or their representatives and/or their agents from further seizure and
custody of said fishing vessel, and/or the Reparations Commission, or its
representatives and/or agents, from seizing and taking into their custody said
fishing vessel, and instead, all the respondents shall release the custody and
deliver the subject fishing vessel" to Lopez; and that, thereafter, said
writs be made "permanent and perpetual."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of the original petition in said Civil Case No.
67513, or, on November 10, 1966, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, as Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance
of Manila, issued a "restraining or <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> order, "
subject to such action as may be taken by the judge presiding the branch to
which the case may eventually be assigned through raffle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="11">November
 22, 1966</st1:date>, the Reparations Commission filed a motion to dismiss,
upon the ground of failure of the petition to allege a cause of action against
said Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the
Commissioner of Customs filed a "motion to dismiss with opposition to the
petition for a writ of preliminary injunction," upon the ground that, in
view of the afore­mentioned seizure proceeding, arising from the involvement of
the M/V JOLO LEMA in the smuggling of Indonesian agricultural pro­ducts into
the Philippines, the Court of First Instance of Manila has no jurisdiction to
try and decide the case, pursuant to the de­cision of the Supreme Court, dated
November 29, 1966, in <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>,
G.R. No. L-22526.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course
thereafter, Branch XVI of said court, presided over by Hon. Juan L. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>, Judge, issued an order, dated January 26, 1967,
denying the writ of pre­liminary injunction sought by Lopez and dismissing the
case, upon the authority of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this appeal taken by Lopez directly to the Supreme Court, upon
the ground that only questions of law would be taken up therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main question for determination in this appeal is whe­ther or
not the Court of First Instance of Manila has jurisdiction to interfere with
the Seizure Identification proceeding No. 25/66 pend­ing before the
Commissioner of Customs, on account of the Indone­sian agricultural products
smuggled into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
through the use of the M/V JOLO LEMA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
similar question was decided by this Court in the negative in the
aforementioned case of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>,
<u>supra</u>, upon which Judge <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span> relied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, We held:</p>

<blockquote>"The Tariff and Customs Code, in Section 2530 thereof, lists
the kinds of property subject to forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, in Part 2 of Title VI thereof, it pro­vides for the
procedure in seizure and forfeiture cases and vests in the Collector of Customs
the authority to hear and decide said cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Collector's decision is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the
Commissioner of Customs whose decision is in turn <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Court of Tax Ap­peals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
aggrieved party may appeal from a judg­ment of the Court of Tax Appeals
directly to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 lodges in the Court of First
Instance original jurisdiction in all cases in which the value of the pro­perty
in controversy amounts to more than ten thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This original jurisdiction of the Court of
First Instance, when exercised in an action for recovery of personal property
which is a subject of a forfeiture proceeding in the Bureau of Customs, tends
to encroach upon, and to render futile, the jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs in seizure and forfeiture proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is precisely what took place in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seizure and forfeiture proceedings
against the M/B '<span class="SpellE">Bukang</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwayway</span>'
before the Collector of Customs of Manila, was stifled by the issuance of a
writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Should Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 give way to
the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code, or vice versa?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Our opinion, in this particular case, the
Court of First Instance should yield to the jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the
Collector of Customs is provided for in Republic Act 1937 which took effect on <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>, much later than the
Judiciary Act of 1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic
that a later law prevails over a prior statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, on grounds of public policy, it is more reasonable to conclude
that the legislators intended to divest the Court of First Instance of the
prerogative to <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> a property which is a subject
of a seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, actions for forfeiture
of property for violation of Customs laws could easily be undermined by the
simple device of <span class="SpellE">reple­vin</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code requires
the Collector of Customs to give to the owner of the property sought to be for­feited
written notice of the seizure and to give him the opportunity to be heard in
his defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pro­vision clearly
indicates the intention of the law to confine in the Bureau of Customs the
determination of all questions affecting the disposal of property proceeded
against in a seizure and forfeiture case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judicial recourse of the property owner is not in the Court of First
Instance but in the Court of Tax Appeals, and only after exhausting administra­tive
remedies in the Bureau of Customs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This view has been repeatedly reiterated by this Court<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and We find no plausible reason to depart <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Invoking section 5 of Republic Act No. 3512, which provides, in
part, that -</p>

<blockquote>"All powers, functions and duties heretofore exercised by the
Bureau of Customs, Philippine Navy and Philippine Constabulary over fishing ves­sels
and fishery matters are hereby transferred to and vested in the Philippine Fisheries
Commission x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Lopez maintains that whatever powers the
Commissioner of Customs had, prior thereto, over seizure identification
proceedings had been transferred to the Philippine Fisheries Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is manifestly devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said section 5 of Republic Act No. 3512
merely transfers to the Philippine Fisheries Commission the powers, functions
and duties of the Bureau of Customs, the Philip­pine Navy and the Philippine
Constabulary over fishing vessels and <u>fishery matters</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such transfer should be construed in the
light of section 1 of said Republic Act No. 3512, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"It is hereby declared a national policy to encourage, promote
and conserve our fishing resources in order to insure a steady and sufficient
supply of fish, and other fishery products for our increasing population, and
to reduce to a minimum level possible the importation of such produce so as to
help stabilize the national economy by enlarging the office charged with the
development, improvement, management and conservation of our fishery
resources."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the powers transferred to the Philippine
Fisheries Commission by Republic Act No. 3512 are limited to those relating to
the "development, improvement, management and conservation of our <u>fishery
resources</u>." All other matters, such as those concerning smuggling,
particularly of <u>agricultural</u> products, into the Philippines, are
absolutely foreign to the object and purpose of said Act and could not have
been and were not trans­ferred to the aforementioned Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seizure Identification proceeding No. 25/66
for the smuggling of Indonesian <u>agricultural</u> products into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is certainly beyond the jurisdiction of the Philippine Fisheries Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged that, pursuant to section 2530 of the Tariff and
Customs Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Property subject to forfeiture under tariff and customs
laws</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any vessel or aircraft,
cargo, articles and other objects shall, under the following conditions, be
subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any vessel or aircraft, including cargo, which
shall be used unlawfully in the importation or exportation of articles into or
from any Philippine port or place except a port of entry; and any vessel which,
being of less than thirty tons capacity shall be used in the importation of
articles into any Phi­lippine port or place except into a port of the <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> sea where importation in such vessel may be author­ized
by the Commissioner, with the approval of the department head.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the M/V JOLO LEMA is not subject to forfeiture,
inasmuch as <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
is a port of entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is neither the
time nor the place to pass upon the merits of this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that, if petitioner feels
it is a good defense, the proper place to set it up is in Seizure Identification
proceeding No. 25/66.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Commissioner of Customs overrules such defense and decrees the forfeiture of
the vessel, Lopez may appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals, whose decision may,
in turn, be reviewed by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, said section 2530 does not justify interference by the
Court of First In­stance in Seizure Identification proceeding No. 25/66.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span>, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondents, however, notwithstanding the compelling force of
the above doctrines, would assert that respondent Judge could entertain the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> suit as the seizure is illegal, allegedly because
the warrant issued is invalid and the seizing officer like­wise was devoid of
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is to lose sight of the
distinction, as earlier made mention of, bet­ween the existence of the power
and the regularity of the proceeding taken under it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The governmental agency concerned, the Bureau
of Customs, is vested with exclusive authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if it be assumed that in the exercise of such exclusive competence
a taint of illegality may be correctly imputed, the most that can be said is
that under certain circumstances the grave abuse of discretion conferred may
oust it of such jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does
not mean however that correspondingly a court of first instance is vested with
competence when clearly in the light of the above decisions the law has not
seen fit to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeding before
the Collector of Customs is not final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An appeal lies to the Commissioner of Customs and thereafter to the
Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may even reach
this Court through the appropriate petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proper ventilation of the legal issues
raised is thus indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly a
court of first instance is not therein included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is devoid of jurisdiction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, petitioner argues that the Reparations Commission may not
unilaterally rescind its conditional contract of purchase and sale in his favor
and that the Commission must first seek a judicial declaration of rescission of
said contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is, however,
the rule that a judicial action for the rescission of a contract is not
necessary where the contract provides that it may be revoked and cancelled for
violation of any of its terms and conditions.</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
validity of the stipulation cannot be seriously disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in the nature of a facul­tative <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span> condition, which in many cases has been upheld x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> x."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The contract of conditional sale in favor of Lopez expressly
grants the Reparations Commission the option to rescind the con­tract in the
event of non-compliance by Lopez with the provisions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph No. 4 of the Terms and Conditions
of said con­tract explicitly provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Should the Conditional Vendee fail to pay any of the yearly
installments when due, or utilize the goods for any illicit purpose or for
purposes other than that for which the goods have been procured, or otherwise
fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this contract, or with
any of the applicable provisions of the Reparations Law and/or of the Rules and
Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, then the Conditional Vendor is hereby
given the option to either rescind the contract upon notice to the Conditional
Vendee, in which case all sums already paid by the Conditional Vendee shall be
for­feited as rentals in favor of the Conditional Vendor, and also that the
Conditional Vendee shall deliver to the Conditional Vendor the property subject
of this contract or to sue for specific performance in which case the whole
amount remaining unpaid under this contract shall immediately become due and
payable, and in either case whether the suit is for rescission or specific
performance, the Conditional Vendee shall be liable to pay the Conditional
Vendor in the concept of liquidated damages equivalent to 10% of the total
procurement value of the goods."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed,
