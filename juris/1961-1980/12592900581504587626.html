				<H3>COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. CADWALLADER PACIFIC COMPANY, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>Disputed by Cadwallader Pacific Company<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> before the Court of Tax Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> is the assessment made by the Commissioner 
of In- ternal Revenue<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in the amount of 
P3,651.23 covering fixed and percentage taxes and surcharges, as commercial 
broker for the years 1955 to 1957. The Commissioner's alternative defense is 
that Cadwallader "is a commercial broker because it brought about sales or 
purchases of merchandise between its local customers in the Philippines and its 
branch office at Arcadia, California, or through its intervention brought about 
proposed buyers and foreign sellers together by executing the contract in the 
Philippines between the buyers and the petitioner" below, Cadwallader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>The judgment below declared that the assessment against Cadwallader 
"concerning the fixed and percentage taxes and surcharge as commercial broker in 
the sum of p3,651.23 must be, as the same is hereby, set aside". The 
Commissioner appealed.</p>
<p>Cadwallader is a Philippine corporation with branch office at Arcadia, 
California, United States of America, Cadwallader's primary purpose, as stated 
in its Articles of Incorporation, is "[T]o buy, manufacture, produce, or 
otherwise sell, import, export, trade and deal in general merchandise, goods, 
wares, food products and commodities of every kind and description," and, as one 
of its secondary purposes, "to act as financial, commercial, general agent or 
factor of, or to undertake management of any person, partnership, corporation, 
or association carrying on any transaction or negotiation or any business of 
manufacturing or dealing in all kinds of goods, wares, merchandise, food 
products and commodities of every kind and description, and, while acting as 
such agent, factor or manager, to perform such acts, enter into such obligations 
and carry on such transactions as shall tend to promote the interests that the 
corporation shall represent".</p>
<p>The branch of the company in the United States serves as its buying 
office.</p>
<p>We now come to the transactions for which the Commissioner holds Cadwallader 
liable for the commercial broker's fixed and percentage taxes. A written 
contract is executed in Manila between Cadwallader and its local customers, a 
sample of which follows: </p>

<p>The contract as executed in Manila is forwarded to the California branch 
which procures the goods described therein, ships them direct to the buyer on 
its own invoice. Title to the goods passes from the seller to the buyer from the 
time goods are shipped in California. The merchandise is shipped, travels and is 
insured for the account and risk of the buyer. Taxes and duties are also for the 
buyer's account.</p>
<p>Our problem is to ascertain whether or not Cadwallader is within the reach of 
the term <i>commercial broker or commission merchant </i>set out in Section 
194(t) of the Tax Code, <i>viz</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(t) 'Commercial broker' includes all persons, other than importers, 
manufacturers, producers, or <i>bona fide</i> employees, who, for compensation 
or profit, sell or bring about sales or purchases of merchandise for other 
persons, or bring pro- posed buyers and sellers together, or negotiate freights 
or other business for owners of vessels, or other means of transportation, or 
for the shippers, or consignors or consignees of freight carried by vessels or 
other means of transportation. The term includes commission 
merchants."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<ol><li>We canvass the facts and circumstances. These are: The contract ) through 
and through names Cadwallader as the seller, the customer its buyer. The 
irrevocable letters of credit are drawn by the buyer in favor of the seller — 
not of anybody else. No payment is made by the local customer to any 
manufacturer or supplier abroad. Cadwallader exclusively owns the price paid by 
the customer, Cadwallader is not accountable to the manufacturer or supplier for 
the amount represented by the letters of credit. The California branch office 
<i>buys</i> the goods ordered. This is a fact confirmed by the report of the 
Commissioner's examiner, dated February 8, 1957.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>The list of goods sold and prices charged 
is sent by the California branch, as shipper, direct to the buyer. In the 
invoice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6] </sup>the "shipper" is 
Cadwallader's California branch, not the manufacturer or supplier. That invoice 
bears the certification by the California branch as to "the person from whom the 
same [merchandise] was purchased".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> No 
privity of contract exists between Cadwallader's buyer and the foreign 
manufacturer or supplier. In fact, nowhere in the transaction do we find any 
mention of a foreign manufacturer or supplier who is unknown to the buyer, 
Cadwallader assumes the risk of non-payment by the buyer; the latter is 
responsible to Cadwallader alone for its failure to comply with the contract. So 
it is, that in case of suit, the buyer's action is direct against Cadwallader 
and the latter's, against the former. Cadwallader does not act as negotiator or 
middleman to close a deal between one person and another, does not work or 
contract in the name of another. In this factual environment, Cadwallader if<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> not a commercial broker. Because, as we have 
said "[l]n all the cases, under all and varying forms of expression, the 
fundamental and correct doctrine is, that <i>the duty assumed by the broker is 
to bring the minds of the buyer and seller to an agreement for a salef and the 
price and terms on which it is to be made</i> x x x".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br>Even in those cases where a contract of 
sale like the one before us was executed, but merchandise was to be shipped by a 
<i>definite supplier abroad</i> contracted by the seller and known to the buyer, 
this Court held that the former (seller) did not come within the legal concept 
of broker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]<br><br></sup>
</li><li>We find less than persuasive the Commissioner's argument that Cadwallader 
never acquired title to the goods it sold to the buyer. The position he takes is 
that said title was transferred directly from the foreign manufacturer to the 
local buyer. Reliance he places on the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 4 of the 
contract of sale, <i>viz</i>; <br><br>"2.—The SELLER may ship any portion of the 
merchandise as soon as completed at the manufacturer's works, and/or made ready 
for shipment, and payment for any portion of the goods as shipped shall become 
due in accordance with the terms of payment specified on the reverse side 
hereof."<br><br>"4.—Title to merchandise shall pass to BUYER at time of 
shipment. The merchandise called for in this contract shall be shipped, traveled 
and be insured for account and risk of the BUYER, and the responsibility of the 
SELLER shall cease once the shipping documents have been signed by the steamship 
company and delivered to the forwarding Bank".<br><br>We do not read in the 
above-quoted stipulations any statement which would as much as induce belief 
that Cadwallader did not acquire title to the goods it sold to the local buyer. 
Paragraph 2 merely fixes the time when the seller shall ship a portion of the 
merchandise to the buyer. Paragraph 4 specifies when title to the goods shall 
pass to the buyer. Petitioner offered no evidence to prove that Cadwallader had 
no title to the goods it sold, whereas there is testimonial evidence that 
Cadwallader's branch in the United States <i>buys</i> the goods ordered by local 
customers and ships the same to the latter. At all events, "[T]he fact that the 
subject matter of the sale is not in the actual possession of the seller does 
not affect his general right to sell it and transfer the title."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>
</li><li>Of course, the Commissioner is correct in the statement that, by statute, 
the term, "commercial broker" includes commission merchant. But not as correct 
is the Commissioner's claim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> that 
Cadwallader is a commission merchant. For, a commission merchant is defined 
thus: "A 'commission merchant' x x x as he is generally known x x x is a 
commercial agent to whom the possession of personalty is entrusted by or for the 
owner, to be sold, for a compensation, in pursuance of the agent's usual trade 
or business, with title to goods remaining in principal - x x x as distinguished 
from person who purchases merchandise with his own capital, takes title in his 
own name, and sells for his own account at whatever price he may deem 
advisable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>And, "[A] 
'commission merchant' differs from a broker in that he may buy and sell in his 
own name without disclosing his principal, while the broker can only buy or sell 
in the name of his principal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]<br><br></sup>Needless to repeat, Cadwallader 
does not come within the coverage of either of these two concepts.</li></ol>
<p>For the reasons given, the appealed judgment must be, as it is hereby, 
affirmed. No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
