				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by defendants <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tailisan</span> <span class="SpellE">Cama­rodin</span>, from a decision, of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
convicting them of the crime of robbery with homicide, with which they are
charged, and sentencing them to life imprisonment, with the accessory penalties
provided by law, to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza in the sum of P6,000, in addition to the
sum of P180, representing the value of the objects stolen from him, and each to
pay one-half of the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts established by the prosecution are correctly set forth
in the appealed decision, from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence of the prosecution show that in the morning of
July 28, 1965, while <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza was driving a
tractor plowing the farm of Luis <span class="SpellE">Ocsio</span> at Masao, <span class="SpellE">Lalabuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> with Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>, accused <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tailisan</span> <span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span>, approached the tractor while at a standstill
and, at a distance of four steps from the tractor, accused <span class="SpellE">Tago</span>
<span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, shot <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>
Mendoza with a pistol while Mendoza was sitting on the driver's seat holding
the steering wheel of the tractor; that when <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza he
was at the right side of the tractor while <span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span>
was at the left side six <span class="SpellE">brazas</span> from <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza; that <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza five
times and the latter slumped dead on the steering wheel after he was shot; that
after <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Men­doza, <span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span> told
<span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> to get the
revolver and watch of Mendoza so that <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> took said revolver valued at P120.00 and watch
valued at P60.00; that after <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>
took the watch and revolver of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza, he
fired at Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>, who was then ten meters
away from the tractor, but Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> was not
hit and he ran away towards the house of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Mendoza,
the father of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza where they were
living; that on his way, he met Alfonso Mendoza, the brother of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>, and told Alfonso Mendoza that <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>
Mendoza was shot by Mus­lims; that before the incident, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> was familiar with the face of both accused but
not their names because they were neighbors and often times saw them; that the
dead body of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza was examined by Dr.
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lucido</span> on July 28, 1965 less than one hour
after death and found five gunshot wounds as described in the Medical
Certificate, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A', as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'POSTMORTEM FINDINGS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wound gunshot entrance 9 mm diameter located
at the right posterior <span class="SpellE">sygamatic</span> bone, exit 12 mm
diameter at the left superior border temporal bone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two gunshot wound entrance roughly oval in
shape 9 mm in diameter located at the mid <span class="SpellE">axillary</span>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wound gunshot entrance roughly oval in shape 9
mm diameter located at the mid <span class="SpellE">axillary</span> line right
level of the 7th rib, exit oval in shape 12 mm by 15 mm loca­ted at superior
border of the left scapula.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wound gunshot entrance roughly oval in shape 9
mm diameter located at the mid <span class="SpellE">axillary</span> line level of
the 10th rib, no exit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CAUSES OF
DEATH:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hemorrhage severe internal and
external due to multiple gunshot', and that the dead body of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza was buried in the cemetery of <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, the next day."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense tried to impeach the testimony of Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> upon the ground that he had, at first, identified
<span class="SpellE">Usman</span> Moro as the person who killed <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants, moreover, set up their respective alibis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> would have Us believe that, on July 28, 1965, he was
in the coconut plantation of <span class="SpellE">Maitowamama</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>, four kilometers away from the scene of the
occurrence, from early morning to long after noontime, whereas <span class="SpellE">Tailisan</span> <span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span> claimed that
he was then fishing in <span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
about 55 kilometers away, where he stayed for three days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Commenting on these alibis, His Honor, the trial Judge, said:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence of denial and alibi put up by both accused could
not prevail over the clear, explicit and positive identification of both
accused by prosecution witness, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>,
as the very person who shot and robbed <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>
Mendoza of his .45 caliber pistol and wrist watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that alibi is the weakest of all
defenses and easy to concoct and the alibi of accused, <span class="SpellE">Tago</span>
<span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, was merely established by the testimony of
his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Maitowamama</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>,
and the alibi of accused, <span class="SpellE">Tailisan</span> <span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span>, was merely corroborated by his brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sadon</span>, said defense of
denial and alibi could not prevail over the positive identification of both
accused by Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> as the authors of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Luomayag</span>,
L-19142, March 31, 1965; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amiril</span> <span class="SpellE">Asmawil</span>, L-18761, March 19, 1965; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, et al., L-17599, April 24, 1967; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., L-16177, May 24,

May 30, 1964; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Susano</span>, et al., L-19098, May
31, 1964).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Besides, it could not be physically impossible for <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> to be at the scene of
the crime even if he was working in the coco­nut plantation of his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Maitowamama</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>, because
the distance is only four kilometers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is it physically impossible for <span class="SpellE">Tailisan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span> to be with <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> in committing the crime because the distance of his
house to the scene of the crime is only five kilometers so that it was easy for
him to imme­diately leave for <span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, fifty kilo­meters away just after the commission
of the crime by taking a truck in order to invent an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For alibi to prosper, it is not enough to
prove that the accused were somewhere when the crime was committed but that
they must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for them to
have been at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Caymo</span>, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.,
L-16177, May 24, 1967)."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are fully in agreement with this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span class="SpellE">Mangon­dato</span>
could not possibly recall the date on which <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> had allegedly worked with him, for he (<span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>) is not familiar with the Gregorian Calendar and
did not even know what date it was when he took the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither could <span class="SpellE">Camarodin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sadon</span> - who tried to corroborate the alibi of his
brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Tailisan</span> <span class="SpellE">Cama­rodin</span>
- reckon dates, so that the former could not be positive as to the date when
the latter was allegedly with him in <span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the identification of <span class="SpellE">Usman</span>
Moro by Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> as the person who had shot
<span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>, the following facts should be noted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the occurrence, the same
was reported to the Philippine Constabulary, which forthwith sent a team of
investigators, headed by then Captain Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Bangcola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The team divided itself into two (2)
groups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One, including a medical
officer, went to the house of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
where the body of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Men­doza had already been
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other proceeded to the scene
of the occurrence, which the members of the group examined and where they
picked up some empty cartridges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nearby,
they, likewise, found <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> Moro - who turned out to
be about ten (10) years old,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> although he was rather tall for his
age - who could not give a cate­gorical answer to the questions propounded to
him by the peace officers, who asked him to explain his presence in that
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, he was pale and
trembling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances led the
peace officers to suspect and detain him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, they brought him to the house of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There, the PC asked Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>
whether <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> Moro was the very person who had killed
<span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Al­though <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> answered in the
affirmative, he told Captain <span class="SpellE">Bangcola</span> that he (<span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>) was not certain about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, having been tipped that
defendants herein had been seen in the vici­nity of the scene of the
occurrence, Captain <span class="SpellE">Bangcola</span> bade the local chief of
police to pick them up for questioning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the chief of police did what he was told and brought the defendants
to the PC, <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> identified them positively as
the culprits, and admitted that he had committed a mistake when he, at first,
said that <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> Moro was one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>
executed, before the local muni­cipal judge, an affidavit to this effect, the
contents of which he rei­terated on the witness stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span> was barely
16 years old when he testified in court; that he had not even finished fourth
grade ele­mentary school; that, like <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> Moro, he
was, also, scared when the peace officers first interrogated him; that, soon
after, he con­fided to Captain <span class="SpellE">Bangcola</span> that he (<span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>) was not certain that <span class="SpellE">Usman</span>
Moro was one of those who had participated in the commission of the crime; that
he has no motive whatsoever to falsely incriminate appellants herein; and that
he had seen them several times before the occurrence, they being neighbors of
the <span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span>, for whom he had been working for one
(1) year, we find no reason to doubt either his veracity or the accuracy of his
testimony regarding the identity of the culprits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants maintain that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) "in appre­ciating facts not
introduced in evidence"; (2) "in convicting appel­lants for the crime
charged without Exhibit B having been admitted in evidence for the
prosecution"; and (3) "in holding that notice of appeal in criminal
cases perfected the appeal," and that, accord­ingly, their motion for
reconsideration, filed after the filing of their notice of appeal, could
"no longer be entertained" by said court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under their first assignment of error, it is urged that the lower
court was not justified in stating in the decision appealed that
"possession of a firearm is precious to a Muslim, hence the reason for the
robbery," no evidence having been introduced in support thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said statement reflects, however, a common belief
among Christians in <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place>, of which judicial
cognizance may be taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
even if the expression objected to were stricken out or disregarded, still
there is the positive testimony of Fernando <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>
to the effect that, after killing <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, upon
indication of his co-defendant, divested the deceased of his pistol and a wrist
watch, thus indicating that robbery was the motive of the culprits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit B, to which the second assignment of error refers, is the
permit or license to possess said pistol.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibit B was identified and marked during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not available, however, to the public
prosecutor when he made a formal offer of his exhibits, immediately before
closing his evidence, inasmuch as said document was in the possession of the
private prosecutor, who happened to be absent at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, Exhibit B is not indispensable
to find that <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> had the pistol in his
possession and that it was taken away from his person by <span class="SpellE">Tago</span>
<span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, imme­diately after the latter had killed him,
said fact having been duly established by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Capilitan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, such testi­mony was partly
corroborated by that of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, former
manager of the <st1:place>Southern Plantation</st1:place>, in whose favor a
permit had been issued to possess a .45 caliber pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was, accord­ing to <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, turned over by him to <span class="SpellE">Lamberto's</span>
father, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Mendoza, who succeeded him (<span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>) as manager of the <st1:place>Southern Plantation</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, thus, quite probable that <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> took the pistol from his father before proceeding
to the place of the occurrence, in the morning of <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1965</st1:date>, for his (<span class="SpellE">Lamberto's</span>)
protection while plowing the land with a tractor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, it has been proven, by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Capi­litan</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> had in
his possession a pistol at the time of the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether he had a permit or not to possess the
firearm, the taking thereof by <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, after killing <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>,
constituted the crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, too, there is positive evidence to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> had, also, taken a
wrist watch from the body of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Mendoza, which
- in the light of the attending circumstances and independently of said pis­tol
- suffices to establish the motive of the culprits, there being no animosity
between them and the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the last assignment of error, it appears that the
decision of the lower court was promulgated on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two (2) days later, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="10">October
 2, 1967</st1:date>, counsel for appellants filed their notice of appeal from
said decision, after serving copy thereof, on the same date, to the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1967</st1:date>, the defendants filed a motion
for reconsideration of the aforementioned decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1967</st1:date>, upon the ground
that the lower court had no jurisdiction to entertain it, owing to the
perfection of defendants' appeal prior thereto by the filing of their
aforementioned notice of appeal, in view of which His Honor, the trial Judge,
ordered that the records be forwarded to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action is in accordance with sections 3
and 6 of Rule 122 of the Rules of Court and our jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, we have held that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As
a matter of principle, when an appeal has been perfected from a judgment in a
criminal case, the court from which the appeal is made loses jurisdiction over
the case, and this (case) means both the record and the person of the
accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner
that after the judgment has become final, the trial court loses jurisdiction to
amend the same, so also upon the perfection of the appeal which brings about
the finality of the judgment or order of the court, the sentencing court must
also lose jurisdiction or power to do anything or any matter in relation to the
person of the accused-appellant."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although courts may allow the withdrawal of an appeal, for the
purpose of allowing the filing of a motion for reconsideration and passing upon
the same, the exercise of such authority is discre­tionary in nature, and the
records do not show that His Honor, the trial Judge, had abused his discretion
or otherwise erred in acting as he did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, appellants' motion for reconsideration does not state that they
were withdrawing their notice of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, We have examined said motion for reconsideration and found
the same to be devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime of robbery with homicide committed by the accused is
punishable - under Article 294, 1st subdivision, of the Revised Penal Code -
with life imprisonment to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court gave appellants the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary
surrender to the authorities - since they offered no resistance when the chief
of police picked them up for investigation, upon orders of Captain <span class="SpellE">Bangcola</span> - and imposed the penalty of life
imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, indeed, is the
proper penalty, pursuant to subdivision (2) of the second paragraph of Article
63 of said Code, even in the absence of said mitigating circumstance, inasmuch
as the punishment pres­cribed by law for the aforementioned offense consists of
two (2) indi­visible penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amount of the indemnity due to the heirs of the deceased should, however, be
increased to twelve thousand pesos (P12,000).<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With this modification, the decision appealed from should be, as
it is hereby affirmed, therefore, in all other respects, with costs against the
appellants.</p>
