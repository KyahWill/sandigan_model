				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This case was initiated
twenty years ago, on November </span>8, 1948, when Pedro B. Cruz presented <span style="">a </span>claim for P10,000.00, <span style="">evidenced by two promissory notes, in Special
Proceedings No. 5990-R of the Court of First Instance of Manila for the settle­ment
of the estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then administrator of the estate filed
his answer on November 29, 1948, alleging that "said claim was already the
object <span style="">of an </span>action before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, entitled 'Pedro B.
Cruz, v. <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> Rivera,' which <span class="GramE">was</span>
presumably dismissed upon petition of the plaintiff, herein claimant," and
praying that the claim be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Except for several postponements of hearing in 1952, it </span>seems
that <span style="">no action was taken on the claim
until </span><st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="9"><span style="">September 5, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> when the present <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> filed a motion
to set the same anew for hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="12"><span style="">December
 5, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> moved to dismiss the claim on the ground </span>that
it <span style="">was </span>barred
by prior judgment and by <span style="">negligence </span>or
<span class="SpellE">laches</span>, but the probate court sustained the
opposition of the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> moved to reconsider the order of denial, but
was again turned <span style="">down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view </span>thereof, <span style="">she filed an </span>amended answer with
special-defenses, set-offs and counter-claims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The probate court admitted the amended answer but dismissed the
counterclaims.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an order dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="6"><span style="">June 20,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the hearing of
the claim before the commissioner designated for that purpose was postponed to </span><st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> on motion of
the claimant without objection on the part of the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="7"><span style="">July 11, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> the claimant moved again for the
postponement of the hearing to either July 31 or </span><st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="8"><span style="">August 1, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
an </span>order dated July 17, 1961 the motion <span style="">was </span>granted and the hearing was
rescheduled for August 1, 1961, at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, but on said
date neither claimant nor her counsel appeared when the claim was called for
hearing be­fore the commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the probate court in an order-issued on the same day
dismissed the claim on motion of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">administratrix</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 18, 1961 the
claimant filed a verified petition for relief from the order of dismissal on
the ground that her failure or that of her counsel to attend the hearing on
August 1, 1961 was "due to accident, mistake and/or excusable negligence
as shown by the affidavit of Raul La Madrid", which was attached to the
petition, and "induced by undersigned’s (counsel's) anxiety upon knowing
around the end of July that his wife must have to undergo Caesarean section on
3 August 1961, making undersigned (counsel) completely forget to make a detailed
check of his trial dates </span><span style="">before going to <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> to attend </span><span style="">the hearing, x <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">on 31 July 1961 x <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">In his affidavit La Madrid, a steno</span><span style="">grapher in </span><span style="">counsel's</span><span style=""> law</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">office, alleged that upon
receipt on July 21, 1961 of the order of postponement dated July 17, 1961, and
before going on an urgent errand, he placed the </span><span style="">order in the folder for incoming papers and
it was mixed </span><span style="">with other incoming
papers of the office; that he was not able to refer immediately the order to
the lawyer in charge of the case, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Armovit</span>, because the latter was then attending a court
hearing; that </span><span style="">a few </span><span style="">days thereafter,
he found the order in another folder and believing </span><span style="">that it had already
been brought to the attention </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Armovit</span>, he filed it in its proper folder without calling </span><span style="">the attention of said counsel to it; and that
it was not until late in the afternoon of August 1, 1961 that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Armovit</span> noticed for the first time that the hearing on the
claim was set for August 1, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also
attached to the petition was an affidavit of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Albea</span>,
alleging in effect that the claimant had </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">good and substantial cause of action against the estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an order dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="10"><span style="">October
 11, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
probate </span>court denied the petition for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon the claimant went to the appellate
court on appeal from the orders of <span style="">August </span><span style="">1 </span><span style="">and October 11,
1961, respectively, alleging that the lower court erred in denying her petition
for relief from the order of dismissal notwithstanding (1) the satisfactory and
reasonable explanation for such non-appearance, based on the ground of accident
mistake and/or excusable negligence; and (2) the affidavit of merits amply
corroborated by the <span class="SpellE">administratrix’s</span> admission of the
<span class="SpellE">genuiness</span> of the promissory notes on which claim was
based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was subsequently
certified to this Court for final determination because no question of fact is
involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
first assignment of error is totally devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanation offered by appellant for her
failure and that of her counsel to attend the hearing on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="8"><span style="">August </span><span style="">1, </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, as stated in the affidavit of counsel's
stenographer, is neither credible nor constitutive of "accident, mistake
and/or excusable negligence." It is the duty of counsel to adopt and
strictly maintain a system that efficiently takes into account all court
notices sent to him and for want of diligent supervision the inexcusable
negligence of his clerk is imputable to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In at least two
cases, </span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court has
held that such kind of excuse as has been presented here is "the </span><span style="">most </span><span style="">hackneyed and
habitual subterfuge employed by litigants who fail to observe the procedural
requirements prescribed by the Rules of Court."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither
does the alleged forgetfulness of counsel to make a detailed check of his trial
dates due to anxiety constitute "accident, mistake or excusable
negligence." In one case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we held that mere
forgetfulness of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">party to an action is not sufficient ground for
vacating or set</span><span style="">ting aside a
judgment by default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that
counsel's stenographer failed to bring to his attention the order of July 17,
1961 and that he was suffering from anxiety about </span><span style="">the end of July,
ordinary prudence demanded that he should have checked at least before the
scheduled hearing on July 25, 1961 what action had been taken on his motion
seeking postponement of said hearing to either July 31 or August </span><span style="">1, </span><span style="">1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But evidently he did not make a follow-up of the said motion, such that
if the court had denied it, he would not </span><span style="">have been present anyway at the hearing
scheduled for July 25 and the claim would have been dismissed even then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if he were really suffering from
anxiety as he alleged, it is strange that he was able to go as far as <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
to attend a hearing there an July 31, 1961, leaving his wife who was supposed
to undergo a Caesarian operation on August 3, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the inexcusable negligence of </span><span style="">counsel, </span><span style="">his client has to
bear the adverse consequences."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
