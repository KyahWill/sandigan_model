alleging pertinently that:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent took his oath as Judge of the Court of First
Instance of La­guna and <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
with station at <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court, being one of the 112 newly created CFI branches, had to be
orga­nized from scratch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After consulta­tions
with the officials of the province of Laguna, the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> and the Department of Just­ice, respondent decided
to accept the offer of the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> Municipal
Government to supply the space for the courtroom and offices of the court; to
utilize the financial as­sistance promised by the <span style="">Laguna pro­vincial </span>government for the purchase of the necessary
supplies and mate­rials; and to rely on the national government for the
equipment needed by the court (Under Section 190 of the Revised Administrative
Code, all these items must be furnished by the provincial government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provincial officials of Laguna, however,
informed the respondent that the province was not in a position to do so).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the space requirements of the court, the Municipal
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Ca­lamba</span> assured the respondent that the
court could be accommodated in the west wing of the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>
municipal building as soon as the office of the municipal treasurer and his
personnel are transferred to another location.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the projected transfer of the municipal treasurer's office was about
to be <span class="GramE">effected</span>, the treasurer and several municipal
councilors objected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal mayor
then requested the respondent to look over some of the office spaces for rent
in <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, with the commitment that the municipal
government will shoulder the payment of the rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's first choice was the second
floor of the Republic Bank branch in <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, but the
nego­tiations <span style="">failed when the owner of
the </span>building refused to reduce the rent to P300 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next suitable space selected by respondent
was the second floor of the Laguna Development Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a month's negotiations, the
municipality finally signed a lease agreement with the owner on <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="10">Oc­tober 26, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another month passed before the municipal
government could release the amount necessary for the improvements to convert
the space that was rented, which was a big hall with­out partitions, into a
courtroom and offices for the personnel of the court and for the assistant
provincial fis­cal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, upon
respondent's <span style="">representations, the
provincial govern­</span>ment appropriated the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span>
for the purchase of the supplies and materials needed by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early in December, 1970 respondent also
placed his order for the necessary equipment with the Property Officer of the Department
of Justice but, unfor<span style="">tunately, the
appropriation for the equipment of courts <span style="">of </span>first in­stance was released only on December 23, 1970 and
the procurement of the equipment chargeable against this allotment is still
under way (please see enclosed certification of the Financial Officer of the De­partment
of Justice marked Annex 'A').<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"When respondent realized that it would be sometime before he
could actually preside over his court, he applied for an extended leave (during
the 16 years he had worked in the De­partment of Justice, respondent had, due
to pressure of duties, never gone on extended leave, resulting in his
forfeiting all the leave benefits he had earned beyond the maximum ten months
allowed by the law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sec­retary of
Justice, however, prevailed upon respondent to forego his leave and instead to
assist him, without be­ing extended a formal detail, whenever respondent was
not busy attending to the needs of his court.</blockquote>

Have No Basis</span></u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;"> -</span></p>

<blockquote>"Complainant has charged respondent with dishonesty, violation
of his oath of office, grave incompetence and violation of Sections 5, 55 and
58 of the Judiciary Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is respectfully submitted that -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's inability to perform his judicial
duties un­der the circumstances mentioned above does not constitute incom­petence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent was, like every lawyer who gets
his first appointment to the bench, eager to assume his judicial duties and rid
himself of the stigma of being 'a judge without a <span class="SpellE">sala</span>',
but forces and circumstances be­yond his control prevented him from discharging
his judicial duties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's collection of sa­laries as judge
does not constitute dishonesty because aside from the time, effort and money he
spent in organizing the CFI at <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, he worked in
the Department of Justice (please see enclosed certification of <span style="">Undersecretary of Justice Guillermo S. Santos
marked Annex 'B').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, even if
respondent did no more than </span>exert efforts to organize his court, he
could, as other judges have done, have collected his salaries as judge without
being guilty of dishonesty.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Incidentally, when respondent took his oath <span style="">as </span>CFI
judge which po­sition then carried a salary of P19,000 per annum, he
automatically ceased to be Chief of the Technical Staff of the Department of
Justice and Member of the Board of Pardons and Parole, positions from which he
was receiving P16,200 and P8,000 per annum, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, in anti­cipation of the judicial duties
which he was about to assume, respondent took a leave of absence <span style="">from his professorial lecturer's du­ties in
the U.P. College of Law where he was receiving approximately P600 a month.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sections
5, 55 and 58 of the Judiciary Act and Circular No. 10 </span>dated <st1:date year="1952" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1952</st1:date> of the Depart­ment of
Justice are not applicable to a Judge not actually discharging his judicial
duties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Department of Justice has never required judges who <span style="">have not actually </span>started to perform
their judicial du­ties to comply with the abovementioned statutory provisions and
circular (please see enclosed certification of Judge <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span>
D. <span class="SpellE">Pichay</span>, Judicial Su­perintendent, marked <span style="">Annex 'C').<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, a reading of these sec­tions and circular makes
evident the folly of requiring a judge who has not entered into the performance
of his judicial duties to comply with them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taking Section 5, how could a judge who has not started to discharge his
judicial duties certify that 'all special proceedings, applica­tions,
petitions, motions, and all civil and criminal cases which have been under
submission for decision or determination for a period of ninety days or more
have been deter­mined and decided on or before the date of making the
certificate.' And how could such a judge hold court in his place of permanent
sta­tion as required by Section 55; observe the hours of daily sessions of the
court as prescribed by Section 58; and render the reports required by Circular
No. 10 when his court is not yet in physical existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clear­ly, therefore, Sections 5, 55 and 58 of
the Judiciary Act and Circular No. 10 cannot apply to such a judge."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the nature of the allegations of com­plainant and
respondent in their respective complaint and answer and considering, in the
light thereof, that <span style="">the material </span>facts
are more or less undisputed, the <span style="">Court
feels that this case can be disposed of without </span>any <span style="">further proceeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After mature study and deliberation, the Court <span style="">is </span><span style="">convinced that the complaint must be
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To </span>begin with, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> cannot </span>discern <span style="">any tinge of dishonesty </span>in the actuations
<span style="">of the respondent complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span class="GramE">We</span> see it,
the situation is not exactly as complain<span style="">ant
has attempted to portray it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant's theory </span><span style="">is
that respondent collected or received salaries as </span><span style="">judge when in fact </span><span style="">he has never acted as such, since the date he
took his oath up to the filing of the com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the sense that respondent has not yet per­</span><span style="">formed any judicial function, it may be
admitted </span><span style="">that respondent has not
really performed the duties of judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is lost sight of, however, </span><span style="">is that after taking his oath and formally assuming his position as
judge, </span><span style="">respondent had </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">perfect right to earn the salary of a judge
even in the extreme supposition that he did not perform any judicial function
for </span><span style="">he could, while pre</span><span style="">paring himself for his new job or for any
good reason, </span>take a leave, as in fact, he had planned to do, were it not
for the request of the Secretary of Justice for him to forego the idea and,
instead, help the Department in whatever way possible which would not, it must
be presumed, impair his position as <span style="">a </span>judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is more so, when, as in this case, the government offices or offi­cers
in duty bound to furnish him the necessary place and facilities for his court
and the performance of his functions have failed to provide him therewith
without any fault on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
respondent took it upon himself to personally work for early action on the part
of the corresponding officials in this direction and, in his spare time, made <span class="GramE">himself</span> available to the Department of Justice to assist the
Secretary, what with his vast experience, having worked therein for sixteen
years, is, far from being dishonesty, to his credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, it was certainly not im­proper
that he rendered some kind of service to the go­vernment, since he was
receiving salaries, while being unable to perform his regular duties as judge
without any fault on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to
whether or not in doing so he placed in jeopardy the independence of the
judiciary and failed to act according to the correct norm of conduct which a
judge should observe <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> ser­vice to the other
departments of the government will be discussed anon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, the only point <span class="GramE">We</span> settle is that complainant's theory of dishonesty can­not
hold water.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly respondent has not prepared and sub­mitted any of the
reports of accomplishments and sta­tus of cases in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
which are usually required of judges under existing laws <span style="">as </span>well as
the correspond­ing circulars of the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rea­son is simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not yet started performing any
judicial functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of those laws
and circulars <span class="GramE">apply</span> to him, for all of them
contemplate judges who are actually holding trials and hearings and making de­cisions
and orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
respondent could not be blamed for taking his oath as he did, for he had a
valid confirmed appointment in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, he simply made himself available for the purposes for
which he was appointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he could
not actually hold office in the court to which he was appointed was not of his
making.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other officials in charge of
providing him therewith seem to have been caught unprepared and have not had
enough time to have it ready.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conceivably, under the law, with the permis­sion of this Court, respondent
could have been assigned to another court pending all these preparations, but
that is something within the initiative and control of the Secretary of Justice
and not of the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, none of these is to be taken as mean­ing that this
Court looks with favor at the practice of long standing, to be sure, of judges
being detailed in the Department of Justice to assist the Secretary even if it
were only in connection with his work of exercising administrative authority
over the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The line between what a
judge may do and what he may not do in collaborating or working with other
offices or officers under the other great departments of the government must
always be kept clear and jealously observed, lest the principle of separation
of powers on which our government rests by mandate of the people thru the
Constitution be gradually eroded by practices purportedly motivated by good
intentions in the inter­est of the public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fundamental advantages and the necessity
of the independence of said three departments from each other, limited only by
the spe­cific constitutional precepts on check and balance between and among
them, have long been acknowledged as more paramount than the serving of any
temporary or passing governmental conveniences or exigencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus of grave importance to the
judiciary under our present constitutional scheme of government that no judge
of even the lowest court in this Republic should place himself in <span style="">a </span>position
where his actuations on matters submitted to him for action or resolution would
be subject to review and prior approval and, worst still, reversal, before they
can have legal ef­fect, by any authority other than the Court of Appeals or
this Supreme Courts, as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, this Court feels very strongly that it is best that
this practice is discontinued.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the herein administrative complaint is hereby
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let <span style="">a </span>copy of this resolution be
furnished the Secretary of Justice.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I join the rest of my brethren in yielding concurrence to the
ably-written opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge clearly should be exculpated
of the charge filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
more the opinion of the Court possesses the merit of setting forth in
forthright and unequivocal language the disapproval of the practice hitherto
followed of having members of the judiciary perform non-judicial
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt to my mind
of its repugnancy to the fundamental concept of separation of powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to that aspect of the question as well
as what, to my mind, is the doubtful constitutionality of allowing the
Secretary of Justice to exercise supervisory authority over lower court judges
that this brief concurring opinion addresses itself.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of
separation of powers, a basic concept under our Constitution,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
embodies the principle of a tripartite division of governmental authority
entrusted to Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court as well as such
inferior courts as may be created by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three departments of government are thus provided for, the legislative
vested with the lawmaking function, the executive with the enforcement of what
has been thus enacted, and the judiciary with the administration of justice,
deciding cases according to law.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for such a doctrine is to assure liberty, no one branch being
enabled to arrogate unto itself the whole power to govern and thus in a
position to impose its un­fettered will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it were so, the rights of the individual could with impunity be
disregarded; he could be placed at its mercy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The three departments are coordinate and coequal, each <span style="">having exclusive cognizance of matters within
its jurisdiction </span>and supreme in its own sphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to guarantee independence, no
interference being allowed on matters left to the exclusive concern of
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less is control by only one
of the three departments of any or both of the others permissible.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that the realities of government preclude
the independence of each of the departments from the other being absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so especially as between the
legislative and executive departments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the former enacts, the latter implements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase <st1:place>Roosevelt</st1:place>,
the letter of the Constitution requires a separation, but the impulse of a
common purpose compels cooperation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
could be carried to the extent of such powers being blended, without undue
danger to liberty as proved by countries having the parliamentary forms of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is especially so in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Switzerland</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
where the tradition of freedom possesses strength and durability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not admit of doubt, however, that of
the three branches, the judiciary is entrusted with a function the most sensitive
and delicate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It passes upon
controversies and disputes not only between citizens but between citizens and
government, the limits of whose authority must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a system like ours, every exercise of
govern­mental competence, whether coming from the President or from the lowest
official, may be challenged in court in an appropriate legal proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an aspect of the theory of checks and
balance likewise provided for in the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is thus indispensable that judicial independence should, by all means, be
made secure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling that judges are not in any way
subject to the influence of the executive and legislative branches must be
pervasive; otherwise, there would be loss of confidence in the administration
of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With that gone, the rule of
law is placed in dire peril.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor is the force, to my
mind, of the preceding observation blunted by the recognition that there could
be no precise delineation of the respective competence allotted to the legislative,
the executive and the judicial departments under the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, overlapping and interlacing of
functions could not entirely be avoided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For as observed by Justice Holmes in his famous dissent in a case of
Philippine origin:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "The great ordinances of the
Constitution do not establish and divide fields of black and white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the more specific of them are found to

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the doctrine of
separation of powers is a relative theory not to be enforced with pedantic
rigor, the practical demands of government precluding its doctrinaire
application, it cannot justify a member of the judiciary being required to assume
a position or perform a duty non-judicial in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is implicit in the principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise there is a plain departure from its
command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essence of the trust
reposed in him is to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a
higher court, as was emphasized by Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
can pass on his actuation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not a
subordinate of an executive or legislative official, however eminent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indispensable that there be no
exception to the rigidity of such a norm if he is, as expected, to be confined
to the task of adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fidelity to
his sworn responsibility no less than the maintenance of respect for the
judiciary can be satisfied with nothing less.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is apposite to quote from an opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, as Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
when that Court nullified a section of a <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
statute that would vest in a justice of its Supreme Court the power to
investigate at the instance of its governor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His opinion explained why:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"He is made the delegate of the Governor in aid of an executive act,
the removal of a public officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *
At the word of command he is to give over the work of judging, and set himself
to other work, the work of probing and advising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His findings when made will have none of the
authority of a judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To borrow Bacon's
phrase, they will not 'give the rule or sentence.' They will not be preliminary
or ancillary to any rule or sentence to be pronounced by the judiciary in any
of its branches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They will be mere
advice to the Governor, who may adopt them, or modify them, or reject them
altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the beginnings of our
history, the principle has been enforced that there is no inherent power in
Executive or Legislature to charge the judiciary with administrative functions
except when reasonably incidental to the fulfillment of judicial duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * The exigencies of government have made
it necessary to relax a merely doctrinaire adherence to a principle so flexible
and practical, so largely a matter of sensible approximation, as that of the
separation of powers. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Elasticity has not
meant that what is of the essence of the judicial function may be destroyed by
turning the power to decide into a pallid opportunity to consult and recommend

<p class="BODY">Our holding today has been foreshadowed in <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1968 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice J.B.L. Reyes,

spirit, it has been held that the Supreme Court of the Philippines and its
members should not <u>and cannot</u> be required to exercise any power or to
perform any trust or to assume any duty not pertaining to or connected with the
administration of judicial functions; and a law requiring the Supreme Court to
arbitrate disputes between public utilities was pronounced void in Manila
Electric Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> Transportation Co. (57 Phil.
600)."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It is clear from the above <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> decision that
even prior to the Constitution, there was a commitment to the principle that a
member of the judiciary cannot be asked to discharge non-judicial
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in Manila Electric Co. v.
<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> Transportation Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
mentioned therein, Justice Malcolm, speaking for this Court, was quite
explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Supreme Court and its members
should not and cannot be required to exercise any power or to perform any trust
or to assume any duty not pertaining to or connected with the administering of
judicial functions."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, as now
decided, respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span> should not be held
in any wise accountable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No taint of bad
faith can be attached to his conduct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What he was required to do was in accordance with the practice
heretofore followed by the Depart­ment of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is, under the statute in force, under the
administrative supervision of its head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor can the good faith of Secretary of Justice <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
Santos be impugned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was done by him
was likewise in accordance with what previous secretaries of justice were
accustomed to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The root of the evil
then is the <span style="">statutory authority of the
Department of Justice over courts of first instance and other inferior courts.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> While a distinction could be made between
the performance of judicial functions which in no way could be interfered with
by the Department and the task of administration which is executive in
character, still the conferment of such competence to a department head, an <u>alter</u>
<u>ego</u> of the President, is, to my mind, not only unwise but of doubtful
constitutionality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in issuing
administrative rules and regulations over matters deemed non-judicial, they may
trench upon the discretion of judges which should be exercised according to
their conscience alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more,
the influence that the Secretary has over them is magnified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is already unavoidable under our scheme of
government that they court his goodwill; their promotion may at times depend on
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this grant of authority, the
assertion of independence becomes even more difficult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus objectionable in principle and
pernicious in operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That certainly
is not the way to reduce to the minimum any participation of the executive in
judicial affairs arising from the power to appoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is, even when the government as the
adverse party in criminal cases, tax suits, and other litigations is in the
right, a favorable decision from the lower courts could be looked upon with
suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judiciary must not only
be independent; it must appear to be so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The presence in the statute books of such power of administrative
oversight then, is, to my mind, anomalous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More specifically, were it not for such power granted the department
head, respondent Judge in this case could not have been called upon to assist
the Secretary of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that the Constitutional Convention is about to meet, it is to be hoped that it
be made clear that the judiciary is to be totally freed from any supervisory
autho­rity of an executive department.</p>
