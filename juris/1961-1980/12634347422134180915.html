				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Automatic review of a decision dated April 13, 1972 of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte finding the accused <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> A. Ramos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of Rape with Homicide and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death, with
the accessories of the law, and ordering him to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>
in the amount of P12,000.00, plus P5,000.00 as moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of the case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="11">November
 21, 1971</st1:date>, Cristina <span class="SpellE">Manglallan</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>, while walking along an isolated road on her way
to the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte to sell vegetables, found the lifeless body of
her eighteen year-old daughter, <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>, lying face up on the ground, with legs spread
apart and clothes torn and bloody.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cristina shouted for help and her husband and two sons, as well as the
Barrio Captain, arrived at the scene.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The police authorities were sent for and the cadaver was first brought
to the town hall, then to the <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span> residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of said cadaver was conducted
by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Aoigan</span>,
Rural Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte, who indicated in his report (Exhibit "C") and later on
testified in open court that the victim sustained a total of five (5) stab
wounds on various parts of the body and two (2) lacerated wounds on the head,
and that the cause of death was shock due to internal hemorrhage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vaginal findings indicated an irregular
perforation of the hymen, 3/4 of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the discovery of the victim's body, an investigation was
conducted by the police authorities of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police were informed of the identities of
persons who were seen near the vicinity of the <span class="SpellE">situs</span>
of the crime, namely Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
looking in vain for these persons in their respective homes, they found them
later that day sleeping in the house of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Ramos
at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Capacuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
they were told to go to the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos escaped from the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were able, however, to pick up <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00</st1:time>
a. m. on <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nestor <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin</span>, a
young man 14 years of age, when investigated by the police revealed that while
he and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos were walking together near the
scene of the crime, appellant Ramos left him to answer a call of nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He heard the screams of a woman coming from
the direction where Ramos went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when
Ramos returned he was excited and breathing very hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He warned him not to reveal where they went
that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin's</span> testimony, appellant <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Ramos was brought in for questioning.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1971</st1:date>,
the appellant gave a statement (Exhibit "A") wherein he admitted
having raped <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>
and later having stabbed and killed her in order to silence her, as she knew
him personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement was
subscribed and sworn to by the appellant before Assistant Fiscal Fernando <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, after
having previously signed the same in the presence of the investigating police
authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1972</st1:date>,
an Information for the crime of Rape with Homicide was filed against the appellant
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Ramos pleaded not guilty of the crime charged, and at the trial of the case,
repudiated his confession (Exhibit "A") on the ground that the same
was signed by him only because he was maltreated and threatened with death by
the police investigators.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered the aforementioned
decision and the case is now before this Court for automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant reiterates his repudiation of Exhibit "A",
alleging that said statement was concocted by the police investigators and that
his signature thereon was affixed by him because he was maltreated and
threatened by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court refused to give credence to this allegation of
the appellant, finding that the confession was actually voluntarily and freely
given and hence admissible in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with the court <i>a</i><i style=""> <span style="">quo</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is on record that the accused underwent an
X-ray examination and physical examination but no indications or signs of
maltreatment were found on his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
Fiscal Fernando <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, before whom the confession
was subscribed and sworn to, testified that when the appellant was brought
before him, he examined his person and found no signs of any physical injuries
whatsoever, except a few scratches on his arms which, according to the
testimony of the accused, were caused by the frantic struggles of the victim to
free herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Fiscal likewise
inquired of him if he freely and voluntarily made the statement, even
translating the questions and answers to him from English to <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> to ensure that he understood the same, and he
answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he
had subscribed to the confession and as he was about to leave, the Fiscal asked
him if he was regretting having given his statement and he gave a negative
reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears undisputed that at the
time appellant was investigated by the police in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1971</st1:date>, there were
several persons present, namely, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Flojo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinio</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nalupta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Flojo</span> declared
that appellant's answers to the questions of the police investigator were
spontaneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his extrajudicial
confession (Exhibit "A"), appellant declared, among others, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you know why the Police Force came to pick
you up in your home?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
do you know about it?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
I know that the Police suspected me to be the one who raped and killed one,
MODESTA BATTULAYAN, of <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibbo</span>,
Bo. of <span class="SpellE">Camguidan</span>, 25-N, <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
did you commit this crime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Last
Saturday evening between the hour of 1730H. to 1800H.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1971</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
did you commit this crime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the <st1:street><st1:address>Barrio Road</st1:address></st1:street> from Bo.
27-E leading to <span class="SpellE">Sibbo</span>, Bo. <span class="SpellE">Camguidan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can
you specifically point that point where you did the dastardly crime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just
a few meters at the top of the grade of the barrio road leading to Bo. <span class="SpellE">Camguidan</span>, on top of the big flat stones found at the
center of said barrio road.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
made you make up your mind to commit that kind of crime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was then in the influence of liquor, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
did you get that liquor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
my house, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you really commit a sexual intercourse with the late deceased, <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
the woman give any resistance when you committed that sexual intercourse?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, she put up a firm resistance that was why there were scratches made, on my
right arm and left hand and also <span class="SpellE">infront</span> above my
breast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
you have committed the sexual intercourse with the late deceased <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span> what else did
you do to her?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
rendered several stab wounds only I am not certain how many injuries inflicted
on her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
stated that you stabbed her several times what weapon did you use?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
single bladed weapon (IMOCO), sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
is the owner of that bladed weapon which you use in stabbing your victim?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
borrowed from Andres <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin</span>, a resident of Bo. <span class="SpellE">Camguidan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
that bladed weapon is shown to you now can you still identify it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Investigator showing to him the subject
knife [IMOCO] about 7-1/2 inches blade) Is this the same knife you used in
stabbing the late <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the time when you were forcing the late <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span> in raping her, aside from putting up a fight
with you what else did she do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
had been screaming for help.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many times did you hear her screamed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
could only recall three times, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
anybody come to her rescue?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
you have satisfied your lust by raping the woman, what prompted you further to
stab or inflict so many fatal wounds on the late <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
wanted to silence her perpetually because of the fact that the deceased knows
me personally.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
you have raped her and inflicted stab wounds on different parts of her body,
what more did you do to her, if any?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
last act I did was to stab her so that the wound on the left of the head was
inflicted ahead of the stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I was able to force her to lay on the ground she still put up a fight so that I
had to pick up a stone nearby and use it to knock her head, and that made her
unconscious.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Showing
to you this stone now in the possession of the police authorities (Investigator
showing the stone to the subject, which stone was found by the Police at the
scene of the crime, or just near the left side of the head of the victim), is
this the same stone you used in knocking the victim on the head?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, this is the same stone used in knocking the victim on the head.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
were you at that particular part of the barrio road at that time and date?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
purpose was to visit one <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cienda</span>
at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Camguidan</span> but because I saw a woman walking
alone we had to purposely follow that lone woman on that barrio road.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
it true that when you saw that lone woman walking on that barrio road on that
late hour of the day you had already made up your mind to commit the heinous
crime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
* *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you left her at the place where you inflicted those wounds on the person of the
late <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Battulayan</span>,
was she already dead at the time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir, but she was still moaning and groaning, sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent from the answers given by the appellant that they
are replete with details that only the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
could have known.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the confession given by the appellant and the
testimony of Nestor <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin</span>, there are other
evidence which points to appellant <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos as the
perpetrator of the heinous crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Scratches on his arms, hands and chest indicate the struggles of the
victim and the resistance she put up in defense of her honor and her life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, We take cognizance of other pieces
of evidence in the possession of the court <i>a</i> <i>quo</i>, in the nature
of <span class="SpellE">autoptic</span> <span class="SpellE">profference</span>,
consisting in a pair of men's briefs (Exhibit "J") and a handkerchief
(Exhibit "K") belonging to the appellant with tell-tale bloody spots
on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, therefore,
committed no error in not giving credence to appellant's claim that this
confession was extracted through force, violence and intimidation for this is
refuted by:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the testimony of the
Assistant Provincial Fiscal before whom the confession was subscribed and sworn
to by appellant; (b) the firm hand with which the signature was written, twice
on the left margin of pages 1 and 2 (Exhibits "A-3", "A-4",
"A-5", "A-6") and at the bottom of page 3 (Exhibits “A-1"
and "A-2); (c) the profusion of details in the confession; and (d) the fact
that some of the details of the confession were confirmed by other
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of law is in
favor of the spontaneity and <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of a
statement given by an accused before police officers, and the confessant
carries the burden of convincing the trial judge that his admissions are
involuntary or untrue.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further contends that aside from the confession of
appellant Ramos, there is not enough <span style="">evidence
to prove that the deceased was actually raped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As correctly found by the
trial court, there are physical facts which prove the commission of the crime
of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the report (Exhibit
"B") of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Aoigan</span>,
Rural Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte, who conducted an autopsy on the body of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Aoigan</span>,
he found "irregular perforation on the hymen of the victim, 3/4 of an inch
in diameter, which perforation of the hymen was still fresh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her dress was stained with blood (Exhibit
"D").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her blouse (Exhibit
"D-1") and her panties were also bloody and torn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her half-slip was torn on several por</span>tions
and ripped from top to bottom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown
by the pictures taken of the victim's body soon after it was found by her
mother (Exhibits "F" and “F-1"), the legs of the victim were
bent at the knees and spread wide apart, a position strongly indicating the
posture of a woman who has been sexually abused.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stated heretofore, the
admission of appellant contained in his confession is further corroborated by
the testimony of Nestor <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin</span>, a boy 14 years old
at the time of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness
testified that on </span><st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="11"><span style="">November 20, 1971</span></st1:date><span style="">, between </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="17"><span style="">5:00</span></st1:time><span style=""> and </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span style="">6:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon, he was at the residence of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos to collect his older brother's wage for
harvesting rice from appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> representing said wage had not yet been segregated,
he announced that he was going home but <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos
asked him to wait so that the two of them can go together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nestor noticed that appellant was drunk and
that he had on his person a small, sharp, pointed bolo (Exhibit "H")
known in the <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> dialect as an "<span class="SpellE">immoco</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
they had walked some seventy (70) meters, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> told
Nestor to wait for him as he was going to move his bowels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> walked
southward and was gone for about forty (40) minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He felt somewhat uneasy waiting for
appellant, especially when he heard a woman scream about three or four times,
coming from the direction of the top of the trail off the barrio road where </span>appellant
went When <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ramos returned, witness noticed that
he looked tired and was gasping for breath.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> warned Nestor that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Whatever you heard, please do not tell
it to anybody but <span style="">if </span>you do I
will kill you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the suggestion
of Ramos, they abandoned their original southward route which have brought them
to the residence of the <span class="SpellE">Aguibitins</span> but instead took a
farther and more roundabout one by going first northward and then proceeding
eastward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of their
journey, appellant told him to go faster so they moved at a faster gait, until
they reached their destination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court
considered the testimony of Nestor <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin</span> to be
credible and convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made the
observation that Nestor had no motive whatsoever to falsify the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found, on the contrary, that the <span class="SpellE">Aguibitins</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Ramoses</span> are
close </span>and intimate friends and that <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> is
even married to a cousin of the <span class="SpellE">Aguibitins</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Casela</span> it was after the appellant was confronted by
Nestor <span class="SpellE">Aguibitin</span> that the latter admitted the
commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court, which had the fullest opportunity to observe the demeanor of this
witness, stated that it was impressed with the "candor and
forthrightness" of Nestor "whose testimony was confirmed in its
details by the evidence of the defense".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a cardinal rule of evidence that an appellate court will not
disturb a trial court's findings as to the credibility of a witness because
such trial court had full opportunity to observe the witness' demeanor on the
stand, which the appellate court does not have.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
We, therefore, hold that the voluntary extrajudicial confession of appellant,
together with the evidence of <i><span style="">corpus
</span><span class="SpellE">delicti</span></i> and the other relevant and
material evidence afore-stated, are sufficient to sustain the finding of guilt
of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant, however,
questions the imposition of the death penalty upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is his position that such a penalty is a
cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are constrained to say that at this
juncture this is but an academic exercise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not a judicial question, but a proper subject of discussion
among behavioral scientists, criminologists and penologists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having found that accused is guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of rape with homicide, this Court
has no alternative but to impose the penalty prescribed by the law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, namely, </span>death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 335, as amended by Republic Act No.
2632 and Republic Act No. 4111, of the Revised Penal Code provides, among
others, that "When by reason or on the occasion of a rape a homicide is
committed, the penalty shall be death (last paragraph).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death is provided as a single, indivisible
penalty and, therefore, neither the court <i>a quo</i> nor this Tribunal has
any discretion with respect to the severity of the penalty to be imposed upon a
person found guilty of rape with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are bound by the mandate <span style="">of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if mitigating
circumstances had attended the commission of the crime (which is not the case
here), the imposition of the indivisible penalty of death would still be called
