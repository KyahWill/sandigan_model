judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in Civil Case No. 410 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Suazo</span>, plaintiff versus
Director of Lands and <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> <span class="SpellE">Buquingo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacarro</span>,
defendant's, <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In said judg­ment plaintiff was declared owner of Lot No. 2987 of the
cadastral survey of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>, PLS-22, <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City, by virtue of a decision of the Cadastral Court
of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> way back on November 17, 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="12">December
 12, 1963</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span>
V. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, who was claiming the same land as purchaser
from the defendant, received a copy of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 11 of the following year, or on
the thirtieth day from receipt of the copy, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
filed by regis­tered mail with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said motion did not
contain a notice of hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1964</st1:date>
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>motu</u></span></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> caused to be served upon all parties
concerned a notice setting the motion for reconsideration for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, January 27, respond­ent <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Suazo</span> moved for the
issuance of a writ of execution of the decision on the ground that it has al­ready
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> since neither the defend­ants
nor the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> perfected an appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for execution and the mo­tion for reconsideration were heard
on February 1 and 8, 1964, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1964</st1:date>
respondent <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Suazo</span>
filed an answer to petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 9 following respondent Judge issued
an order, a copy of which was received by petitioner on March 17, denying the
motion for reconsideration and allowing the issuance of a writ of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of said order
the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> (petitioner herein) filed a notice of
appeal, a cash appeal bond and a record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1964</st1:date>
petitioner moved to reconsider that portion of the order dated March 17 which
allowed the issuance of a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion was denied in an order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed the instant petition for certiorari, alleging
that respondent Judge acted in excess of jurisdic­tion and with grave abuse of
discretion in declaring the decision in Civil Case No. 410 final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>, in disregarding petitioner's motion for
reconsideration, in ordering the issuance of a writ of execution and in denying
petitioner's urgent motion for reconsideration of the order granting the motion
for execution; and praying that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued
restraining the respond­ents Clerk of Court and Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> from proceeding with the execution of the judgment
in Civil Case No. 410, that the orders of respondent Judge dated March 9 and
March 31, 1964 be annulled and that respondent Judge be ordered by mandamus to
consider and approve petitioner's record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1964</st1:date>
We issued the writ of prelimi­nary injunction prayed for, upon petitioner's
postings surety bond in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue decisive of this petition is whether or not
petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
without a notice of hearing, but concerning which a notice was subsequently
caused by the court itself to be served upon all parties concerned, suspended
the period for appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that respondent Judge gravely abused his
discretion in considering the subject motion for reconsideration a mere scrap of
paper, and that "what the law prohibits is not absence of previous notice
but the ab­solute absence thereof and lack of opportunity to be heard,"
citing <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> vs. Tan, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-6108,
</span><st1:date year="1953" day="25" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 25, 1953</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; Duran <span class="SpellE">Embate</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Penolio</span>,
G.R. No.</span> L-4942, <st1:date year="1953" day="23" month="9">September 23,

vs. <span class="SpellE">Matusa</span>, et al., G.R. No. L-10304, <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1957</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases relied upon by petitioner are not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> vs. Tan,
the lower court appointed a co-administrator for the estate without previous
notice of hearing, thereby depriving the other interested parties of the
opportunity to express their objection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court there held that the procedural defect was cured when the
interested parties pre­sented their motion to reconsider the appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the question involved was one of due
process, not the effi­cacy of a motion for reconsideration without a notice of
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Duran <span class="SpellE">Embate</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Penolio</span>, plaintiff's counsel petitioned the clerk
of court to set his motion for contempt for hearing on a certain date, giving notice
thereof by re­gistered nail to defendant's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date set for the hearing of the motion
neither defendant nor his counsel appeared, and the court issued an order
adverse to defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to set
aside the order was seasonably filed by defendant on several grounds, one of
which was that the notice given to him was not sufficient and that a court
order setting the case for hearing should have been previously issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that it was not necessary that
the court itself order the motion to be set for hearing, as a prerequisite <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, because the notice given by the moving party was
sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in Sun Un <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Matusa</span>, et al., the
question revolved on whether the notice of hearing, incor­porated in a motion
to dismiss and addressed to the clerk of court, requesting that said motion be
submitted for the "consideration of the Honorable Court and as soon as
there­after as counsel can be heard", and at the same time certifying that
a copy of the motion had been sent to counsel for the adverse party, was
sufficient compliance with sections 4 and 5 of Rule 26, (now Rule 15) of the
Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court there held
that such notice was a sub­stantial compliance with the requirement of the
Rules, for in virtue of said notice the hearing was actually set by the clerk
of court, of which counsel for the other party was notified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the said case there was a notice of
hearing incorporated in the motion, whereas in the case at bar there was absolutely
no notice at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also cites <span class="SpellE">Inesin</span>, et al.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>, et al., G. R. No. L-13231, <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="2">February 29, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent facts therein are as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the defendants
received copy of the order of dismissal on <st1:date year="1955" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1955</st1:date>, and on October 31 they moved to reconsider
the said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for
reconsideration did not contain a notice of hearing, but on <st1:date year="1956" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1956</st1:date> a motion was
presented asking the clerk of court to set the motion for reconsider­ation for
hearing on December 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was
opposed on the ground that it contained no notice of hearing and therefore
should be considered as a mere scrap of paper, which did not toll the running
of the period for the judg­ment to become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the court reconsidered and set
aside its order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court, in affirming the order of the lower court, stated:</p>

<blockquote>"It is to be noted that the court of first instance holds its
sessions in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, only once a year on
the dates to be fixed by the district judge (sec. 151, Rev. Adm. Code,
superseded by Sec. 54 of Rep. Act No. 296).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the sessions in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> are not continuous
throughout the year, and since it is not shown that, at the time the
respondents herein presented the mo­tion to reconsider the order of dismissal,
the Judge of the Court of First Instance had already set the date for the next
term, the attorney for the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, res­pondent
herein, could not set the motion for hearing, not knowing on what date or in
what month the next yearly session in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> was to
take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the attorney
for the respond­ent could have set the motion for hear­ing, on the first day of
the term, asking the clerk of court to set it for hearing on that date, but the
failure to adopt such a step could not have meant negli­gence or neglect on the
part of the at­torney for the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> for said
attorney had the alternative to set the motion for hearing as soon as the judge
has fixed the following term of the court in that municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the rules, which we have enjoined to be
interpreted liberally, and under the circumstances, we are not prepared to
declare that the said motion, which was accepted by the clerk of <span class="GramE">court</span> was a mere scrap of paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As may be observed, these were special circumstances obtaining in
the case just cited which constituted the basis of the ruling therein, but
which are not present in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly stated by the trial Court, the subject motion for
reconsideration was in fact a motion for new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons relied upon are equivalent to an
assert­ion that the decision was contrary to law, which is a ground for new
trial (Rule 37, Section 1[c]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
applicable rule on the matter, therefore, is Section 2 of Rule 37, construed in
relation to sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 15, which provide that a written notice
of a motion for new trial shall be served by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
on the adverse party, stating the time and place of the hearing thereof, and
that without proof of service of the notice the motion shall not be acted upon
by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These provisions have been
applied in the case of Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Batu</span> Construction Co., et al., G.R. No. L-16636, <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1965</st1:date> and reiterated in
Fulton Insurance Co. vs. Manila Railroad Co., et al., G.R. No. L-24263, <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the notice of hearing caused to be issued by
respondent Judge, it is contended that it cured the defect of lack of notice.
Under the facts of this case, the contention is incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the duty to give such
notice devolves upon the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, not upon the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Fulton Insurance Co. vs.
Manila Railroad Co., et al., supra, it was pointed out categorically that
section 2 of Rule 37 repealed the provision of section 146 of the old Code of
Civil Procedure and the rulings founded thereon, to the effect that the notice
must be served by the court on the adverse party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, even granting that the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> had authority to issue <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> the notice of hearing, such notice
nevertheless did not cure the defect of the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For while the motion was
filed on the thirtieth day from notice of the decision the notice of hearing
was only issued six­teen (16) days thereafter.</span> Considering that a
defective motion for reconsideration does not toll the running of the period
for appeal, the decision in Civil Case No. 410 had already become final when
the notice of hearing was issued by respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of the foregoing considerations</b>, we deem it
unnecessary to consider the other issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> in the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ prayed for is hereby
denied and the preliminary injunction issued in this case is lifted, with costs
against petitioner.</p>
