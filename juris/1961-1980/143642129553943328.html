The counsel for herein petitioners intimated to the court that he did not intend, by his defective notice of hearing, to submit his motion for reconsideration of the decision to the respondent Judge for immediate resolution; that in a conference between 1 and 4 P.M. on June 8, 1970 with the herein petitioners vice governor and provincial board members, he informed said herein petitioners that he filed his motion for reconsideration with the clerk of court with the request that the same be given to the respondent Judge so that it can be acted upon, and that Atty. Orino, a provincial board member, told him to request the clerk of court to set the motion for hearing because the members of the provincial board desire to argue by themselves; and that on that same day, June 8, 1970, he informed the respondent Judge of the said desire of the board members, adding that he did not place the exact date of hearing, for he "had no inkling that his motion will be questioned later" (Annex U, pp. 124-127, t.s.n. of hearing of July 27, 1970 before respondent Judge).</p><p>At the said hearing on July 27, 1970, the respondent Judge admitted that the counsel for herein petitioners so informed him on June 8, 1970 of the desire of the respondents members of the provincial board to be heard by themselves on the motion for reconsideration (p. 127, rec), to which he replied "By all means," believing then "that the motion was in order" (p. 127, rec).</p><p>In an order dated July 29, 1970, respondent Judge denied herein petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the order dated July 17, 1970 (Annex V, pp. 133-136, rec).</p><p>Hence, this petition.</p><p align="center"> I</p><p>With respect to the orders dated November 26, 1969 and December 4, 1969 giving due course to and granting the motion of herein private respondents dated November 3, 1969 for the reconsideration of the order dated September 10, 1969 as well as allowing them to submit additional evidence in Civil Cases Nos. 6591 and 6763, Assistant Provincial Fiscal Amador, as counsel for herein petitioners, is already estopped from questioning its validity for non-compliance with Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 15, by reason of his failure to submit his opposition to the said motion for reconsideration, despite the fact that he was granted by the respondent Judge in an order dated November 26, 1969 five (5) days from receipt thereof within which to submit his opposition. Such failure to contest the aforesaid motion dated November 3, 1969 for the reconsideration of the order dated September 10, 1969 denying the motion of herein private respondents for the re-opening of the two cases constitutes abandonment or waiver of the right on the part of herein petitioners to challenge the validity of the said motion for reconsideration and the consequent order dated December 4, 1969 granting the same, and such want of notice cannot be raised for the first time on appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> nor on certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This abandonment or waiver was emphasized by Assistant Provincial Fiscal Amador in his motion dated June 6, 1970 and filed on June 8, 1970 for the reconsideration of the decision dated April 27, 1970 and in his urgent motion dated July 22, 1970 for the reconsideration of the order of execution dated July 17, 1970, wherein he stated that he did not any more question the legality of the said order because of the desire of petitioners to afford herein private respondents the '"maximum opportunity to prove their cases" (Annexes G &amp; R, pp. 48 &amp; 117, rec). As a matter of fact, at the hearing on July 27, 1970 on the urgent motion dated July 22, 1970 of the Assistant Provincial Fiscal for the reconsideration of the order of execution dated July 17, 1970, the respondent Judge intimated that had Assistant Provincial Fiscal Amador filed an opposition to the motion of herein respondents for the reconsideration of the order dated September 10, 1969 or a motion for reconsideration of the order dated December 4,1969 granting the aforesaid motion for reconsideration of herein private respondents and allowing them to present additional evidence in the two civil cases on the ground of absence of the notice of hearing required by the rules, he (herein respondent Judge) would have corrected his mistake (Annex U, pp. 124, 130. rec.).</p><p>And as herein respondent Judge himself stated, the order dated September 10, 1969 was purely interlocutory as it is not a decision on the merits of the two civil cases, which he <em>motu propio</em> could have rectified at anytime before the actual presentation of additional evidence by herein private respondents.</p><p align="center">II</p><p>We now come to the question whether the order of execution dated July 17, 1970, the order dated July 29, 1970 denying herein petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the said order of execution and the writ of execution dated July 22, 1970 were validly issued. This issue in turn hinges on whether the notice accompanying the motion dated June 6, 1970 and filed on June 8, 1970 for the reconsideration of the decision dated April 27, 1970, complies with the requirements of Section 2 of Rule 37 in relation to Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p><p>We have to sustain the learned respondent Judge, Honorable Ulpiano Sarmiento, who correctly rejected the contention of herein petitioners that the said notice of hearing substantially complies with the aforementioned provisions of the Rules of Court, invoking the cases of Bath, Fulton, Magno, Almacen, and Sebastian, <em><em>supra</em></em>. All these five cases decided in 1965, 1967, 1969 and 1970 and after the effectivity on January 1, 1964 of the Revised Rules of Court, reiterated the rule that the requirements ofSections4,5, and 6 of Rule 15 in relation to Section 2 of Rule 37 of the Revised Rules of Court are mandatory and non-compliance therewith renders any motion as a useless scrap of paper, which does not merit the attention of the court. Said sections reads read thus —&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 2, Rule 37: - Contents of motion for new trial and notice thereof.- The motion shall be made in writing stating the ground or grounds therefor, a <em>written notice of which shall be served by the movant on the adverse party</em>. x x x" (italics supplied).</p><p>"Sec. 4, Rule 15: Notice.-Notice of a motion shall be served by the applicant to all parties concerned, at least three (3) days before the hearing thereof, together with a copy of the motion, and of any affidavits and other papers accompanying it. The court however, for good cause may hear a motion on shorter notice, specially on matters which the court may dispose of on its own motion.&nbsp; </p><p>"Sec. 5, Rule 15: Contents of notice - The notice shall be directed to the parties concerned, and shall state the time and place for the hearing of the motion.&nbsp; </p><p>"Sec. 6, Rule 15: Proof of service, to be filed with motion.- No motion shall be acted upon by the court, without proof of service of the notice thereof, except when the court is satisfied that the rights of the adverse party or parties are not affected."</p></blockquote><p>The pertinent facts in the case of Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Bath Construction and Company<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> where this Court dealt squarely with the effect of lack of notice of hearing of a motion for reconsideration, are as follows: On April 27, 1959, the trial court rendered its decision in favor of plaintiff. Copy of the decision was received by the defendants on <em>May 2, 1959</em>. On May 12, 1959, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration <em>without the requisite notice of time and place of hearing</em>. On May 21, 1959, the trial court issued an order stating that since the said motion contained no notice of the time and place of hearing, "the same cannot even be considered as a motion; it presents no question which the court could decide and the latter acquires no jurisdiction to consider it." On May 30, 1959 (the 29th day from receipt of a copy of the decision), the defendants filed a supplement to their motion for reconsideration <em>with the requisite notice of place and time of hearing</em>. The defect of the defendants' motion for reconsideration dated May 12,1959 having been cured by their subsequent "supplement to their motion for reconsideration" dated May 30, 1959, the trial court acted on the merits of the motion and supplement and denied both in an order dated June 6, 1959. Copy of the order of denial of the motion was received on <em>June 13,1959</em> by the defendants who filed their notice of appeal and appeal bond on June 18, 1959 and their record on appeal on June 25, 1959. Plaintiff then moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it had been filed out of time, alleging that the motion for reconsideration of May 12, 1959 was <em><em>pro forma</em></em> and, therefore, did not interrupt the running of the period for appeal. On July 15, 1959, the trial court sustained the plaintiff's motion stating that such period had expired on June 15, 1959. The defendants appealed the order of dismissal.</p><p>This Court, thru Mr. Justice Querube Makalintal (with Justice Bautista Angelo not taking part and Justice Barrera then on leave), sustained the trial court's order, and pointed out that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The written notice referred to evidently is that prescribed for motions in general by Rule 15, Sections 4 and 5 (formerly Rule 26), which provide that such notice shall state the time and place of hearing and shall be served upon all parties concerned at least three days in advance. And according to Section 6 of the same rule no motion shall be acted upon by the court without proof of such notice. Indeed it has been held that in such a case the motion is nothing but a useless piece of paper (PNB <em><em>vs.</em></em> Donasco, L-18638, Feb. 28, 1963, citing Manakil <em><em>vs.</em></em> Revilla, 42 Phil. 81; Roman Catholic Bishop of Lipa <em><em>vs.</em></em> Municipality of Unisan, 44 Phil. 866; Director of Lands <em><em>vs.</em></em> Sanz, 45 Phil. 117). The reason is obvious, <em>unless the movant sets the time and place of hearing the court would have no way to determine whether that party agrees to or objects to the motion, and if he objects, to hear him on his objection, since the Rules do not fix any period within which he may file his reply or opposition.</em></p><p><em>We are not impressed by the argument that the 'supplement 'filed by the appellants on May 30 should be deemed retroactive as of the date the motion for reconsideration was filed and, therefore, cured the defect therein. To so consider it would be to put a premium on negligence and subject the finality of judgments to the forgetfulness or whims of parties-litigants and their lawyers. This of course would be intolerable in a well-ordered judicial system.</em>&nbsp; </p><p>"Furthermore, in this particular case appellants were or <em>should have been alerted to the fact that their motion for reconsideration of May 12 did not interrupt the period for appeal when they received the court's order of May 21, 1959, wherein i( was stated that what appellants had filed was not even a motion and 'presented no question which the court could decide.' " </em>(pp. 437-438; italics supplied).</p></blockquote><p>Confronted with the same question on lack of notice of hearing, this Court, in the case of Fulton Insurance Co. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Manila Railroad Co.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> declared that the notice required by Section 2 of Rule 37 in relation to Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 <em>is mandatory, and the failure to give the same is fatal. </em>The pertinent facts therein are as follows: On September 30, 1964, the trial court rendered its decision, notice of which was received by the plaintiff on October 7, 1964. On October 12, 1964, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision <em>without setting the same for hearing, which was supplemented however, by a "motion to set," dated November 11, 1964, </em>setting the aforesaid motion for reconsideration for hearing on November 14, 1964. In an order dated November 18,1964, the trial court denied the motion, declaring itself without jurisdiction to pass upon the same after the 30-day period for appeal. Upon a motion for reconsideration of this last order, the trial court, on December 1, 1964, amended its decision of September 30, 1964. Defendants appealed.</p><p>Mr. Justice Eugenio Angeles, speaking for a unanimous COURT, declared the order of December 1, 1964 null and void, and stressed that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The present provision of Section 2, Rule 37 construed in relation to Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court provides that a written notice of a motion for new trial shall be served by the movant on the adverse party stating the time and place of hearing thereof, and the court shall not act upon the motion without proof of such notice. Said provision repealed the provision of Section 146 of the old Code of Civil Procedure and the rulings founded therein, (Soriano <em><em>vs.</em></em> Ramirez, 44 Phil. 519; Ignacio <em><em>vs.</em></em> Sison and Navarro, 56 Phil. 451), to the effect that the notice must be served by the court on the adverse party (Moran, Rules of Court, Vol. n [1963 Ed] p. 212). The notice therein required is now mandatory, and the failure of herein appellee to give notice of the time and place of hearing of the motion it filed in the court below, was indeed fatal to its cause.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>xxx xxx xxx We also cannot subscribe to the contention of herein appellee that the failure to give notice of the time and place of hearing of its motion for reconsideration was cured when it subsequently filed a motion to set it for hearing. The motion for reconsideration that failed to give the requisite notice of hearing, did not toll the running of the period for appeal, and the said reglementary period naturally elapsed. The decision of September 30, 1964 therein sought to be reconsidered, had then become final when the subsequent motion to set the same for hearing was filed on November 11, 1964. x x x." (pp. 981-983).</p></blockquote><p>In the case of Magno <em><em>vs.</em></em> Ortiz, et. al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> this COURT, in resolving the issue as to "whether or not petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed in the court <em><em>a quo</em></em> without a notice of hearing but concerning which a notice was subsequently caused by the court itself to be served upon all parties concerned, suspended the period for appeal," pointed out<em> "that the duty to give such notice devolves upon the movant, not upon the court"</em> and that, as already pointed out in Fulton Insurance Co. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Manila Railroad Co., et al., <em><em>supra</em></em>, Section 2 of Rule 37 repealed the provision of Section 146 of the old Code of Civil Procedure and the rulings founded thereon, to the effect that the notice must be served by the court on the adverse party.</p><p>The pertinent facts of the Magno case are as follows: On <em>October 31,1963</em>, judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff, copy of which was received by intervenor Gualberto V. Magno on <em>December 12, 1963</em>. On <em>January 11, 1964</em>, the thirtieth day from receipt of the copy of the judgment, the intervenor Magno filed by registered mail with the court <em>a quo</em> a motion for reconsideration. The said motion did not contain a notice of hearing. On <em>January 27, 1964</em>, respondent Judge <em><em>motu propio</em></em> caused to be served upon all parties concerned a notice setting the motion for hearing on February 8,1964. On the same day, January 27, respondent Suazo moved for the issuance of a writ of execution of the decision on the ground that it had already become final and executory since neither the defendants nor the intervenor perfected an appeal within the reglementary period. On March 9, 1964, respondent Judge issued an order denying the motion for reconsideration and allowing the issuance of a writ of execution. On March 17,1964, petitioner moved to reconsider that portion of the order dated March 9, which allowed the issuance of a writ of execution. The motion was denied.</p><p>Petitioner, filed a petition for certiorari contending that respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion in considering the subject motion for reconsideration a mere scrap of paper, and that "what the law prohibits is not the absence of previous notice but the absolute absence thereof and lack of opportunity to be heard," citing Borja <em><em>vs.</em></em> Tan, Duran Embate <em><em>vs.</em></em> Penolio and Sun Un Giok <em><em>vs.</em></em> Matusa.</p><p>This COURT, in a unanimous decision again penned by Mr. Justice Querube Makalintal, ruled that the cases relied upon by petitioner are not in point thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"As correctly stated by the trial Court, the subject motion for reconsideration was in fact a motion for new trial. The reasons relied upon are equivalent to an assertion that the decision was contrary to law, which is a ground for new trial (Rule 37, Sec. 1 [c]). The applicable rule on the matter, therefore, is Sec. 2 of Rule 37, construed in relation to Sees. 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15, which provide that a written notice of a motion for new trial shall be served by the movant on the adverse party, stating the time and place of the hearing thereof, and that without proof of service of the notice the motion shall not be acted upon by the court. These provisions have been applied in the case of Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Bath Construction Co., et. al., G.R. No. L-16636, June 24, 1965 and reiterated in Fulton Insurance Co. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Manila Railroad Co., et. al., GR. No. L-24263, November 18, 1967.</p><p>"As regards the notice of hearing caused to be issued by respondent Judge, it is contended that it cured the defect of lack of notice. Under the facts of this case, the contention is incorrect. In the first place, the duty to give such notice devolves upon the movant, not upon the court. In Fulton Insurance Co. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Manila Railroad Co., et. al., <em><em>supra</em></em>, it was pointed put categorically that Sec. 2 of Rule 37 repealed the provision of Sec. 146 of the old Code of Civil Procedure and the rulings founded thereon, to the effect that the notice must be served by the court on the adverse party. Secondly, even granting that the court <em>a quo</em> had authority to issue <em>motu propio</em> the notice of hearing, such notice nevertheless did not cure the defect of the motion for reconsideration. For while the motion was filed on the thirtieth day from notice of the decision the notice of hearing was only issued sixteen (16) days thereafter. Considering that a defective motion for reconsideration does not toll the running of the period for appeal, the decision in Civil Case No. 410 had already become final when the notice of hearing was issued by respondent judge." (pp. 696-697)</p></blockquote><p>In "In the Matter of Proceedings for Disciplinary Action against Atty. Vicente Raul Almacen in G.R. No. L-27654, Antonio H. Calero <em><em>vs.</em></em> Virginia Y. Yaptinchay,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this COURT, thru Mr. Justice Fred Ruiz Castro (with Justice Enrique M. Fernando not taking part), reaffirmed the Bath case, <em><em>supra</em></em>, and pronounced that "the Court of Appeals had fully and correctly considered the dismissal of his appeal in the light of the law and applicable decisions of this Court. Far from straying away from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings,' it traced the procedural lines etched by this Court in a number of decisions." x x x "As a law practitioner who was admitted to the Bar as far back as 1941, Atty. Almacen knew — or ought to have known — that for a motion for reconsideration to stay the running of the period of appeal, the movant must not only serve a copy of the motion upon the adverse party (which he did), but also notify the adverse party of the time and place of hearing (which admittedly he did not)." (p. 575)</p><p>Dealing with a motion for reconsideration without the requisite notice of time and place of hearing, this COURT once more thru Mr. Justice Querube Makalintal (with Justice Antonio Barredo not taking part), in Sebastian <em><em>vs.</em></em> Cabal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> reiterated the rule in the Bath and Fulton cases and held that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The Rules of Court are quite clear. For motions in general, Rule 15, Sees. 4 and 5, provides that notice of a motion shall state the time and place of hearing and shall be served upon all parties concerned at least three days in advance. And according to Sec. 6 of the same Rule, no motion shall be acted upon by the court without proof of such notice. Indeed it has been held that in such a case the motion is nothing but a useless piece of paper. The reason is obvious; unless the movant sets the time and place of hearing the court would have no way to determine whether the adverse party agrees or objects to the motion, and if he objects, to hear him on his objection, since the Rules themselves do not fix any period within which he may file his reply or opposition." (pp. 454-455).</p></blockquote><p>The fact that the abovementioned cases dealt with motions which initially did not contain nor were accompanied by any notice of hearing, while the motion in the case at bar contains a notice of hearing but deficient, does not preclude the application of the rule enunciated in said cases; because the notice of hearing in the present case is fatally defective, for it failed to indicate the place and time of hearing of the motion as required by Section 2 of Rule 37 in relation to Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15, and therefore the same is, as stated by the respondent Judge, "worse than no notice at all."</p><p>The provisions of the aforequoted rules are clear and are couched in simple language, understandable to any college student, even if he is not a student of law. Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 15 require that the notice shall be directed to the parties concerned and shall state the time and place for the hearing of the motion, which notice Shall also be served to all parties concerned at least three (3) days before the hearing thereof, together with a copy of the motion and other supporting documents. Section 4 of Rule 15 does not state that such notice shall be directed to the clerk of court, much less to the judge himself. Neither does it allow that the notice shall be served any time before or on the day of the hearing, for the rule requires that the adverse parties should be served with such notice at least three days before the hearing, to give them an opportunity to contest the motion and be heard thereon. There is no ambiguity nor vagueness in the rules. Failure to give at least three days notice prior to the hearing vitiates the notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p>But as pointed out by the respondent Judge, the notice of hearing was addressed to the clerk of court, not to the adverse parties. It did not set the time and place of hearing. On the contrary, from its tenor it was to be submitted for the immediate resolution of the court, without giving the adverse party at least three (3) days to oppose the motion for reconsideration of the decision.</p><p>Assistant Provincial Fiscal Amador was still following the old form pursuant to Section 146 of the Old Code of Civil Procedure, which directed the Judge to serve the notice of hearing upon the adverse party. This provision has been expressly repealed by Section 2 of Rule 37 of the Revised Rules of Court, as categorically held in the cases of Fulton and Magno, <em><em>supra</em></em>.</p><p>Assistant Provincial Fiscal Amador had still three (3) days within which to cure the very defective notice of hearing from June 8, 1970, when he filed his motion of the reconsideration of the decision until June 11, 1970, when the 30-day period of appeal expired and the decision became final. But he miserably neglected to do so, in spite of the fact that in the afternoon of June 8, 1970, respondent Atty. Nicanor E. Oriflo, a member of the provincial board and one of the herein petitioners, asked him to request the clerk of court to set the motion for hearing because the respondent members of the provincial board desired to argue their motion for reconsideration by themselves, about which desire he himself informed the respondent Judge that same afternoon of June 8, 1970. At the hearing on July 27, 1970 on his urgent motion dated July 22, 1970 for the reconsideration of the order of execution dated July 17, 1970 (Annex U, pp. 124-127, rec), Assistant Provincial Fiscal Amador admitted his negligence in not submitting an appropriate notice of hearing regarding his motion for reconsideration of the decision as required by Section 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 in relation to Section 2 of Rule 37 of the Revised Rules of Court. When he recalled at said hearing on July 27, 1970 that he informed the respondent Judge about the desire of the provincial board members to argue their motion for reconsideration of the decision, respondent Judge replied that his answer to the aforesaid information was "by all means," believing then "that the motion was in order" and that he had no inkling that the motion was defective (Annex U, p. 127, rec).</p><p>Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 were devised against such omission, negligence, forgetfulness or whim of party litigants and their lawyers, which are intolerable in a well-ordered judicial system if the finality of a judgment is abated thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p>Herein petitioners lean heavily on the cases of Un Giok <i>vs.</i> Matusa<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and Inesin, et. al. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Canonoy, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> decided respectively in 1957 and 1960 — long before the effectivity of the Revised Rules of Court on January 1, 1964 — which do not govern, because the facts therein are at variance with those of. the case at bar.</p><p>In the 1957 Matusa case, the notice of hearing addressed to the clerk of court reads thus: "Please submit the foregoing Motion to Dismiss Complaint and Amended Complaint for the proper consideration of the Honorable Court and as soon as thereafter as a counsel can be heard," followed by a certification by the counsel that he had sent a copy of the foregoing motion to plaintiffs counsel on September 9, 1955 "by registered mail as evidenced by registry receipt No. 703 hereto attached, at Sibalom, Antique." The said motion to dismiss was received by the clerk of court, who set it for hearing on September 24, 1955. although the plaintiff averred that he was not notified of said hearing. Counsel for plaintiff did not appear on said date, but, because defendant was not able to present proof of service on the adverse party, the trial court deferred action on the motion to dismiss and issued an order dated September 24,1955 postponing consideration on the same until proof can be shown that counsel for plaintiff had received a copy of said motion to dismiss. Plaintiff Matusa received a copy of said order of postponement, but before counsel for defendant could present the required proof for service, counsel for plaintiff filed a motion to declare the defendant in default which was granted in an order dated October 15, 1955, and, consequently, the trial court received plaintiffs evidence and judgment was rendered thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p>In reversing the order of default and the decision granted by the trial court on the ground that defendant Matusa was deprived of this day in court, We held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"From the aforeqouted sections (referring to Secs. 4 and 5 of Rule 26 of the Rules of Court, now Secs. 4 and 5 of Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Court), it is required that notice of a motion directed to the parties concerned, must be served by the movant stating therein the time and place for the hearing of the said motion. Counsel for defendant in addressing the notice to the Clerk of Court requesting that said motion be submmitted for the consideration of the Honorable Court and as soon as thereafter as counsel can be heard.' and at the same time certifying that he had sent a copy of the motion to the counsel for therein plaintiff, such notice seems to substantially comply with the requirement of Section 5 of Rule 26, for in virtue of said notice, the hearing was actually set by Clerk of Court for September 24, 1955, of which, We can presume, counsel for respondent Hermogenes Matusa was notified. Respondents banked on the ruling liad down in the case of Manakil <em>vs.</em> Revilla. 42 Phil. 81, but the pronouncement therein is based on the provision of Section 6 of the same Rule 26 (Section 6 of Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Court), which reads as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 6. Proof of service, to be filed with motion.— No motion shall be acted upon by the Court, without proof of service of the notice thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>"It was in virtue of this requisite of proof of service that the trial court, in its order of September 24, 1955, deferred action on the motion to dismiss postponing the same indefinitely until counsel for defendant could produce the necessary evidence that adverse party was furnished with copy of said motion, despite the fact the defendant's attorney certified that a copy of said pleading was sent by registry receipt thereof. The case of Makanil <em>vs.</em> Revvilla, <em>supra</em> enuciated that notice of motion is necessary, and, without proof of service thereof, a motion is nothing but a useless piece of paper which the clerk should not receive for filing, but the facts of the case at bar are quite different.</p><p>"But let us grant, for the sake of argument, that the notice in question, as quoted above is defective, for failure to specify the exact date when that motion should be heard. Even so, We believe that the Court in taking cognizance of the motion on the date set for hearing thereof, cured whatever iota of defect such pleading may have had, specially if it taken into account that upon receipt of the motion to dismiss, plaintiff was properly notified of the existence of said pleading. x x x."</p></blockquote><p>As was stated, the deficiency of the notice of hearing in the Matusa case was cured when the clerk of court set the motion for hearing and the court took cognizance of the motion on the date set for hearing thereof by the clerk of court.</p><p>In the 1960 Canonoy case, counsel for the defendants received a copy of the order of dismissal on October 7, 1955, and on October 31, they moved to reconsideration did not contain a notice of hearing, but on December 6, 1956, a motion was presented asking the clerk of court to set the motion for reconsideration for hearing on December 22. The motion was opposed on the ground that it contained no notice of hearing and therefore should be considered as a mere scrap of paper, which did not toll the running of the period for the judgment to become final. Nevertheless, the court reconsidered and set aside its order of dismissal. This Court, in affirming the order of the lower court, stated:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"It is to be noted that the court of first instance holds its sessions in Pagadian, Zamboanga del Sur, only once a year on the dates to be fixed by the district judge (Sec. 151, Rev. Adm. Code, superseded by Sec. 54 Rep Act No. 296). As the session in Pagadian are not continious throughout the year, and since it is not shown that, at the time the respondents herein presented the motion to reconsider the order of dismissal, the Judge of the Court of First Instance had already set the date for the next term, the attorney for the movant, respondent herein, could not set the motion for hearing, not knowing on what date or in what month the next yearly session in Pagadian was to take place. It is true that the attorney for the respondent could have set the motion for hearing, on the first day of the term, asking the clerk of court to set it for hearing on that date, but the failure to adopt such a step could not have meant negligence or neglect on the part of the attorney for the movants for said attorney had the alternative to set the motion for hearing as soon as the judge has fixed the following term of the court in the municipality. Under the rules, which we have enjoined to be interpreted liberally, and under the circumstances, we are not prepared to declare that the said motion, which was accepted by the clerk of court was a mere scrap of paper. x x x." </p></blockquote><p>It is patent in the Canonoy case that the failure on the part of counsel to set the date of hearing of his motion was not due to neglect or negligence on his part, but because he could not do so as he did not know the date or the month when the next yearly session of the court in Pagadian would take place as there was no showing that at the time he filed his motion the court had already fixed the date for the next term.</p><p>It is evident therefore that the circumstances which compelled the court to regard the notice of hearing in the Matusa case as having been remedied or which justified the failure or inability of the counsel in the Canonoy case to fix a date for the hearing of his motion, do not obtain in the instant case. Here, the clerk of court did not set the motion of herein petitioners for reconsideration of the decision for hearing on a definite date, much less did the respondent Judge take cognizance of the said motion for reconsideration. And the respondent Judge holds hearing every business day throughout the year in Naga City, unlike the Judge in the Canonoy case.</p><p>Neither did herein private respondents file an opposition to the aforementioned motion of herein petitioners for the reconsideration of the decision, so as to bring the case at bar within the purview of the doctrine in the case of Macasero <em><em>vs.</em></em> Saguin<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> much less were the merits of the said motion for reconsideration of the decision argued. The hearing and argument were limited to the motion for execution and the motion for the reconsideration of the order granting the motion for execution.</p><p>Withal, the facts in the instant case do not justify a liberal application of the rules.</p><p>To emphasize once more, the directives in Section 2 of Rule 37 and Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Court are as mandatory as they are clear and simple; and non-compliance therewith is fatal to the cause of the movant, because the mere filing of the motion for reconsideration, without the requisite notice of hearing, does not toll the running of the period for appeal. Unless the movant sets the time and place of hearing in the notice and serves the adverse party with the same, the court would have no way to determine whether the party agrees to or objects to the motion, and if he objects, to hear him on his objection, since the rules themselves do not fix any period within which to file his reply or opposition. The rules commanding the movant to serve on the adverse party a written notice of the motion (Section 2, Rule 37) and that the notice of hearing ''shall be directed to the parties concerned, and shall state the time and place for the hearing of the motion" (Section 5, Rule 15), do not provide for any qualifications, much less exceptions. To deviate from the peremptory principle thus uniformly reaffirmed in the latest cases aforecited in, and to exempt from the rigor of the operation of said principle, the case at bar would be one step in the emasculation of the revised rules and would be subversive of the stability of the rules and jurisprudence thereon — all to the consternation of the Bench and Bar and other interested persons as well as the general public who would thereby be subjected to such an irritating uncertainty as to when to render obedience to the rules and when their requirements may be ignored. WE had to draw a line somewhere and WE did when we promulgated on January 1, 1964 the Revised Rules of Court, wherein WE delineated in a language matchless in simplicity and clarity the essential requirements for a valid notice of hearing on any motion, to eliminate all possibilities of equivocation or misunderstanding.</p><p>WE have been so unyielding on this matter that even in the aforementioned case of Manila Surety,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> WE ruled that the filing of the requisite notice of hearing one day before the expiration of the period to appeal, does not retroact to the date of the filing of the motion for reconsideration, which was filed much earlier or just ten days after receipt of the decision. In the Fulton case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> wherein the movant therein filed the requisite notice of hearing five days after the 30-day period for appeal had expired, although the motion for reconsideration itself was filed five (5) days after receipt of the decision. WE maintained the same rule. In the case of Magno,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> again WE reiterated the same principle, even when the trial Judge himself caused to be served upon all the parties a notice of hearing. The movant in the Magno case filed his motion for reconsideration on the thirtieth day from his receipt of the decision without the requisite notice of hearing, which he filed sixteen (16) days after the expiration of the 30-day period for appeal.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the orders dated November 26,1969, December 4, 1969, July 17, 1970, and July 29, 1970 as well as the writ of execution issued on July 22,1970 are hereby affirmed as valid; the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is hereby lifted; and the petition is hereby dismissed, with costs.</p><p><em>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Fernando, Barredo </em>and<em> Villamor, JJ., </em>concur. </p><p><em>Teehankee, J.,</em> in the result. </p><p><em>Ruiz Castro, J.,</em> is on official leave.</p><p><br>&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 60 Phil. 465.&nbsp; <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 50 O.G. 1952.&nbsp; </p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> L-16636, June 24, 1965, 14 SCRA 435, 437-438.<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> L-24263, Nov. 18, 1967, 21 SCRA 975, 981.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> L-22670, Jan. 31, 1969, 26 SCRA 692, 697.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Feb. 18, 1970, 31 SCRA 562, 567.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> L-25699, April 30, 1970, 32 SCRA 453.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 101 Phil. 727.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 93 Phil. 167.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 93 Phil. 782.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Alafriz <em><em>vs.</em></em> Mina, 28 Phil. 141. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> See Duldulao, et. al. <em><em>vs.</em></em> Ramos, L-4615, May 12, 1952, 91 Phil. 261, 263.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> June 24, 1965, 14 SCRA 437.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Nov. 18, 1967, 21 SCRA 975.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Jan. 31, 1969, 26 SCRA 692.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Feb. 18, 1970, 31 SCRA 562.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Apr. 30, 1970, 32 SCRA 453.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> J.M.
