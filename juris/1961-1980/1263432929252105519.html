aside the order of the respondent judge, dated <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1974</st1:date>, denying the petitioners' motions to

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, Aurelio En. <span class="SpellE">Jutba</span>,
and the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Jovencia</span> de Guzman, are husband
and wife. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On August 29, 1974, the
husband filed a complaint against his wife and the petitioner, Federico <span class="SpellE">Recario</span>, for indemnification of damages incurred by him on
account of the therein defendants' adulterous acts, as well as for his share in
the fruits of the conjugal partnership properties during the time when the con<span style="">jugal partnership was administered by his
wife.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The case was docketed therein as Civil Case

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 1 and 2, 1974,
the petitioners filed their respective motions to dismiss the complaint, based
upon similar grounds, that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the plaintiff has no cause of action against
the defendants since the action is a suit between members of the same family
and there is no allegation in the complaint to show that earnest efforts
towards a compromise have been made before the filing of the suit, but that the
same has failed; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the venue is improperly laid considering that
the case involves ownership, possession and administration of real properties
so that any action affecting the same should have been filed in the court of
the province or city where the said properties are found."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1974</st1:date>,
the respondent Judge denied the petitioners' motions to dismiss the complaint
in an order which reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The grounds of the motion to dismiss dated October 2, 1974
filed by Federico <span class="SpellE">Recario</span> as well as those filed by <span class="SpellE">Jovencia</span> de Guzman, dated October 1, 1974, not being
indubitable, but evidentiary, same are hereby denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint filed by the plaintiff
dated <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1974</st1:date>
which has been filed before the answer to the original complaint is
admitted."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thereafter, the respondent judge set the
pre-trial conference of the case for January 5 and 6, 1976.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Whereupon, the petitioners initiated the instant recourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As prayed for, a temporary restraining order
was issued on <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1976</st1:date>,
restraining the respondents from further proceeding with Civil Case No. 3056 of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental and
from enforcing the order dated <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners contend
that the respondent judge abused his discretion in assuming jurisdiction over
the case which is without a cause of action and where venue is wrongfully laid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners argue
that there is no cause of action against them because the action is a suit
between a husband and his wife and there is no allegation in the complaint that
earnest efforts towards a compromise have been made, but that the same have
failed, pursuant to Article 222 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his Amended Complaint, the private respondent stated the following:</p>

</span>In the month of April, 1969, while plaintiff was seriously ill and

(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is apparent <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
that the husband had exerted efforts to meet his wife and even enlisted the
help of the Philippine Constabulary who summoned his wife "for confrontation
and arrangement," but the wife refused to see him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, thus, substantial compliance with
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary that the
plaintiff should expressly use the terms in the statute, i.e., "that earnest
efforts towards a compromise have been made, but that the same have
failed," in his pleadings in order to comply with the requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similar allegations which would convey the
same meaning are sufficient for the purposes of the law.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners also
contend that the venue of the case was improperly laid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners argue that the case is
essentially an action involving real properties which are found in the City of
Manila and in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City so that the case should have
been filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila and <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City where the said properties are located, instead of with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, the province where
the plaintiff resides.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action is purely personal and is for the
recovery of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the
plaintiff therein had mentioned real properties belonging to the conjugal
partnership which are situated in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
he is not asking to be declared the rightful owner or lawful possessor of the
parcels of land mentioned; nor is he asking for its partition, in order to
classify this action as a real action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff therein merely prayed that the defendants be ordered to
pay him the amounts of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) P36,600.00,
which represents his share in the fruits of the conjugal partnership properties
during the time when the conjugal partner<span style="">ship
was administered by his wife because he was sick; (b) P10,000.00, which he
spent in order to restore titles and maintain a case in court for the cancellation
of fake titles; (c) P50,000.00, as moral damages, for "the sleepless
nights, great moral shock and unbearable sorrows and shameful dishonor, great
mental tension, and anguish" as a result of the defendants' adulterous
relationship and breach of fidelity; and (d) P12,000.00, for attorney's fees
and expenses of litigation, plus the costs of suit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">The fact that the plaintiff therein had asked
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the defendant <span class="SpellE">Jovencia</span> de Guzman and/or her agents from selling certain
parcels of land belonging to the conjugal partnership does not make the case a
real action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so doing, the husband
merely sought to exercise his right, under Article 165 of the Civil Code, to
administer the conjugal partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition should be, as it is hereby,
DISMISSED for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
temporary restraining order heretofore issued is hereby lifted and set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the petitioners.</p>
