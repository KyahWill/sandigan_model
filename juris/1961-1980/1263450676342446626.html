				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="4" day="16" year="1959">April 16, 1959</st1:date>,
Flora <span class="SpellE">Quingwa</span> filed before this Court a verified
complaint charging Armando <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, a member of the Bar,
with gross immorality and misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
his answer, the respondent de­nied all the <span style="">material allegations </span>of the complaint, and <span style="">as </span>a special defense averred that the
<span style="">allega­tions </span>therein do not
constitute grounds for dis­barment or suspension under section 25, Rule 127 of
the former Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was referred to the Solicitor General on <st1:date month="6" day="3" year="1958">June 3, 1958</st1:date>, for investigation,
report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearings were
held by the then Solicitor <span style="">Roman <span class="SpellE">Cancino</span>, </span>Jr., during which the com­plainant,
assisted by her counsel, presented evidence both oral and documentary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent, as well as his counsel,
cross-examined the com­plainant's witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent likewise tes­tified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He denied having sexual intercourse with complainant at the Silver Moon
Hotel on <st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1958</st1:date>,
disclaimed the <span style="">handwriting </span>"Mr<span class="GramE">. &amp;</span> Mrs. A. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>" appear­ing
in the hotel register, and disowned Armando <span class="SpellE">Quing­wa</span> <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, Jr. to be his child.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the hearing, the Solicitor general filed a complaint,
formally charging respondent with im­morality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint recites:</p>

<blockquote>"That on <span style="">June </span>1,
1958, at a time when complainant Flora <span class="SpellE">Quingwa</span> and
respondent Armando <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> were engaged to be married,
the said respondent invited the complainant to attend a movie but on their way
the respond­ent told the complainant that they take re­freshment before going
to the Lyric Theater; that they proceeded to the Silver Moon Hotel at R.
Hidalgo, Manila; that while at the res­taurant on the first floor of the said
Silver Moon Hotel, respondent proposed to complain­ant that they go to one of
the rooms upstairs assuring her that 'anyway we are getting married;' that with
reluctance and a feeling of doubt en­gendered by love of respondent and the res­pondent's
promise of marriage, complainant acquiesced, and before they entered the hotel
room respondent registered and signed the re­gistry book as 'Mr. and Mrs. A. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>'; that after registering at the hotel, respondent
shoved complainant inside the room; that as soon as they were inside the room,
someone locked the door from outside and respondent proceeded to the bed and
undressed himself; that complainant begged respondent not to molest her but
respondent insisted, telling her: 'anyway I have promised to marry you'; and
respondent, still noticing the reluctance of complainant to his overtures of
love, again assured complainant that 'you better give up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway I promised that I will marry you';
that thereupon respondent pulled complainant to the bed, removed her <span class="SpellE">pantie</span>, and then placed himself on top of her and held her
hands to keep her flat on the bed; that when respond­ent was already on top of
complainant the latter had no other recourse but to submit to respondent's
demand and two (2) sexual intercourse took place from 3:00 o'clock until 7:00
o'clock that same evening when they left the hotel and proceeded to a birth­day
party together; that after the sexual act with complainant on June 1, 1958, res­pondent
repeatedly proposed to have some more but complainant refused telling that they
had better wait until they were married; that after their said sexual intimacy
on June 1, 1958 and feeling that she was already on the family way, complainant
repeatedly implored respondent to comply with his promise of mar­riage but
respondent refused to comply; that on February 20, 1959, complainant gave birth
to a child.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the acts of the respondent in hav­ing carnal knowledge
with the complainant through a promise of marriage which he did not fulfill and
has refused to fulfill up to the present constitute a conduct which shows that
respondent is devoid of the highest degree of morality and integrity which at
all times is expected of and must be possessed by members of the Philippine
Bar."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Solicitor General asked for the
disbarment of the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of this complaint was served on respondent on <st1:date month="5" day="3" year="1962">May 3, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, he answered the complaint on <st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1962">June 9, 1962</st1:date>, again denying that he
took complainant to the Silver Moon Hotel and that on the promise of marriage,
succeeded twice in having sexual intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, admitted that sometime in June,
1955, he and the <span style="">complainant </span>became
sweethearts until November, 1955, when they broke off, following a
quarrel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> <span style="">in </span></span>July,
1958, to practice law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without stating
in his answer that he had the in­tention of introducing additional evidence,
respondent prayed that the complaint be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was set for hearing in this Court on <st1:date month="7" day="20" year="1962">July 20, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the day of the hearing Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>
E. <span class="SpellE">Gaddi</span> who appeared for the complainant submitted
the case for decision without oral argu­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no <span style="">appearance </span>for the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the failure of respondent to make known in his answer his
intention to present additional evidence in his behalf is deemed a waiver of
the right to present such evidence (Toledo v. Toledo, Adm. Case No. 266, April
27, 1963), the evidence produced before the Soli­citor General in his
investigation, where respondent had <span style="">an </span>opportunity to object to the evidence and
cross-examine the witnesses, may now be considered by this Court, pursuant to
Section 6, Rule 139 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">After reviewing the evidence, we are convinced that the facts are
as stated in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant is an educated woman, having been a public school
teacher for a number of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tes­tified
that respondent took her to the Silver Moon Hotel on <st1:date month="6" day="1" year="1958">June 1, 1958</st1:date>, signing the hotel register as "Mr.
and Mrs. A. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>," and succeeded in having
sexual intercourse with her on the promise of marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">hotel register</span>
of the Silver Moon Hotel (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B-1
and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> B-2) shows that "Mr. &amp; Mrs.
A. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>" arrived at that hotel on <st1:date month="6" day="1" year="1958">June 1, 1958</st1:date> at <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">3:00 P.M.</st1:time> and departed at <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7:00
 P.M.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant <span style="">also </span>testified that she last saw res­pondent on <st1:date month="7" day="5" year="1958">July 5, 1958</st1:date>, when the latter went to <span class="SpellE">Zambo­anga</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she learned that respondent had left for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span style="">she </span>sent
him a telegram sometime in August of that year <span style="">telling him </span>that she was in
trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again she wrote him a letter in
September and another one in October of the same year, telling him that she was
preg­nant and she requested him <span style="">to come.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Receiving </span>no replies from respondent, she went to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in November, 1958, where she met the respondent and asked him to comply with
his promise to marry her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent admitted that he left for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in July, 1958, and that he and complainant met in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zambo­anga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in November, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
complainant sent him a telegram and letters was likewise admitted in
respondent’s letter to the complainant dated <st1:date month="11" day="3" year="1958">November 3, 1958</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E),
which <span style="">was </span>duly identified by
the respond­ent to be his.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainant gave </span>birth
to a baby boy on <st1:date month="2" day="20" year="1959">February 20, 1959</st1:date>,
at the Maternity and Children's Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is supported by a certified true copy of a birth certificate issued
by the Deputy Local <span style="">Civil </span>Registrar
of Manila, and a certificate of admission of complain­ant to the Maternity and
Children's Hospital issued by the <span style="">Medical
</span>records clerk of the hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">To show how intimate the relationship between the respondent and
the complainant was, the latter testi­fied that she gave money to the
respondent whenever he asked from her<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This was corroborated by the testimony
<span style="">of Maria <span class="SpellE">Jaca</span>,
a witness for the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
respondent's letter dated </span><st1:date month="11" day="3" year="1958"><span style="">November </span>3, 1958</st1:date> <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. </span>E) <span class="GramE">shows</span> that he used to ask for money from the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lengthy <span style="">cross-examination
</span>to which complainant was subjected by the respondent himself failed to
dis­credit <span style="">complainant's testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his answer </span>to
the complaint of the Solicitor <span style="">General,
the respondent </span>averred that he and complainant were <span style="">sweethearts up </span>to November, 1955
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that they <span style="">reconciled </span>and were sweethearts in
1958 is established <span style="">by the </span>testimony of <span class="SpellE">Fara</span> Santos, a
witness of the complaint (pp. 12 &amp; 17, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.);
respondent's letter to the <span style="">complainant </span>dated
<st1:date month="11" day="3" year="1958">November 3, 1958</st1:date> <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E); </span><span style="">and respondent's own testimony (pp. 249 &amp;
255, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant submitted to respondent's plea for sexual intercourse
because of respondent's promise of marriage and not because of a desire for
sexual gratification or <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> and mutual passion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">(<u>Cf</u>. </span><span class="SpellE">Tanjanco</span> v. Court of
Appeals, G. R. No.</span> L-18630, <st1:date month="12" day="17" year="1966">December
 17, 1966</st1:date>)</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the requirements for all applicants for ad­mission to the <span style="">Bar is </span>that the applicant must <span style="">produce before the Supreme Court satisfactory
evidence of good moral </span>character (Section 2, Rule 127 of the old Rules <span style="">of Court, now section 2, Rule 138) If that
qualification is a condition precedent to a license or privilege to enter upon
the practice of law, it is essential during the continuance of the practice and
the exercise of the privilege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Royong</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Oblena</span>, Adm. Case No.
376, <span style="">April </span>30, 1963, <span style="">citing In </span>re <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>,
44 Phil. 567) When his integrity is challenged by evidence, it is mot enough
that he denies the charges against him; he must <span style="">meet </span>the issue and overcome the evidence for the <span class="SpellE">relator</span> (Legal and <span style="">Judicial
</span>Ethics, by Malcolm, p. 93) and show proofs that he still maintains the
highest degree of morality and integrity, which at all times is expected of
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Respondent denied </span>that he took complainant to the Silver Moon
Hotel and had sexual intercourse with her on </span><st1:date month="6" day="1" year="1958"><span style="">June 1, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, but he did not present evidence to show
where he was on that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of <u>United States v. <span class="SpellE">Tria</span></u>, 17 Phil. 303,
Justice Moreland, speaking for the Court, said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"An accused person sometimes owes a duty to himself if not to
the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he does not perform that
duty he may not always expect the State to perform it for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he fails to meet the obligation which he
owes to him­self, when to meet it is the easiest of <span style="">easy </span>things, he is hardly indeed if he demand and expect that
same full and wide consideration which the State voluntarily gives to those who
by reasonable effort seek to help themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is particularly so when he not only de­clines to help himself but
actively conceals <span style="">from the State </span>the
very means by which it may assist him."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the special defense raised by the <span style="">respondent in his </span>answer to the
charges of the complain­ant that the <span style="">allegations
</span>in the complaint do not fall under <span style="">any </span>of the grounds for disbarment or
suspension of a mem­ber the Bar <span style="">as </span>enumerated in section 25 of Rule 127 of
the (old) Rules of Court, it is already <span style="">a </span>settled rule that the <span style="">statutory enumeration </span>of the grounds
for disbar­ment or suspension is not to be taken as a limitation on the general
power of courts to suspend or disbar a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The inherent powers <span style="">of the </span>court
over its officers c<span style="">an not be
restricted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Times without number,
our Supreme Court held that an attorney will be removed not only for malpractice
and dishonesty in his profession, but also for gross misconduct, which shows
him to be unfit for the office and unworthy of the privileges which his license
and the law confer upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In re <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, 44 Phil. 567, citing In re Smith [1906] 73 Kan., 743;
<span class="SpellE">Balinon</span> v. de Leon, Adm. Case No. 104, January 28,
1954; 50 O.G. 583; <span class="SpellE">Mortel</span> <span style="">v. <span class="SpellE">Aspiras</span>, </span>Adm. Case No. 145, December
28, 1956, 53 O.G. 627) As a <span style="">matter </span>of
fact, "grossly immoral con­duct" is <span style="">now </span>one of the grounds for suspension
or disbarment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 27, Rule 138,
Rules of Court)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, we are convinced that the respondent has
committed a grossly immoral act and <span style="">has
</span>thus disregarded and violated the fundamental ethics of his
profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is important that
members of this ancient and learned profession of law must con­form themselves
in accordance with the highest standards of morality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in paragraph 29 of the Canons of
Judicial Ethics:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> The lawyer
should aid in guarding the bar against the admission to the profession of
candidates unfit or unqualified because deficient in either moral character or
education<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He
should strive at all times to uphold the honor and to maintain the dignity of
the profession and to improve not only the law but the administration of
justice."</blockquote>
