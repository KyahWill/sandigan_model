				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review seeks the reversal of respondent Auditor General's 
decision, denying the claim of petitioner Rufino O. Abuda for the payment of his 
salary as Justice of the Peace of General MacArthur and Qinapundan, Samar, 
during the period of his suspension.
<p>Since 28 July 1952, petitioner was the Justice of the Peace of General 
MacArthur and Quinapundan, Samar. On said date, he was convicted of the crime of 
libel by the Court of First Instance of Samar and sentenced to pay a fine of 
P200.00. No appeal from this judgment was perfected by him in due time. In an 
administrative order dated 3 November 1952, petitioner was indefinitely 
suspended from office, .effective upon receipt of said notice by him, in view of 
the aforesaid conviction. The order was soon followed by another letter from the 
Office of the President, dated 26 June 1953, asking petitioner to tender his 
resignation from the service aa of the date of his suspension, or otherwise, 
face dismissal. For the same reason, the Court of First Instance of Samar 
suspended petitioner as of 22 June 1953 from the practice of law. This Court, 
however, in its resolution of 23 July 1953, lifted the said order upon the 
ground that "the act or offense of which he was found guilty * * * was not 
sufficient to constitute gross misconduct in the office of an attorney-at-law, 
nor did it involve moral turpitude."</p>
<p>Petitioner filed petitions for reinstatement by the President, and likewise 
sought absolute pardon; but his pleas were either denied or not acted upon.</p>
<p>Finally, on 19 January 1955, petitioner tendered his resignation to the 
President. However, he withdrew the same on 14 February 1955, after he agreed to 
submit to an administrative investigation to be conducted by the Court of First 
Instance of Samar regarding his case.</p>
<p>Finding that the criminal case for libel was insufficient as a ground for 
suspension, Judge Fidel Fernandez of the Court of First Instance of Samar 
recommended petitioner's exoneration from the administrative complaint. Acting 
upon this recommendation, the President, concurring with his Secretary of 
Justice, on March 6, 1956 ordered petitioner's reinstatement, but without right 
to salary during the period of suspension, on the thesis that, although the 
offense committed by petitioner was neither serious nor directly connected with 
his office, still "his conviction somehow reflected on his fitness for the 
position, in view of which he should be punished accordingly" (Adm. Order No. 
182, March 6, 1956).</p>
<p>The question now thus arises whether or not petitioner should be entitled to 
recover his back salaries.</p>
<p>We think not. Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Payment of salary accruing pending suspension</i>.—When the Chief of a 
Bureau or Office suspends a subordinate officer or employee from duty, the 
person suspended shall not receive pay during suspension unless the Department 
Head shall so order; but upon subsequent reinstatement of the suspended person 
or upon his exoneration, if death should render reinstatement impossible, any 
salary so withheld shall be paid, but without prejudice to the application of 
the disciplinary provision of section sis hundred and ninety-five hereof.</p>
<p>In case of a person suspended by the President of the Philippines, no salary 
shall be paid during, suspension unless so provided in the order of suspension; 
but upoh subsequent reinstatement or exoneration of the suspended person, any 
salary so withheld may be paid in whole or in part, <i>at the discretion of the 
officer by whom the suspension was effected."</i> (Italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner's case clearly falls under the second paragraph thereof, wherein 
it is discretionary with the President to order or not the payment of the 
suspended official's salary during the. period of suspension. That discretion 
having been exercised, this Court is without power to substitute its own for it. 
It is clear from the text of Administrative Order No. 182 of President Magsaysay 
that petitioner's reinstatement was not an exoneration, but was ordered because 
the petitioner has been sufficiently punished with his suspension without 
salary.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, Section 35 of Republic Act No. 2260<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> (erroneously cited by petitioner as Section 
35, Act No. 2265) took effect only on 19 June 1959, and cannot have any 
application to this case.</p>
<p>There is, likewise, apparently no merit in petitioner's contention that the 
President, in not giving full effect to Judge Fidel Fernandez's (of the Court of 
First Instance of Samar) report and recommendation for exoneration, encroached 
upon the powers of the judiciary. In the first place, it does not appear that 
Judge Fernandez recommended the payment of petitioner's salary during 
suspension, and in the second place, said judge was acting not as the presiding 
magistrate of his court but as a delegate of the President.</p>
<p>Petitioner's plea for a review of the legality of his suspension is now 
barred by his own laches. Since he was suspended in 1952, petitioner has not 
attempted to question such action by appropriate court suit. It is the 
established trend of our jurisprudence that the general interest demands that 
questions of titte to or tenure of public office should be submitted for 
judicial determination without loss of time, and that delay in instituting 
action is adequate reason for denying relief.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Auditor General appealed from is affirmed, and 
the instant petition for review dismissed. Costs against 
petitioner.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> When the administrative case against 
the officer or employee under preventive suspension is not finally decided by 
the Commission of Civil Service within the period of sixty (60) days after the 
date of suspension of the respondent, the respondent shall be reinstated in the 
service. If the respondent officer or employee is exonerated he shall be 
restored to his position with full pay for the period of his suspension."
