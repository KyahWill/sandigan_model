Court of Appeals in <st1:place><st1:city>CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>.</st1:city>
 <st1:postalcode>36078</st1:postalcode></st1:place>-R promulgated on <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1970</st1:date> reversing the
judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, Branch II, in Civil Case 804, and from the appellate court's resolution
dated <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1971</st1:date> denying
herein petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> was the original owner
of Lot No. 44 situated at <span class="SpellE">Loakan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
as evidenced by Original Certificate of Title No. 3 issued in his name on <st1:date year="1910" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1910</st1:date> by virtue of Free
Patent No. 5 granted to him on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1913 Mateo died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
survived by his widow <span class="SpellE">Ogasia</span> and six children,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Bilad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crispino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Apung</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sianang</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1930 construction of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Loakan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was commenced by the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
a portion of Lot No. 44 was needed for the landing field, the Government
instituted proceedings (Civil Case 338) for its expropriation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purpose, Lot No. 44 <span style="">was subdivided into Lots Nos. 44-A, 44-B,
44-C, 44-D and 44-E.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The portion
expropriated by the Government was Lot No. 44-A. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1933 Special Proceedings Nos. 409 to 413 were filed with the
court for the settlement of the estate of the late Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of his sons, herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>, was appointed
and qualified as judicial administrator of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his capacity as administrator, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> filed on June 20, 1939 a project of partition
wherein he listed as the heirs of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> who
were entitled to inherit the estate, himself and his brothers and sisters, or
the latter's surviving children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently because negotiations were, by that time, under way for the
purchase by the Govern­ment of Lots Nos. 44-B and 44-C for the purpose of
widening the <span class="SpellE">Loakan</span> Airport, the only property listed
by <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> in the project of partition was the
remaining portion of Lot No. 44.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 23, 1939 a deed denominated "Assignment of Right
to Inheritance" was executed by four of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>'
children, namely, <span class="SpellE">Bilad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sianang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crispino</span>, and the
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Apung</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
(also a son of Mateo who died in 1923), namely, <span class="SpellE">Pitag</span>,
Bill, <span class="SpellE">Alson</span>, Eduardo and Juan, assigning to <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> their rights to
inheritance in Lot No. 44.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stated
monetary consideration for the assignment was P1.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the document contains a recital to
the effect that the said lots, "by agreement of all the direct heirs and
heirs by representation of the deceased Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
as expressed and conveyed verbally by him during his lifetime, rightly and
exclusively belong to the particular heir, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>, now and in the past in the exclusive, continuous,
peaceful and notorious possession of the same for more than ten years."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> sold to the Government Lots Nos. 44-B and 44-C and
divided the proceeds of the sale among himself and the other heirs of Mateo.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1940" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1940</st1:date>,
upon joint petition of the heirs of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City issued an
Order in another proceeding - Administrative Case No. 368 - <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
<span class="SpellE">O.C.T</span>. No. 3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant thereto the said title was <span style="">cancelled, and in its place Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2533 was
issued in the joint names of the five children of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
and the children of <span class="SpellE">Apung</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
(representing their deceased father) as co-owners <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span>, or one-sixth share for each child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

deed of "Assignment of Right to Inheritance." Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">T.C.T</span>. No. 2533 in the names of the heirs was cancelled,
and in lieu thereof Transfer Certi­ficate of Title </span>No. <span style="">2540 was issued on the same date in the name
of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also on the same date, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>,
acting as exclusive owner of the land covered by <span class="SpellE">T.C.T</span>.
No. 2540, executed a formal deed of sale in favor of the Government over Lots
Nos. 44-B and 44-C.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 21, 1947, as
a result of the approval of the Subdivision Survey Plan psd-16786, and pursuant
to the deed of sale executed in 1940 by <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> in favor of the Government, <span class="SpellE">T.C.T</span>.
No. 2540 in <span class="SpellE">Maximino’s</span> name was cancelled, and in
lieu thereof Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-98, covering Lots Nos. 44-A,
44-B and 44-C, was issued in the name of the Government, while Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-99, covering the remaining Lots Nos. 44-D (100, 345
square meters) and 44-E (10,070 square meters) was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>, who has up to
the present remained the registered owner of said lots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="4" month="9"><span style="">September
 4, 1958</span></st1:date><span style=""> the present
complaint was filed by three children of the late Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Bilad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crispino</span>, and by some of the surviving heirs of <span class="SpellE">Apung</span> and of <span class="SpellE">Sianang</span> (also
children of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> was named principal defendant, and some of the heirs
of <span class="SpellE">Apung</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sianang</span> were <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as parties-defendants in view of their alleged
reluctance to join as parties-plaintiffs.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their complaint the
plaintiffs alleged <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that they
and/or their predecessors-in-interest executed the deed of "Assignment of
Right to Inheritance" on October 23, 1939, only because they were made to
believe by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
that the said instrument embodied the understanding among the parties that it
merely authorized the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> to convey
portions of Lot </span>No. 44 <span style="">to </span>the
Government in their behalf <span style="">to </span><span style="">minimize expenses and facilitate the
transaction; and that it was only on February 18, 1958, when the plaintiffs
secured a copy of the deed, that they came to know that the same purported to
assign in favor of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> their rights to
inheritance from Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs prayed that the deed of
"Assignment of Right to Inheritance" be declared null and void; that
Lots </span>Nos. <span style="">44-D and 44-E covered
by <span class="SpellE">T.C.T</span>. No. T-99 be ordered partitioned into six
(6) equal shares and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Carantes</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">be
accordingly ordered to execute the necessary deeds of conveyance in favor of
the other <span class="SpellE">distributees</span>; and that the said defendant
be ordered to </span>pay <span style="">the plaintiffs
the sum of P</span><span style="">1,000 </span><span style="">as attorney's fees and the sum of P200 as
costs of suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 10, 1958 the
defendants filed </span>a <span style="">motion to
dismiss on the grounds (1) that the plaintiffs' cause of action is barred by
the statute of limitations because the deed of assignment was recorded in the
Registry of Property at the latest on February 21, 1947, hence, plaintiffs'
cause of action accrued from the said date, and since pursuant to article 1144 </span>of
<span style="">the new Civil Code an action based on a
written contract must be brought within ten years from the time the right of
action accrues, plaintiffs' right to file the complaint had already prescribed
on September 4, 1958; and (2) that the complaint states no cause of action
because ownership over the property became vested in <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> by acquisitive prescription ten years from
its regis­tration in his name on February 21, 1947.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an Order dated </span><st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September
 30, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, the trial
court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that there are allegations of
co-ownership and trust in the complaint, and, therefore, prescrip­tion did not
lie, and that the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs discovered the alleged
fraud only in February, 1958.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer filed on
October 7, 1958, the defendants traversed the material averments of the
complaint and alleged </span><u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">alia</span></u></span><span style=""> that the property of the deceased Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
and his wife had been divided and distributed among their six children; that
the deed of "Assignment of Right to Inherita</span><span style="">nc</span><span style="">e" was an
acknowledgment of the fact of designation of the property therein described as
specifically pertaining or belonging by right of inheritance to the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>; that there was
never any agreement between </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">assignors and the assignee authorizing the
latter to merely represent his co-heirs in negotiations with the Government;
and that the assignors knew fully well that the deed of assign­ment contained
what, on its face, it represented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
way of special defenses, the defendants alleged that any supposed agreement
between the plaintiffs and/or their predecessors-in-interest and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>, other than the
deed of assignment, is barred by the statute of frauds and is null and void
because not in writing, much less, in a public instrument; that the only
agreement between the parties is what appears in the deed of assignment; that
the plaintiffs' right of action has already prescribed; that the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> acquired
absolute ownership over the property in question by acquisitive prescription
and registration; and that any obligation on the part of the defendants in
relation to the property had been discharged by <span class="SpellE">novation</span>,
<span class="SpellE">condonation</span> and compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants set up the counterclaim that
in the event the rights of the heirs are disturbed, the produce from the lands
inherited by the plaintiffs from Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> as
well as the real estate taxes on the land paid by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> should be
collated; and that the filing of the complaint being malicious, the defendants
should be awarded the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,500</span> by way of nominal,
compensatory, moral and corrective damages, including attorney's fees and
expenses of litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants
prayed for the dismissal of the complaint and payment of damages to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An answer to the counterclaim was filed by the plaintiffs on <st1:date year="1958" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1958</st1:date> denying the material
allegations of the counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court rendered its decision on <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="1">January <span style="">28,
 </span>1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the
trial court's opinion <span style="">that since an
action based on fraud prescribes in four years from the discovery of the fraud,
and in this case the fraud allegedly perpetrated by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> must be deemed
to have been discovered on March 16, 1940 when the deed of assignment was
registered, the plaintiffs' right of action had already prescribed when they
filed the action in 1958; and even assuming that the land remained the common
property of the plaintiffs and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> notwithstanding the </span><span style="">execution of the deed of assignment, the
co-ownership was completely repudiated by the said defendant by performance of
several acts, the first of which was his execution of a deed of sale in favor
of the Government on October 23, 1939, hence, ownership had vested in the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
by acquisitive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
accordingly dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
likewise dismissed the counterclaim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The plaintiffs moved for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their motion having
been denied in an Order dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="3"><span style="">March 8, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, they appealed to the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As adverted to above, the
Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial c</span>ourt, <span style="">hence the present recourse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- I -</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In her brief filed with
this Court, the petitioner argues that the private respondents' action is not
actually one for annulment of the deed of "Assignment of Right to
Inheritance" but for the reformation thereof, hence, the said action has
prescribed long before the filing of the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner's theory
that the private respondents' action is for reformation of an instrument is a
new one, adopted by the petitioner for the first time on appeal to this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband did not raise it as a
defense in his answer filed with the trial court, where, consequently, trial
proceeded on the theory that the action sought the declaration of nullity of
the deed of assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case
reached the respondent court the petitioner likewise did not raise this issue,
although in truth, even had she done so, it would have been a belated and
futile exercise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She cannot be allowed
to change her theory of the case at this stage of the proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The settled rule is that
defenses not pleaded in the </span>answer <span style="">may
not be raised for the first time on appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> A party cannot, on appeal, change</span><span style=""> </span>fundamentally the nature of the issue
in the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">When a party deliberately adopts a
certain theory and the case is decided upon that theory in the court below, he
will not be permitted to change the same on appeal, because to permit him to do
so would </span>be unfair to the adverse party.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, we have to
disregard the petitioner's theory that the action is for reformation</span> of
an instrument, and must proceed on the basis of <span style="">the issues properly raised and ventilated before the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- II -</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">do not agree with the respondent court's
legal conclusion that the deed </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">"Assignment of Right to
Inheritance" is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
inexistent on the grounds that real consent was wanting and the consideration
of P1.00 is </span><span style="">so </span><span style="">shocking to the conscience that there was in
fact no consideration, hence, the action for the declaration of the contract's
inexistence </span>does not prescribe pursuant to article 1410 of the new Civil
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1409 (2) of the new Civil Code relied <span style="">upon by the respondent court provides that
contracts "which are absolutely simulated or fictitious" are
inexistent and void from the beginning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basic characteristic of simulation is the fact that the apparent
contract is not really desired or intended to produce legal effects or in any way
alter the juridical situation of the parties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondents' action
may not be considered as one to declare the inexistence of a contract for lack
of consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is total absence of
cause </span><span style="">or consideration that
renders a contract absolutely void and </span>inexistent.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">In the case at bar con­sideration was
not absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>sum <span style="">of P1</span><span style="">.00 </span><span style="">appears in the
document as one of the considerations for the assignment of inheritance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition - and this of great legal import
- the document recites that the decedent Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>
had, during his life­time, expressed to the signatories to the contract that
the property subject-matter thereof rightly and exclusively belonged to the
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This acknowledgment by the signatories
definitely constitutes valuable consideration for the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The present action is one
</span>to <span style="">annul the contract entitled </span>"Assignment
<span style="">of Right to Inheritance" on the
ground of fraud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 1390 of the new
Civil Code provides that a contract "where the consent is vitiated by
mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud," is <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> or annullable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even article 1359, which deals on reformation of instruments, provides
in its paragraph 2 that "If mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct, or
accident has prevented a meeting of the minds of the parties, the proper remedy
is not reformation of the instrument but annulment of the contract." When
the consent to a contract was fraudulently obtained, the contract is <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Fraud or deceit does not render a contract

<p class="BODY">The next question that must be resolved is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from what time must fraud, assuming that
there was fraud, be deemed to have been discovered in the case at bar?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From February, 1958, when, according to the
private respondents, and as found by the respondent <span style="">court, the private respondents actually discovered that they were
defrauded by the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> when rumors spread that he was selling the
property for half a million pesos?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or
from </span><st1:date year="1940" day="16" month="3"><span style="">March 16, 1940</span></st1:date><span style="">,
when, as admitted by the parties and found by both the trial court and the
respondent court, the deed of "Assignment of Right to Inheritance"
was registered by the petitioner in the Office of the Register of Deeds?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The weight of authorities is to the effect that the registration
of an instrument in the Office of the Register <span style="">of </span>Deeds constitutes constructive notice to the whole world,

time of the registration.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case the deed of assignment was registered on <st1:date year="1940" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1940</st1:date>, and in fact on the same date <span class="SpellE">T.C.T</span>. No. 2533 in the names of the heirs of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> was cancelled, and <span class="SpellE">T.C.T</span>.
No. 2540 in the name of the petitioner was issued in lieu thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four-year period within which the private
respondents could have filed the present action consequently commenced on <st1:date year="1940" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1940</st1:date>; and since they filed
it only on <st1:date year="1958" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1958</st1:date>,
it follows that the same is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court refused to accord recognition to the rule of
constructive notice, because, according to it, there was a fiduciary
relationship between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
this premise it concluded that the four-year prescriptive period should be deemed
to have commenced in February, 1958 when private <span style="">respondents </span>had actual notice of the <span style="">fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without resolving the
question of whether or not constructive notice applies when a fiduciary
relationship exists between the parties - a point which is not in issue in this
case - we hold that the respondent court's conclusion, lacking the necessary
premise upon which it should be predicated, is erroneous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Definitely, no express
trust was created in favor of the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If trust there was, it could only be - as
held by respondent court - a constructive trust, which is imposed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In constructive trusts there is neither
promise nor fiduciary relation; the so-called trustee does not recognize </span><span style="">any </span><span style="">trust and has no intent to hold the property for the beneficiary.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In at least two cases, the rule of

judicial orders, this Court held that the recording of the judicial orders
sufficed as notice to the other heirs, for the rule is that knowledge of what
might have been revealed by proper inquiry is imputable to the inquirer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Gerona</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><u><span style="">, et al. vs. De Guzman, et al</span></u><span style="">., <u>supra</u>, the petitioners and the

</span><span style="">deemed to have taken place, in
the case at bar, on June 25, 1948, when said instrument was filed with the

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- IV -</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision under review found that a constructive trust was
created in favor of the private respondents, and, holding that an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> <span class="GramE">based</span> on constructive
trust is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>, recognized the right of the
private respondents to file an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
regardless of the lapse of time, citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Gayandato</u></span><u>
vs. Treasurer of the Philippine </u><st1:place><u>Islands</u></st1:place><u>,

<p class="BODY">We have examined <span class="SpellE"><u>Gayandato</u></span>, and
have failed to find support therein for the holding of the re­spondent
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, it is now settled
that an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> based on implied or
constructive trust is <span class="SpellE">prescriptible</span>; it prescribes in
ten years.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case the ten-year pres­criptive period began on <st1:date year="1940" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1940</st1:date>, when the petitioner registered
the deed of "Assignment of Right to Inheritance" and secured the
cancellation of the certificate of title in the joint names of the heirs of
Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span>, and, in lieu thereof, the issuance of
a new title exclusively in his name.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the present action was commenced only on <st1:date year="1958" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1958</st1:date>, it is clear that the same is barred by
extinctive prescription.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- V -</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also held by the respondent court that the petitioner was
merely holding the property in <span style="">trust for
the benefit of his co-heirs as administrator, hence, there was a continuing and
subsisting trust, and pursuant to section 38 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
the provisions of the said Code on prescription (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
40-41) do not apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our </span>view,
however, that there was no continuing and subsisting trust.</p>

<p class="BODY">From <st1:date year="1940" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1940</st1:date>,
when the petitioner registered the deed of assignment and had the cer­tificate
of title in the names of the heirs cancelled and a new certificate of title
issued in his own name, he began to hold the property in open and clear
repudiation of any trust.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It will be noted that on the same date, the petitioner also executed a formal
deed of sale over portions of Lot No. 44 in favor of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1948 he mortgaged Lot No. 44-D with the
Philippine National Bank as his exclusive property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's exercise of such rights of
dominion is anathema to the concept of a continuing and subsisting trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances, found by the respondent
court, that the name of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Carantes</span> still appeared
in the tax declaration as owner of the land and the name of the petitioner as
administrator, that the real estate taxes were shared by the other heirs with
the petitioner, and <span style="">that some </span>of
the heirs are living in houses erected by them on the land, wane in legal
significance in the face of the petitioner's aforesaid <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
acts of strict dominion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection
with the payment of real estate taxes, it is to be noted that the respondent
court also found that all the receipts were issued in the name of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances mentioned
above do not make out a case of a continuing and subsisting trust.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals appealed
from is set aside, and another entered dismissing the complaint in Civil Case
