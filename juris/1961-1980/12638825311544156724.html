twenty (20) minutes within which to "consummate" his conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, when the session was <span style="">resumed, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villafuerte</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then and there, and

review, the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">dispositive</span></span><span style=""> portion </span><span style="">of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing considerations, the Court declares
the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged in the
information (Art. 294, Par. (1), Revised Penal Code) and in view of the
attendance of the lone mitigating circumstance of voluntary plea of guilty to
the offense charged and the presence of three (3) generic aggravating
circumstances, one of which <span style="">was </span>necessarily offset by the lone mitigating circumstance of
the said voluntary plea of Guilty, as prescribed in Art. 64 of the Revised
Penal Code, the Court is constrained to impose upon each <span style="">of the accused the DEATH PENALTY, with the
other accessories of the law; to proportionately indemnify the heirs of the
victim in the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; to correspondingly
pay the said heirs by way of moral and exemplary damages in</span> <span style="">the amount of P20,000.00,</span> <span style="">proportionately; and similarly, to
proportionately pay the costs of these proceedings ...."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before this COURT, the accused are represented, by duly
designated counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, Atty.
Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the brief he filed on December 6, 1972, counsel
assigned only one error, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The trial court erred in convicting the accused-appellants and
imposing the supreme penalty on the basis alone of their plea of guilty to the
information and the aggravating circumstances alleged therein without the court
ascertaining whether or not there was evidence to support the existence of such
aggravating circumstances", and prayed for "the remand of the case
for further trial in the lower court."</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 28, 1973, Acting Solicitor General Hector G. <span class="SpellE">Fule</span>, Assistant Solicitor General Jaime M. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span> and Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Reynato</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, filed a manifestation, which has been considered as <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief, virtually joining the cause of the
defendants-appellants by enumerating in one page a long chain of cases previously
decided by this COURT, and praying that the decision under review be vacated
and the case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE have painstakingly <span class="GramE">reviewed,</span> the
record of this case and WE find both the lone error assigned by appellants and
the manifestation of the Solicitor General well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, WE set aside the decision of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not even
ascertain for itself whether the accused completely understood the precise
nature of the charge and the meaning of the aggravating circumstances of
nighttime, craft and abuse of superior strength as having attended the
commission of the crime, so as to obviate any doubt as to the possibility that
they have misunderstood the nature and gravity of the charge to which they were
pleading guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court did not
conduct a dialogue with the accused on their educational attainment especially
considering that a cursory perusal of their signatures on the statements they
gave to the <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> Police Force (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
A, B and C) tends to show that they have very little or scanty education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, from the transcript, WE have noted
that after the arraignment, trial was held on three dates and on each day the
accused were assisted by three (3) different counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the hearing of October 7, 1970 - the day the decision under review was rendered
- the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> who assisted
the accused was designated by the trial court only after the case was called
for trial, i.e., after the accused had informed the trial court that they did
not have a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, it is not unreasonable to assume that said counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> proceeded to trial without first fully
investigating the facts of the case and that his interview with the accused,
even if it lasted for twenty (20) minutes as the record insinuates, was not,
and could not have been sufficient to enable him to acquire a fairly good
grasp, much less a com­prehensive knowledge, of the relevant facts of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, under the Rules of
this Court, whenever an attorney <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
is employed or assigned by the court to defend the accused at the trial, he
shall be given a reasonable time to consult with the accused and prepare his
defense before proceeding further in the case, which shall not be less than two
(2) days in case of trial (Sec. 5, Rule 116, Revised, Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record, incidentally, does not show the
existence of a "good cause" to justify the trial court in shortening
the trial fixed by the Rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>cannot plead ignorance of the prevailing injunction directed
towards trial judges to exercise patience and circumspection in explaining to
the accused not only the nature and meaning of the accusation and the full
import of their plea of guilty but also the meaning - in layman's language - of
the aggravating circumstances that attended the commission bf the crime,
because not very long before the rendition of the decision under review, this
COURT in three (3) cases (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>, 24 SCRA
798, August 30, 1968; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span>, 27 SCRA, 1037,
April 25, 1969; and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>, 29 SCRA 61,
August 25, 1969) had already enunciated its long-settled rule on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in the <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span> case, WE had occasion to reiterate the said rule of
practice, recommended since the early cases of US vs. <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span>
(6 Phil. 541, 543, Oct. 29, <span style="">1906) </span>and
US vs. Rota (9 Phil. 426, Dec. 21, 1907), and thereafter set out in Sec. 5,
Rule 118 of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Plea of guilty - Determination of
punishment.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Where the defendant
pleads guilty to a complaint or information, if the court accepts the plea and
has discretion as to the punishment for the offense, it may hear witnesses to
determine what punishment shall be imposed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">did not even consult the
testimonies of the three State witnesses - namely, the doctor and the police
officers who took down the statements of the accused - who testified during the
first and second hearings, at least with the end in view of ascertaining the
degree of the penalty that should be imposed after accepting the plea of guilty
of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">did was only to ask the accused whether they
were ready to receive their sentence after they had affirmed the
"truthfulness and correctness" of their counsel's manifestation on
their change of plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not even inform the accused that their plea of
guilty might mean death for all of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE
deeply lament this attitude of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Be that as it may, however, WE only hope that h</span><span style="">ereafter </span><span style="">trial courts would strictly comply with </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">rigid standard set
in the following cases after </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Apduhan</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span>, all of which
have invariably, consistently and firmly established and stressed the duty of
trial courts before accepting the plea of guilty of an accused to a capital
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Englatera</span> (34
SCRA, 2456, July 31, 1970), where WE found it proper to invite the attention of
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>and
of all trial courts in general to what WE said in <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>
ant <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span> cases on the matter of what the trial
court should do upon arraignment of a defendant charged with a capital offense,
before he is allowed to enter a plea of guilty;</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Estebia</span> (40
SCRA, 90, July 29, 1971), where, in addition to reiterating what WE said in the
<span class="SpellE">Englatera</span> case, WE also stressed on the need for care
and prudence before accepting the plea of guilty of an accused especially in
capital offenses;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The case of People vs. <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> (40 <span style="">SCRA, 230, </span><st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30, </span>1971</st1:date>), where this COURT, speaking through
then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Querube</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The norm that should be allowed where <span style="">a </span>plea of guilty is entered by the defendant, <span style="">especially </span>in cases where the capital
penalty may be <span style="">imposed, is that the
court should be sure that defendant fully </span>understood the nature of the
charges preferred against him and the character of the punishment provided by
law before it is imposed."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">4. The case of People vs.
Simeon (47 SCRA, 129, </span>September 28, 1972), where WE made reference to
numerous other cases, such as US vs. <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span>, <u>supra</u>;
US vs. Rota, et <span style="">al., <u>supra</u>; </span>US
vs. <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span> (31 Phil. <span style="">91, March 31, 1915); People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bulalake</span> (106
Phil. 767, December 28, 1959); and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span>, <u>supra</u>,
not to mention the 1971 and 1972 cases of People vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Estebia</span>,
<u>supra</u>, and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Esteves</span> (L-34811, August
22, 1972);</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> (61
SCRA 468, 473, <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1974</st1:date>),
where this COURT, speaking again through then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Querube</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, said:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"The trial court
disregarded our injunction in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> (24
SCRA, </span>817) to all trial judges to 'refrain from accepting with alacrity
an <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> plea of guilty, for while justice
demands a speedy administration, judges are duty bound to be extra solicitous
in seeing to it that when an accused pleads guilty he <span style="">understands fully the meaning of his plea and the import of an inevitable
conviction.' In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> (55 SCRA, 589),
this Court had occasion to reiterate the rule 'that in capital offenses the
taking of testimony, notwithstanding </span>the <span style="">plea of guilty, is </span>the proper and <span style="">prudent </span>course to follow to establish the guilt and precise
degree of culpability of the accused not only to satisfy the trial judge but to
aid the Supreme Court in determining whether accused really and truly
understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and consequence of <span style="">his </span>plea.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What this Court said in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Busa</span>
(51 SCRA, 317) is particularly apropos:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'In sum and substance, it will not suffice, under the law providing for
compulsory review of death sentences by this Court, that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> plea of guilty is admitted and, on the basis
thereof, that judgment <span style="">is </span>summarily
rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essence of judicial review
in capital offenses is that while society allows violent retribution for
heinous crimes committed against it, it always must make certain that blood of
the innocent is not spilled, or that the guilty are not made to suffer more
than their just measure of punishment and retribution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a judgment meting out penalty of death
is valid only if it <span style="">is </span>susceptible
of a fair and reasonable examination by this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">6. The case of People vs. Domingo (68 SCRA, 50, 54, November 13,
1975), where, aside from reiterating the rule on the duty of trial courts to
exercise solicitous care before sentencing the accused on a plea of guilty,
especially in capital offenses, WE also said that trial judges should give
ample opportunity to the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
to examine not <span style="">only </span>the records
of the case but also the <span style="">scene o</span>f
the crime as well as to confer with the accused lengthily so that he can
properly, intelligently, and fully represent and defend the interests of the
accused; and</p>

<p class="NUM">7. The latest case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Hondolero</span>
(G.R. No. L-40633, August 25, 1976), where WE reiterated the rule long
established since the <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span>, Rota and <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span> cases, <u>supra</u><span style="">, </span>that "since there is no law prohibiting the taking of
testimony after a plea of guilty, where a grave offense is charged, this Court
has deemed such taking of testimony the prudent and proper course to follow for
the purpose of establishing <span style="">not only
the guilt but as well </span>as <span style="">the </span>precise
degree of culpability of the defendant."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE hasten to add what WE
said in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ricalde</span> (L-34673, January 30,
1973), which is somehow identical in most, if not all, respects to the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, this COURT, speaking
through Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, sounded once more its concern over the
failure of trial courts to comply strictly with the <span style="">procedural paths WE have adverted to as early as the <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said </span>this COURT:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Our previous decisions have repeatedly warned against the
danger of the plea of guilty being improvidently entered in capital cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE have uniformly stressed the importance of
the trial court's receiving evidence notwithstanding the plea of guilty in
order that no reasonable doubt may remain as to the guilt and the degree of
culpability of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have time
and time again reminded judges that they are duty bound to be extra solicitous
in <span style="">seeing </span>to it that when an
accused pleads guilty he understands fully the meaning of his plea and the
import of inevitable conviction (US vs. <span class="SpellE">Jamad</span>, 37
Phil. 305; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bulalake</span>, 106 Phil. 767; <span style="">People vs. <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span>, </span>27
SCRA, 1037).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, We are not satisfied that the trial judge
has properly discharged this basic duty enjoined of him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As pointed out by both the counsel for the appellant and the
Solicitor General, the trial judge limited himself to asking two brief<span style=""> questions from the appellant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether the appellant was aware of the con­sequences
of his change of plea from not guilty to that of guilty, and whether the
appellant knew that notwithstanding such plea of guilty the only possible
penalty was that of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record is
completely bereft of any indication that the court diligently ascertained for
itself whether the appellant completely understand the full meaning
significance </span>and implications of his plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court likewise failed to inform the
appellant of the aggravating circumstances alleged in the amended information
and their effect on his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the
court failed to ask the appellant whether he was invoking mitigating
circumstances in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the
court did not make any inquiry, which inquiry was obviously called for, why the
appellant had a sudden change of plea after he had previously pleaded not
guilty to the charge against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
sum, the trial court failed to take the necessary precautions to forestall the
entry by the appellant of an improvident plea of guilty before passing judgment
upon him."</blockquote>
