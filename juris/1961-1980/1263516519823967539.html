taken by the State from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> dismissing Criminal Case No. 2156 but leaving
Criminal Case No. 2153, of the same court, to proceed to trial and final
judgment.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Juan Gil, Angel <span class="SpellE">Cabiugin</span>
<span style="">and Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Limpiado</span>
were charged separately by the offended parties, Jose </span><span class="SpellE">Malingit</span> <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Calo</span>, Jr., for
defamation under Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code in the Justice of the
Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they had waived their right </span>to <span style="">preliminary investigation, the cases were
elevated to the Court of First Instance, where separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
were filed against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
arraignment they pleaded not guilty and the cases were subsequently set for
joint trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not
disclose clearly whether or not the joint trial had actually began with the
presentation of <span style="">the </span>prosecution
witnesses, but it shows that the court, <span class="SpellE"><i style="">motu</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i style="">proprio</i></span>,
raised this question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the acts
complained </span>of <span style="">as slanderous were
uttered on the same date, and at the same place, albeit against two different
persons; that such being the case there should have been only one information
against the parties charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">After
hearing both parties upon this issue the court issued the order appealed from
dismissing one of the cases, - Criminal Case No. 2156 - but leaving the other -
Criminal Case No. 2153 - outstanding, to proceed to trial and final judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the
prosecution that our decision in People vs. Del Rosario (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-2254, April 1950) for libel is controlling.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in said case there are in the case before <span class="GramE">Us</span> as many offenses as there were persons defamed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as stated heretofore, the accused in
both cases had already pleaded not guilty when the court, <span class="SpellE"><i style="">motu</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i style="">proprio</i></span>, raised the question of
multiplicity of prosecution for offenses arising from one and the same act, and
for this reason dismissed Criminal Case No. 2156.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the dismissal - although erroneous - was
not at the instance of the defendants themselves, it must be deemed sufficient
to bar prosecution for the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To reverse the order of dismissal complained of and order the case to
proceed would therefore constitute double jeopardy (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> 43 Phil 613; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Golez</span> G.R. L-14160, June 30, 1960; People vs.
Hernandez, 49 O.G. 5342).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">,</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> judgment is
hereby rendered dismissing the appeal, without pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
