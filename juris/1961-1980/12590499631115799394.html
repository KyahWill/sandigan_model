				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>On May 15, 1958, Norberto Desalisa y Doca and Dominador Bartonico y Japitana 
were charged in the Municipal Court of Manila (Crim. Case No. 46383) with the 
crime of "Serious Physical Injuries Thru Reckless Imprudence", in an information 
which reads as follows:</p>
<p align="center">"INFORMATION</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned accuses Norberto Desalisa y Doca and Dominador Bartonico y 
Japitana of serious physical injuries thru reckless imprudence, committed as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 14th day of May, 1958, in the City of Manila, 
Philippines, the said accused, being then the drivers and persons in charge of 
Josefa Carrier Bus with plate No. TPU-5227, Philippines, and cargo truck bearing 
plate No. T-33718, Philippines, respectively, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully, and feloniously drive, manage, and operate the same along Otis 
Street, in said City, in a careless, reckless, and imprudent manner, and without 
taking the necessary precaution to avoid accident to persons and damage to 
property, considering the condition of traffic at said place and time, by then 
and there driving their said vehicles at speeds greater than was reasonable and 
proper under the circumstance, causing by such carelessness, recklessness, 
imprudence, and lack of precautions the said vehicles so driven, managed, and 
operated by them to collide with, as same in fact collided with each other, and 
as a result of the impact, passengers of said Josefa Carrier Bus, namely, 
Gertrudes Adecer, Preciosa Almario, Flavio Zalameda, Candido Aguinaldo, Jr., 
Jose Reyes, Vicenta Aguinaldo, Conrado Agerion, Rufino Agosto, and Felicitas 
Sarmiento sustained physical injuries, those of said Gertrudes Adecer requiring 
medical attendance for a period of more than thirty (30) days, and those of the 
rest requiring medical attendance for a period of not less 'than one (1) but not 
more than nine (9) days, and which injuries incapacitated and will incapacitate 
all the above-named persons from engaging in their customary labor during the 
said periods of time.</p>
<p>"Contrary to law."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>By reason of the subsequent death of the victim Gertrudes Adecer and 
ascertainment of the extent of the injuries sustained by victim Candido 
Aguinaldo, Jr., the above information was amended on May 27, 1958, by dropping 
therefrom the name of the deceased and adding thereto the clause "those 
(physical injuries) of Candido Aguinaldo, Jr. requiring medical attendance for a 
period of more than thirty (30) days". On the same date, an information for 
Homicide Thru Reckless Imprudence was filed in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila (Crim. Case No. 44176) against the same accused, for the death of 
Adecer.</p>
<p>The accused were arraigned in the Municipal Court (for physical injuries) on 
June 20, 1958, wherein they entered a plea of not guilty; while arraignment in 
the Court of First Instance (for homicide) was held on June 23, 1958, wherein 
the accused also pleaded not guilty. On August 29, 1958, the case for physical 
injuries of all complainants, except Vicenta Aguinaldo and Candido Aguinaldo, 
Jr. was dismissed by the Municipal Court upon motion of the Special Prosecutor, 
Thereafter, the trial proceeded with the Aguinaldos taking the witness stand. At 
this stage, defense counsel filed a motion to quash the information, on the 
ground of double jeopardy, it being alleged that the filing of separate cases 
(one in the Municipal Court, and the other in the Court of First Instance) for 
offenses arising out of a single act, placed them in danger of being twice 
convicted and penalized for the same act.</p>
<p>In its order of October 3, 1958, the municipal court, granted the motion, 
thus:</p>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Under consideration is a motion to quash filed by the accused Norberto 
Desalisa, on the ground of double jeopardy. </p>
<p>"The case at bar changes both accused with the crime of serious physical 
injuries thru reckless imprudence with multiple slight physical injuries arising 
from the same act and embodied in one information. Both accused have pleaded not 
guilty and the prosecution has presented its evidence. It is at this stage of 
the proceedings that the motion to quash is filed.</p>
<p>"Considering that the accused Norberto Desalisa is charged with homicide thru 
reckless imprudence with the Court of First Instance of Manila arising from the 
same act subject of this case; that this is a clear case of a complex crime 
where the accused should have been charged with homicide thru reckless 
imprudence complexed with serious physical injuries contained in one information 
and filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila, and another information 
for multiple slight physical injuries thru reckless imprudence with the 
Municipal Court of Manila, in accordance with the provisions of Art. 48 of the 
Revised Penal Code, as amended; that with the filing of the information for 
homicide thru reckless imprudence with the Court of First Instance of Manila 
with the present separate information for serious physical injuries thru 
reckless imprudence with multiple slight physical injuries pending in this 
Court, thereby exposing said accused twice in jeopardy of being convicted and 
penalized in both instances, contrary to law; the court is of the opinion and so 
holds that the motion to quash is well-founded and the rights of the accused 
cannot be prejudiced by the error of the state prosecution.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the motion to quash is 
hereby granted and this case dismissed with costs de oficio.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>The prosecution appealed the case to the Court of First Instance. In the 
meantime, the accused were found guilty of homicide in Criminal Case No. 44176 
originally tried in the Court of First Instance, from which decision they 
appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Before arraignment in the Court of First Instance, in connection with the 
physical injuries case on appeal from the Municipal Court, counsel for the 
defense filed a motion praying, among others, for the quashing of the 
information and the dismissal of the action, primarily on the ground of second 
jeopardy, contending</p>
<p>(1) That under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, the offense charged in 
Criminal Case No. 46383 of the Municipal Court should have been complexed with 
the homicide indictment in the Court of First Instance, and the prosecution's 
failure to do so, placed them in jeopardy of being twice convicted and penalized 
for the same act; and</p>
<p>(2) That the appeal of the prosecution from the order of dismissal of the 
Municipal Court subjects them to a second jeopardy before the Court of First 
Instance.</p>
<p>In his order of May 9, 1959, His Honor Judge Juan P. Enriquez of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, expressed the view that even on the theory that the 
two offenses, (homicide and physical injuries) constituted a complex crime under 
Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, still the failure of the accused to timely 
object to the splitting of offenses amounted to a waiver, and that the quashing 
of the information, at the instance of the accused, by the Municipal Court, did 
not place them in double jeopardy. However, in view of the allegedly unsettled 
law on double jeopardy, the court granted the accused's separate motions to 
quash, with direction to the prosecution to appeal the matter to this Court for 
final adjudication of the legal questions involved therein. Hence, the present 
appeal.</p>
<p>(1) Section 10 of Rule 113 of the Rules of Court provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 10. <em>Failure to move to quash—effect of—exception</em>.—If the 
defendant does not move to quash the complaint or information before he pleads 
thereto he shall be taken to have waived all objections which are grounds for a 
motion to quash except when the complaint or information does not charge an 
offense, or the court is without jurisdiction of the same. If, however, the 
defendant <em>learns after he has pleaded</em> or has moved to quash on some 
other ground that the offense with which he is now charged is an offense for 
which he has been pardoned, or of which he has been convicted or acquitted or 
been in jeopardy, the court may in its discretion entertain at any time before 
judgment a motion to quash on the ground of such pardon, conviction or 
jeopardy." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is evident therefrom that, as a general rule, failure of the accused to 
move to quash the complaint or information before pleading thereto constitutes a 
waiver of all the grounds for a motion to dismiss available to him<span class="style64"><sup>*</sup></span> (which includes the defense of jeopardy). The 
exceptions are: (1) in case the information or complaint does not charge an 
offense; (2) lack of jurisdiction of the court; and (3) if after pleading, or 
filing a motion to quash on another ground, the accused or defendant learns that 
he had already been pardoned, convicted, or acquitted or in jeopardy for the 
offense with which he is being charged. Clearly, therefore, in order that the 
court may entertain a motion to quash after arraignment, it must be shown that 
the accused <em>learned</em> or acquired knowledge of the defense being claimed 
by him, <em>after</em> his pleading to the charge. In the case at bar, it cannot 
be said that when the accused pleaded <em>not guilty</em> to the charges of 
serious physical injuries with multiple slight physical injuries in the 
Municipal Court, they were not aware of the existence of the homicide case 
pending before the Court of First Instance. It appears on record that the 
information for homicide was filed in the Court of First Instance on May 27, 
1958, on the same day that the information in the Municipal Court was amended, 
and that notice of the arraignment in the former case was received by the 
accused as early as May 30, 1958, or long before they actually entered their 
plea (on June 20, 1958) in the Municipal Court. Having thus failed to timely 
raise the objection, and considering that the prosecution vigorously opposed the 
motion to quash, the Municipal Court acted erroneously in granting the same and 
dismissing the case.</p>
<p>For the same reason given above, neither may the accused now question the 
correctness of the information filed in the Municipal Court charging them with 
the crimes of serious physical injuries and multiple slight physical injuries, 
both thru reckless imprudence.</p>
<p>(2) The second issue presented by the herein appellees is, as stated, that 
the appeal of the prosecution from the order of dismissal of the municipal court 
subjects them to a second jeopardy before the court of first instance.</p>
<p>It is the view of Judge Enriquez of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
before whom the appeal was heard, that the filing of the information for serious 
physical injuries through reckless imprudence, separate and independent of 
another information for homicide through reckless imprudence resulting from one 
single act did not place the accused, in both cases, in danger of double 
jeopardy because the accused did not object to the splitting of the offense 
which otherwise would have constituted a complex crime under Article 48 of the 
Revised Penal Code. Therefore, the trial court added, the dismissal upon 
petition of the accused of such information for serious physical injuries 
through reckless imprudence by the municipal court, on the erroneous assumption 
of the existence of double jeopardy, is a dismissal with the express consent of 
the accused. It follows that the appeal by the prosecution from such order of 
dismissal did not likewise constitute a second jeopardy to the accused. 
Nevertheless, Judge Enriquez dismissed the case and advised the prosecution to 
take an appeal to this Court, to eaable us to clarify the alleged uncertainty of 
the doctrine of double jeopardy brought about by the various pronouncements made 
in cases subsequent to that of <em>People v. Salico</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>There is some point in the observation of the trial Judge that, 
unfortunately, certain loose statements made in some of our decided cases tend 
to lead to some confusion on the subject of doubje jeopardy. It is, therefore, 
well that we re-examine these pertinent cases in an effort to crystallize the 
doctrine on this point of law.</p>
<p>There are two cardinal principles that must first be remembered: 
<em>first</em>, the first sentence of Rule 118, Section 2 of the Rules of Court 
(now Rule 122, Amended Rules) which reads, "<em>The People of the Philippines 
cannot appeal if the defendant would be placed thereby in double jeopardy</em>," 
does not import to be an absolute prohibition tor the prosecution to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> For, it may be pointed out, this provision 
prohibiting the appeal by tne prosecution, is actually a negative statement 
conditioned on defendants being thereby placed in double jeopardy. In fine, it 
is only another way of saying that the prosecution can appeal <em>except</em> 
when the defendant would, by such appeal, be placed in double jeopardy. This is 
further supported by the succeeding sentence of the same provision, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"in all other cases, either party (which includes the prosecution) may appeal 
from a final judgment or ruling or from an order made after judgment affecting 
the substantial rights of the appellant."</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, it is now the established rule that the immunity of an 
accused to a second jeopardy of conviction for the same offense is a personal 
privilege which the accused may waive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>Putting these doctrines together, we may state that the prosecution can 
appeal from a dismissal-order of the lower court if such appeal will not place 
the accused in second jeopardy, <em>or</em> if there is waiver by the accused of 
the defense of double jeopardy. The corollary questions that necessarily come up 
are: When does an appeal constitute a second jeopardy? When is there waiver by 
the accused of the defense of double jeopardy?</p>
<p>The seeming uncertainty of the rule on this legal point started with the 
ruling in the Salico case, <em>supra</em>. In that case, after the accused had 
entered a plea of <em>not guilty</em> to the charge of homicide and after the 
prosecution had rested but before he could have presented his evidence, the 
accused filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that "the fiscal failed to prove 
that the offense was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the 
court." The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental granted the motion, and 
the prosecution appealed. Here, the issue of double jeopardy was raised by the 
accused-appellee. 
</p><p>Overruling the contention of appellee, this Court held that there is no 
double jeopardy in the appeal, because: (1) the dismissal of the case by the 
court below was upon the motion of the accused; (2) the appeal by the 
prosecution would not place him in second <em>jeopardy</em>; and (3) assuming 
<em>arguendo</em> that the accused had thus been placed in danger of second 
conviction for the same offense, defendant's failure to set up that defense 
constituted a waiver of the right. It was declared that by the action of the 
accused in causing the dismissal of the case, he had waived the right to set up 
the defense of double jeopardy because he thereby prevented the Court from 
proceeding to the trial on the merits and rendering a judgment of conviction 
against him. It was held that the appeal could not have also exposed him in 
danger of a second conviction, because the issue raised for the determination of 
the appellate court is not the guilt or innocence of the defendant, but the 
legal question of whether the offense was committed within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the trial court. The dismissal of the case was, consequently, 
held erroneous and the same was remanded to the lower court for further 
proceedings.</p>
<p>The <em>Salico</em> case, therefore, laid down the doctrines that, an appeal 
by the prosecution is not absolutely prohibited; that a motion to dismiss by the 
defendant amounts to a waiver of his right to invoke the doctrine of double 
jeopardy incase of an appeal by the prosecution from the dismissal-order; and 
that an appeal (or properly a second case) will not constitute a second jeopardy 
if the appeal is not concerned with the merits of the case, i.e., with the guilt 
or innocence of the accused. Furthermore, it was ruled that the failure of the 
accused to raise the defense against the appeal constitutes waiver by the 
accused of his right to invoke the doctrine of double jeopardy.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>People v. Bangalao, et al</em>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> however, the appeal of the prosecution was 
dismissed by this Court. The accused in that case, after pleading not guilty to 
the charge, filed a motion to dismiss, for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Although it was held that the court 
actually had jurisdiction over the case and the dismissal of the case was 
erroneous, this Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x we find the claim of the defendants-appellees that the appeal can not 
prosper because it puts them in double jeopardy, must be sustained. Under 
Section 2, Rule 118 of the Rules of Court, the People of the Philippines can not 
appeal if the accused or defendant is placed thereby in double jeopardy. As the 
court below had jurisdiction to try the case upon the filing of the complaint by 
the mother of tne offended party, the defendants-appeilees would be placed in 
double jeopardy if the appeal is allowed."</p></blockquote>The pronouncement 
seems to erase the qualifications made in the Salico case for the application of 
the principle of double jeopardy to appeals by the prosecution.
<p></p>
<p>In the case of People v. Reyes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6] </sup>the 
information was quashed by the lower court, upon motion of the accused, before 
trial could be had, because it failed to allege the element of use of violence 
although the offense charged was coercion under Article 287 of the Revised Penal 
Code. On appeal by the prosecution, the order of the lower court was reversed, 
its jurisdiction was upheld and the case was remanded to it for further 
proceedings, this Court saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The contention of defendants-appellees that the present appeal would place 
them in double jeopardy is unfounded. 'Where the complaint or information is in 
truth valid and sufficient, but the case is dismissed upon petition of the 
accused on the ground that the complaint or information is invalid and 
insufficient, such dismissal will not bar another prosecution for the same 
offense and the defendant is estopped from alleging in the second prosecution 
that the former dismissal was wrong because the complaint or information was 
valid.' (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952 ed., Vol. II, p. 
802)."</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the right of the prosecution to appeal was again upheld, the 
theory of the Court, which'was also adopted (7) in the earlier case of 
<em>People v. Acierto</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> being that 
of estoppel. A party that secures the dismissal of the information in the lower 
court by assailing the jurisdiction of that court, cannot, in the appeal, change 
his theory by asserting the jurisdiction of the lower court in order to support 
his allegation that the appeal would place him in double Jeopardy. There 
apparently was a "reversion" to the doctrine in the <em>Salico</em> case.</p>
<p>However, in the same year, the Supreme Court again declared against the 
appeal of the prosecution from a dismissal order of the lower court. In the case 
of <em>People v. Ferrer</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the 
question raised by the prosecution was the correctness of the dismissal of the 
case by the lower court at defendant's instance, on the ground that the 
territorial jurisdiction of the court had not been established.<span class="style64"><sup>[9]</sup></span> The Supreme Court declared that the 
information was sufficient and the dismissal of the case was, therefore, 
erroneous. Nevertheless, it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unfortunately, however, we believe that the Government however meritorious 
its case cannot appeal the order of dismissal without violating the right of the 
defendant not to be placed in double jeopardy. The accused herein has not filed 
a brief or appeal raising this question of double jeopardy. Nevertheless, Rule 
118, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides: 'The People of the Philippines 
can not appeal if the.defendant would be placed thereby in double jeopardy, and 
we have to give force and effect to said rule. Here, the defendant had already 
been arraigned and he had entered his plea, and the trial had begun, and the 
prosecution had rested its case. We hold that the appeal of the Government from 
the order of dismissal would place the accused in double 
jeopardy."</p></blockquote>
<p>This case, far from being an abandonment of the Salico case, furnishes 
instead, an application of the rulings therein established. The dismissal here 
was on the merits as it was predicated on the supposed failure of the fiscal to 
prove the location of the house where the offense was committed. It was 
therefore a dismissal on the supposed insufficiency of evidence and hence a 
dismissal on the merits amounting to an acquittal.</p>
<p>In the case of People v. Robles, et al.,<span class="style64"><sup>[10]</sup></span> this Court denied the appeal by the 
prosecution from the order of the lower court, sustaining defendant's plea that 
the amended information filed therein constituted double jeopardy. In that case, 
a first information for violation of Article 199, paragraphs (b) and (c), of the 
Revised Penal Code was previously dismissed, upon motion of the fiscal, due to 
non-appearance of prosecution witnesses. Two years later, a new information for 
the same offense was filed. The accused were arraigned and entered <em>not 
guilty</em>-pleas. But due to the absence of prosecution witnesses, the trial 
was postponed several times. When the fiscal asked for another postponement of 
the scheduled hearing, the defendants opposed, on the ground that such further 
postponement would violate their right to speedy trial. Sustained by the lower 
court, the case was dismissed on that ground. Three years thereafter, the fiscal 
filed another information for the same offense. The defendant moved to quash the 
information on the ground that it would place him in second jeopardy, as a 
result of which, the case was dismissed. In affirming the appealed order, this 
Court declared that the second dismissal of the case against defendants was not 
merely provisional, but an acquittal on the merits, because it was brought about 
by the failure of the prosecution to go to trial, thus resulting in the 
violation of defendant's right to speedy trial. However, the following 
statements were also made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"in reaching the above conclusion, we have not overlooked our ruling in the 
case of People vs. Salico, 44 Off. Gaz., No. 4, 1765-1776, rei- terated in 
People vs. Romero, G.R. Nos. L4517-20", to the effect that a dismissal upon 
defendant's motion will not be a bar to another prosecution for the same offense 
as said dismissal was not without the express consent of the defendant, which 
ruling the prosecution now invokes in support of this appeal; but said ruling is 
not now controlling, having been modified or abandoned in subsequent cases 
wherein we sustained the theory of double jeopardy despite the fact that the 
dismissal was secured upon motion of the accused. (People v. Bangalao, L-5610, 
Feb. 17, 1954; People v. Diaz, L-6518, March 30, 1954; People v. Abafio, L-7862, 
May 17, 1955; and People v. Ferrer, L-9072, Oct. 23, 1956.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>And, in the case of <em>People v. Labatete</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> wherein the appeal by the prosecution 
from the order of dismissal of the case by the lower court was denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Supreme Court lexplained the 
"abandonment" of the Salico-doctrine as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"it will be noted that there are three cases where jeopardy would lie, 
according to the above provision (Sec. 9, Rule 113), namely, <i>conviction 
acquittal, or dismissal or other termination of the case without the express 
consent of the accused</i>. Note that the phrase <i>without the express consent 
of the accused</i> can not refer to <i>conviction or acquittal</i> because in 
case of conviction after trial and without a plea of guilty, the termination is 
against the express consent of the accused. The only conviction which would be 
had with the express consent of the accused would be when a plea of guilty has 
been entered. When the defendant is acquitted after trial, it is always upon 
petition of the accused. If we were to make the said phrase (without the express 
consent of the accused) applicable to acquittal, there would be no case of 
jeopardy even when there is acquittal, because the acquittal will always be with 
the express consent, because ordinarily granted upon motion of the accused. So 
it is that the phrase <i>with the express consent of the accused</i> can refer 
only to a <i>dismissal or other termination</i>, not a conviction or 
acquittal.</p>
<p>"What, then, is a dismissal with the exppess consent of the accused, which is 
not an acquittal? Such dismissal, in the first place, must not be one where the 
court has no jurisdiction, or where the information is not valid or sufficient 
to sustain a conviction, for in these cases no jeopardy attaches by express 
provision of the rule. Also, the dismissal must be after the defendant has 
pleaded, as also provided expressly in the rule. x x x.</p>
<p>"One case contemplated by the rule as a dismissal or termination of the case 
would be where the fiscal, upon the case being called for trial and after a plea 
has been entered, states that he is not ready to proceed and the accused, who is 
not agreeable to a postponement, is willing to have the case dismissed 
provisionally. The dismissal is provisional and there would not be any jeopardy 
at all. Another is when after plea the accused asks for another investigation, 
or the fiscal asks for it, and the court which does not want to have a case 
pending because of the possibility that there may be no sufficient evidence 
ultimately, dismisses the case. Still another is where the accused is to be used 
as State witness, and is willing to act as such, so the case is dismissed. Of 
course, he will still be subject to prosecution if he fails to comply with his 
commitment. For the moment we cannot think of any other instance, but similar 
instances may happen when the dismissal is no bar to another prosecution. It is 
similar to a dismissal without prejudice in civil cases.</p>
<p>"We can see that none of the above possibilities existed in the case of 
Salico. The judgment was not a provisional dismissal of the case entered with 
a possibility of filing of a subsequent one. The judgment of the trial court was 
in fact an <em>acquittal</em> because of failure on the part of the fiscal to 
prove that the crime was committed within the jurisdiction of the court. The 
judgment was in fact a final judgment of acquittal. The mere fact that the 
accused asked for his acquittal after trial on the merits, is no reason for 
saying that the case was 'dismissed' with his express consent and he may again 
be subjected to another prosecution."</p></blockquote>
<p>According to this "explanation", the <em>Salico</em>-doctrine was "abandoned" 
because the dismissal of the case therein by the lower court was not merely 
provisional, but actually an acquittal, caused by the failure of the fiscal to 
prove that the crime was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the 
court. The ruling in the case of Salico, that the act of the defendant in moving 
for the dismissal of the case constitutes a waiver of the right to avail of the 
defense of double jeopardy, insofar as it applies to dismissals which do not 
amount to acquittal or dismissal of the case on the merits, cannot be considered 
to have been abandoned by the subsequent decisions on the matter. This becomes 
more evident when the Court, in the case of People v. Casiano, supra, stated 
that Section 2 of Rule 118 of the Rules of Court is not a limitation on the 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to entertain appeals by the Government in 
criminal case or to "<em>right of the latter to appeal in such cases</em>."</p>
<p>From the above rulings and pronouncements of the Court, the rule on double 
jeopardy may perhaps be re-stated thus:</p>
<p>As a general rule, the dismissal or termination of a case, by the proper 
court, after arraignment and plea of the defendant to a valid information, shall 
be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to 
commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily 
includes or is necessarily included in the offense, in the former complaint or 
information (Sec. 9, Rule 113). However, an appeal by the prosecution from the 
order of dismissal (of the criminal case) by the trial court will not constitute 
double jeopardy if (1) the dismissal is made upon motion, or with the express 
consent, of the defendant, <em>and</em> (2) the dismissal is not an acquittal or 
based upon consideration of the evidence or of the merits of the case; 
<em>and</em> (3) the question to be passsd upon by the appellate court is purely 
legal so that should the dismissal be found incorrect, the case would have to be 
remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings, to determine the guilt 
or innocence of the defendant.</p>
<p>In the present case, considering that there was waiver of the defense of 
double jeopardy by the failure of the accused to object to the filing of the 2 
cases in the court of first instance and in the municipal court; that the 
dismissal was not based on consideration of the merits of the case; and the 
question raised in the appeal was purely legal, the appeal by the prosecution 
from the order of dismissal in the municipal court to the Court of First 
Instance did not place them in second jeopardy.</p>
<p>Neither does the present appeal from the order of dismissal of the Court of 
First Instance constitute a second jeopardy, because the motion to quash was 
filed by the accused themselves before arraignment and before they entered their 
plea to the information.</p>
<p><strong>Upon these considerations</strong>, the order of dismissal appealed 
from is hereby set aside. The case is remanded to the court of origin (the 
Municipal Court of Manila) for further proceedings. No costs.</p>

<p><span class="style64"><sup>[5]</sup></span> It was alleged in the motion to 
dismiss that in the complaint filed by the mother of the offended party, the 
allegation was that the crime (of rape) was committed through the use of force 
and intimidation, whereas in the information filed by the fiscal, no such 
allegation appeared and instead, it was stated therein that the offended party 
was a minor and demented girl.</p>

jeopardy.</p></div></div>
