				<BR><STRONG>MAKASIAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On January 9, 1951, a decision was rendered by the Manila Court
of First Instance granting petitioner Yao Mun Tek his petition for
naturalization (pp. 70-73, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated January 26, 1953, the Manila Court of First
Instance allowed him to take his oath of allegiance as a Filipino citizen and
directed the clerk of court to issue in his favor the corresponding certificate
of naturalization, after finding that he had complied with the provisions of
R.A. No. 530 (p. 113, rec.).  Thereafter
that same day, January 26, 1953, petitioner took his oath of allegiance (p.
114, rec.) without waiting for the expiration of thirty days from January 27,
1953 the date of receipt by the Solicitor General of the order allowing him to
take his oath of allegiance (p. 122, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 18, 1963, the Solicitor General filed a petition dated
June 13, 1963 to declare the decision granting petitioner his petition for naturalization
null and void and to cancel the certificate of naturalization on the ground
that the notice of hearing of his application for naturalization was published
only once in the Official Gazette, not once a week for three consecutive weeks
as required by law, and that Atty. Marcelo P. Karaan was substituted as his
character <span style="">witness in lieu </span>of his
original witness Dr. Albino Sycip on the ground that Dr. Sycip was not
available on the day of the hearing due to pressure of work, without first
amending the <span style="">petition, without </span>Atty.
Karaan executing an affidavit attesting to the good character of the
petitioner, since he was not one of those who signed the original joint
affidavit attached to the petition, and without any amended petition containing
the substitution having been published (pp. 131-133, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated May 27, 1964, the Manila Court of First
Instance nullified the decision dated January 9, 1951, granting Philippine
citizenship to the petitioner and cancelled the certi­ficate of naturalization
issued in his favor (pp. 189-198, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">After his motion for reconsideration on the said order was denied
(p. 209, rec.), petitioner interposed this appeal (p. 210, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 14, 1946, petitioner Yao Mun Tek filed his
application for naturalization which specifically mentions Dr. Albino Sycip and
Atty. Perfecto Jose as his character witnesses (p. 1, rec.), together with
their joint affidavit (Exh. A, p. 5, rec.).  The notice of petition for Filipino citizenship was published in the
Official Gazette only once -- in the issue of September, 1946 (Exh. B-1, <span style="">p. </span>10, rec.), and in the Manila Post
on September 18, September 25 and October 2, 1946 (Exh. B, p. 9, rec.).  Said notice was likewise posted together
with copies of the petition and affidavits attached thereto on the bulletin
board of the Court of First Instance of Manila then located at the Central
Hotel Building, Azcarraga St. (now Claro M. Recto Avenue), corner Rizal Avenue <span style="">(see back </span>of p. 8, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">But the said notice of the petition as posted and as published
once in the Official Gazette of September, 1946 and thrice <span style="">in </span>the Manila Post on September 18, 25
and October 2, 1946 does not contain paragraphs 7, 8, 10 and 11 of the
petition, to wit:  that he has all the
qualifications under Sec. 4 of Com. Act No. 473, as amended by Com. Act No.
535; that he believes in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution;
that he has conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the
entire period of his residence in the Philippines, in his relation with the
constituted government as well as with the community in which he is living;
that <span style="">he has mingled socially with the
Filipinos and has evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace the customs,
traditions and ideals of the Filipinos; that he is not opposed to organized
government or affiliated with any association or group of persons who uphold
and teach the doctrines opposing all organized government; that he is not
defending or teaching the necessity or propriety of violence, personal assault,
or assassination for the success or predomi­nance of <span style="">his </span>ideas; that he is not a polygamist nor a believer in the
practice of polygamy; that he has not been convicted of any crime involving
moral turpitude; that he is not suffering from any incurable, contagious
disease; that the nation of which he is a citizen is not at war with the
Philippines; that it is his inten­tion in good faith to become a citizen of the
Philippines and to renounce absolutely and forever all allegiance and fidelity
to any prince, foreign potentate, State or sovereignty, particularly to China
of which he is a citizen; that he will reside continuously in the Philippine
from the date of the filing of the petition up to the time of his admission to
Philippine citizenship; and that he has not heretofore made any petition for
citizenship to any country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition itself does not expressly and specifically allege
that he is of good moral character and that he is not suffering from mental
alienation as required by Secs. 2 and 4 in relation to Sec. 7 of Com. Act No.
473, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the petition is attached the certificate of arrival (Exh. C,
p. 4, rec.).  No declaration of
intention was annexed to the petition presumably because the petitioner
believes that he is exempted from filing the same for he alleged that he has
resided <span style="">in </span>the Philippines
continuously for at least thirty years before the filing of his application and
that he has given primary and secondary education to all his children in the
pri­vate schools recognized by the government and not limited to any race or
nationality.</p>

<p class="BODY">The clerk of court as ex oficio sheriff of the Court of First
Instance of Manila certified that he had served a copy of the petition and its
annexes on the Solicitor General (see back of p. 8, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 14, 1947, Atty. Vicente Sotto, through his assistant
Atty. Laura G. Rafales, filed an intervention as amicus curiae and an
opposition to the petition on the ground that petitioner does not possess the
qualifications required by law to be a Filipino citizen; that petitioner filed
his application to escape deportation, to obtain facilities to exploit our
natural resources, to operate steam vessels and other public services and to
strangle economi­cally the Filipino people by means of profiteering,
blackmarketing <span style="">and other condemnable
methods; and that there is no law in the Chinese Republic allowing the
Filipinos to acquire Chinese citi­zenship (p. 16, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 18, 1950, petitioner, through counsel, filed a petition
to substitute Atty. Marcelo P. Karaan for his witness Dr. Albino C. Sycip on
the ground that the latter will not be able to attend the hearing on July 26,
1950 due to pressure of work as President and General Manager of the China
Banking Corporation, attaching thereto the affidavit of Atty. Karaan as Annex
B-1 now Exh. A-1 (pp. 20-22, rec.), which motion was granted in an order dated
July 22, 1950, because there was no objection thereto (p. 24, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">But the petition was not amended to substitute Atty. Karaan for
Dr. Albino Sycip, much less was there any such amended peti­tion published in
the Official Gazette and in a newspaper of general circulation in Manila once a
week for three consecutive weeks nor <span style="">posted
in the bulletin board of the court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">His landing certificate of residence dated June 30, 1950, Exh. D,
shows that he is from Amoy, China, born on December 13, 1909, and son of a
merchant with local residence as 1051 Aceyteros (p. 34, rec.); while his
petition states that his residence is 584 Alva­rado, Manila (p. 1, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">His alien certificate of registration dated July 17, 1950 states
that his address is 584-B Alvarado, Manila and that he is a sub-accountant of
the China Banking Corporation at Dasmariñas, Manila (Exh. E, p. 35, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">His marriage certificate (Exh. F) dated October 15, 1933 states
that he resides at 666 Ilaya, Tondo, Manila <span style="">(p. </span>36, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The birth certificates of his children Evangeline Yao Khim Kheng
and Bonifacio Yao state that they were born respectively on October 26, 1934
and May 14, 1936 and his residence as 666 and 666-A Ilaya, Tondo, Manila (Exhs.
H and H-1, pp. 38-39, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">His daughter, Evangeline Yao, was a first year high school
student in the Philippine Chinese High School at 881 Reina Regente St., Manila
(Exh. I, p. 46, rec.); while his sons Leoncio Yao and Bonifacio Yao were
enrolled in the Anglo Chinese School respectively in the 4th and 5th grade as
of September 6, 1950 (Exh. I-2, p. 48, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now a well imbedded principle that a judgment directing
issuance of certificate of naturalization is a mere grant of political <span style="">privilege; and that neither estoppel nor res
judicata may be invoked to bar the State from initiating an action for the can­cellation
or nullification of the certificate of naturalization thus issued.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The statutory requirement that the notice of hearing in a
naturalization case shall be published once a week for three consecutive weeks
in the Official Gazette and in a news­paper of general circulation in the city
or province, is juris­dictional and non-compliance therewith renders all the
proceedings in such a case null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> This
rule however applies only to certificates of naturalization issued after May
29, 1957 when the Ong Son Cui case was decided.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But there are several causes, hereinafter mentioned, which
nullify the 1951 decision granting petitioner Filipino citizenship, the 1953
order allowing him to take his oath of allegiance, his oath of allegiance, and
the certificate of naturalization issued in his favor.</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His petition for naturalization was not posted
nor published in its entirety as required by law; for paragraphs 7, 8, 10 and
11 thereof were omitted, which omission is fatal to the validity of his
petition.  We repeat that the
requirement of Sec. 9 of Com. Act No. 473 that a copy of the petition shall be
published and posted must be strictly and fully complied with, for the same is
jurisdictional.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
does the petition allege that he is of good moral character and that he is </span>not
suffering from mental alienation as directed by Secs. 2 and 4 in relation to
Sec. 7 of Com. Act No. 473, as amended.  This serious infirmity cannot be disregarded.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His petition was not amended to substitute
Atty. Marcelo Karaan as his character witness in lieu of Dr. Albino Sycip, much
less was such an amended petition posted on the bulletin board of the court and
published in the Official Gazette and a newspaper of general circulation.  Death of one character witness may justify
such substitution<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
but not when both character witnesses are alive, as in the instant case.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason why the names and addresses of the character witnesses should be
mentioned in the petition and in the notice of publication is to give the
government the opportunity to ascertain whether the cha­racter witnesses are
citizens of the Philippines, whether they are credible persons, and whether
they have personal knowledge of the petitioner during his residence in the
country for the period of time required by law, so that the witnesses will not
make impositions on the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His petition does not state his previous
residences at 666 Ilaya, Tondo, Manila and at 1051 Aceyteros, Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the oath of allegiance taken by the
petitioner on January 26, 1953 immediately after the order allowing him to take
such oath of allegiance issued on the same day, is null and void because the
order was not yet final as the period of thirty (30) days within which the
govern­ment may appeal from the receipt on January 27, 1953 of said order by
the Solicitor General had not yet elapsed.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed; and
the judgment of the Manila Court of First Instance dated January 9, 1951
granting the petition for naturalization, the order dated January 26, 1953
allowing petitioner Yao Mun Tek to take his oath of allegiance, his oath of
allegiance likewise dated January 26, 1953, and the certificate of
naturalization issued in his favor also on January 26, 1953, are hereby
declared null and void and accordingly cancelled and revoked.  With costs against petitioner-appellant.</p>
