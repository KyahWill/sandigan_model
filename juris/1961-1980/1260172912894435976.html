				<H3>MARIA VELASCO AND MARIA ABORDE, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. CARLOS VELASCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Fr. Mariano Velasco, Exequiel Velasco, Filomena M. Velasco, Jose M. Velasco 
and Santiago M. Velasco, were brothers. Plaintiff Maria Velasco was the daugther 
of Graciano Velasco, a son of Exequiel Velasco; while plaintiff Maria Aborde, 
was the daughter of Balbina Velasco, deceased daughter of Exequiel Velasco. In 
1917, Exequiel died intestate, leaving properties designated as Parcel 1, Parcel 
II and Parcel III, in the complaint, which were placed under his administration. 
In 1929, defendant Carlos Velasco, a natural son of Fr. Mariano, took possession 
of Parcels I and II and claimed ownership thereof. Parcel III was the subject of 
a litigation, for recovery of ownership, between Maria Aborde and her husband 
Pascual Bihag, as plaintiffs, and Carlos Velasco, as defendant (Annex D, Case 
No. 833, CFI, Camarines Sur), but the former lost the case because of the 
presentation of certain documents (Annexes A, B, &amp; C of the complaint), by 
the defendant, the validity and genuineness of which have not been questioned. 
The decision of the lower court in said case No. 833, was confirmed by the Court 
of Appeals (CA—G. R. No. 8085—R).
<p>Annex A of the complaint, some as Exhibit 5-A, purports to be a document 
signed by Exequiel Velasco grandfather of the appellants, as administrator of 
certain parcels of land, Fr. Mariano Velasco, Filomena, Jose and Santiago, 
evidencing the distribution of the properties supposedly purchased by the late 
Fr. Mariano and acknowledging that they did not belong to Exequiel. Annex B, 
same as Exhibit 6-A, is apparently a document signed by Exequiel, ceding the 
properties situated in Bantolinao, Gotob, Sabang, Mainit and Ermita, to Carlos 
Velasco. Annex C, same as Exhibit 1-A, is supposed to be an undated letter 
written by Exequiel and addressed to Maria Aborde and Pascual Bihag, confirming 
the fact that the lands mentioned in Exhibit 6-A, originally belonged to Fr. 
Mariano.</p>
<p>The present complaint prays: (1) under the first cause of action, that 
plaintiffs be declared the owners in common of parcels I and II and that 
co-plaintiff Maria Aborde be declared the exclusive owner of parcels III; that 
the defendant Carlos Velasco vacate parcels I and II and deliver the possession 
thereof to plaintiffs; and that the documents Annexes A, B, and C of the 
complaint, be declared null and void for being false and forged; (2) under the 
second cause of action, that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in CA G. R. 
No. 8085—R (CFI Civil Case No. 833, Cam. Sur), be annulled and set aside the 
same having been obtained by defendant thru fraudulent means and machinations, 
by presenting in said case falsified and forged exhibits; that the Provincial 
Sheriff of Camarines Sur be impeded from executing the judgment in CA-G.R. No. 
8085-R; which had already become final and executory; and (3) under the third 
cause of action, that the defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiffs the sum of 
P500.00 for attorney's fees and costs and the further sum of P2,000.00 for 
actual and moral damages.</p>
<p>On October 24, 1956, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
on the grounds that the plaintiffs' causes of action are barred by a prior 
judgment and their causes of action have long prescribed.</p>
<p>In a resolution handed down on November 14, 1956, the lower court held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first ground alleged in support of the motion to dismiss is not tenable 
because there is no identity of the parties and subject-matter. In the former 
case, one of the plaintiffs herein was not a party and the two parcels of land 
sought to be recovered in this action were not involved in the prior litigation. 
Prescription cannot be alleged either as a ground for dismissal for the reason 
that although the complaint alleges that the defendant took possession of the 
lands in question in 1929, it does not aver that since that year he has been 
possessing the land openly, publicly and under a claim of title exclusive of any 
other right. The complaint merely states that the defendant now claims ownership 
over two of the parcels in litigation."</p></blockquote>
<p>On November 27, 1956, defendant filed an answer, with affirmative defenses 
and counterclaim, to which plaintiffs replied.</p>
<p>On October 11, 1956, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the 
order denying the motion to dismiss. An order was issued on October 24, 1957, 
stating that "<em>the motion to dismiss this case as to Maria Aborde so far as 
parcel III is concerned is hereby sustained</em>". Plaintiffs appealed the 
order, but the Court of Appeals certified it to Us, the question raised being 
purely legal in nature.</p>
<p>In upholding the cause of the defendant-appellee, the trial court held that: 
(1) the issue of genuineness and validity of annexes A, B, and C, of the 
complaint, were necessarily involved in Civil Case No. 833; (2) the judgment 
rendered in Civil Case No. 833 is conclusive on the validity and genuineness of 
said annexes, between Maria Aborde and Carlos Velasco, with respect to parcel 
III; (3) Annexes A, B and C can no longer be drawn in any subsequent case, as 
far as parcel III is concerned, even if said documents are in truth forgeries; 
and (4) the judgment rendered in said case No. 833, can no longer be 
annulled.</p>
<p>The primordial question, therefore, to determine is whether or not the former 
judgment in case No. 833 is at bar, under the principles of <em>res 
judicata</em>, on the present case, as far as parcel III is concerned.</p>
<p>Appellants even admit that "If ever the decision in case No. 833 would be 
conclusive, its conclusiveness would only affect plaintiffs therein, namely, 
Maria Aborde and Pascual Bihag" (appellants' brief). The fact that Maria Velasco 
is an additional plaintiff in the present case,' and was not a party-plaintiff 
in the former case, does not remove the case from the operation of the principle 
of <em>res judicata</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * although in the second action there are joined parties who were not 
joined in the first action, there is still <em>res adjudicata</em> if the party 
against whom the judgment is offered in evidence was a party in the first action 
(Peñalosa <em>vs</em>. Tuason, 22 Phil., 303-323). Otherwise, no matter how 
often a case be decided, the parties might renew the litigation by simply 
joining new parties (Alzua and Arnalot <em>vs</em>. Johnson, 21 Phil., 308, 
374") (San Diego <em>vs</em>. Cardona, 40 Off. Gaz., Supp. No. 12, 
116).</p></blockquote>
<p>Maria Velasco and Maria Aborde were first degree cousins and had a community 
of interest. They alleged co-ownership over the properties in question, with 
defendant Carlos Velasco. One plaintiff is a privy to her co-plaintiff. The 
subject matter in case No. 833 is the same parcel of land situated in Mainit, 
described as Parcel III, in the present complaint. The cause of action in case 
(No. 833), was for declaration of ownership and recovery of possession; the 
present complaint seeks to avoid Exhibits 5-A, 6-A and 1-A (same as annexes A, 
B, and C) presented in the said case (No. 833), on the ground of forgery, and to 
annul the decision of the Court of Appeals, in order that they 
(plaintiffs-appellants), may be declared owners of the properties in question. 
It should be noted that the same evidence would support and established both the 
present and the former causes of action. The probability that the documents were 
forged is irrelevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * "Briefly stated, this doctrine is that an existing final judgment or 
decree rendered upon the merits, and without fraud or collusion, by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, upon a matter within its jurisdiction, is conclusive of 
the rights of the parties or their privies, in all other actions, or suits in 
the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction, on the 
points and matters in issue in the first suit. (15 R. C. L., 949-951.)" National 
Bank <em>vs</em>. Barreto, 52 Phil., 823-824).</p>
<p>"* * * an adjudication is finally conclusive not only as to the matter 
actually determined, but as to every other matter which the parties might have 
litigated and have had decided incident to or essentially connected with the 
subject matter of litigation, and every matter coming within the legitimate 
purview of the original action, both with respect to matter of claim and of 
defense" (Miranda <em>vs</em>. Tiangco, et al., 96 Phil., 526; 51 Off. Gaz., [3] 
1366; NAMARCO <em>vs</em>. Macadaeg, 98 Phil., 185; 52 Off. Gaz., 182; Alfredo 
Pua <em>vs</em>. Lapitan, 107 Phil., 95; 57 Off. Gaz., 4914).</p></blockquote>
<p>The judgment in Civil Case No. 833 (CA-G. R. No. 8085-R) can no longer be 
annulled. As a general rule, extrinsic or collateral fraud, would warrant a 
court of justice to set aside or annul a judgment, based on fraud (Labayen, et 
al. <em>vs</em>. Talisay-Silay Milling Co., 68 Phil., 376). 45843, June 30, 1939, L. J. Aug. 15, 1939). In seeking the annulment of the decision of Civil Case 
No. 833 (CA-G. R. No. 8085-R), the alleged fraud does not refer to jurisdiction, 
but to the admission by the trial court in said case of supposedly false or 
forged documents, which is intrinsic in character.</p>
<p>It appearing that the issue of prescription of action has not been mentioned 
by any of the parties in their briefs, the same is deemed abandoned.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order dated October 24, 1958, dismissing the complaint of 
Maria Aborde, with respect to Parcel III is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
the appellants.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, De Leon,</em> and <em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
