				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">These two appealed cases
present an identical question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
event that there are various letters of demand, should the o</span><span style="">ne</span><span style="">-</span><span style="">year </span><span style="">period in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suits be counted from the first or the last one sent the lessee?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases, the answer of the lower courts
was that it should be the latest that controls in accordance with what has
previously been held by us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no
occasion, therefore, to overrule them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These two appeals cannot prosper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

made defendants in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suits by the private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Pivgeth</span> Industries &amp; Development
Corp., owner of such building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The suits were filed on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="7"><span style="">July 21,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> in the <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> of respondent Judge Gregorio N. Garcia of the City
Court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both petitioners, as
defendants, moved to dismiss the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction
alleging that the first notice or demand to vacate was sent to them as far back
as April 27, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such motion to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction were denied by respondent Judge in view of the
fact that the final letter of demand or notice to vacate was in the case of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Oh sent on Sept. 30, 1966 and Lim Chi
on September 29, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the view
of the respondent Judge, therefore, in both cases that the suit was filed
clearly within the one-year period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This conclusion of respondent Judge Garcia was assailed in two
petitions for certiorari filed by each of the petitioners with the Court of
First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both petitions
failed, the jurisdiction of respondent Judge Garcia being sustained, the
decision in the case of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Oh being
rendered on May 10, 1968 by the Hon. Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>
and of petitioner Lim Chi being rendered by the Hon. Guillermo Santos on July
6, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence these appeals to us by the two
petitioners.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As above noted, we
affirm the respective decisions of Judges <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of respondent city court
Judge Garcia is immune from any such attack.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion arrived at in the above two cases of the lower
court judges finds support in adjudicated cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Racaza</span> v. Susana
Realty, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1966 decision, was cited by both judges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As was there held:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Moreover, even if the action were based on non­payment of rent,
the one-year period should be reckoned from the second notice, on the theory
that respondent has the right to waive his action based on the first demand and
to let the lessee remain in the premises." Judge Guillermo S. Santos
likewise relied on the even later opinion announced in <span class="SpellE">Calubayan</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Even assuming, for the sake
of argument, that the various notifi­cations for defendant to see the plaintiff
could be construed as demands upon the defendant to vacate, the length of time
that defendant detained the premises is to be reckoned with from the date of
the last demand."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Such a view has been
steadfastly adhered to by us ever since the 1913 opinion of <span class="SpellE">Lucido</span>
v. Vita.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> What would have been objectionable would
have been a departure <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by the lower
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, such a thought did
not occur to either Judge Santos or Judge <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They decided the matter before them
correctly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the above
indisputable controlling legal principle the assignment of alleged errors in
each of the two above cases made by the same counsel for both petitioners <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Oh and Lim Chi is distinguished only by its
futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No useful purpose would be
served by discussing each of them separately as the alleged grievance made much
of in all four errors assigned could be summed up in the asserted
inapplicability of the above decisions, announcing a principle to which there
has been unwavering adherence on our part.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The one-year period is to be counted from the last letter of demand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Necessarily then, any
attempt to distinguish the situation present in each of the above two cases is
far from persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, to crown
such an effort with success is to frustrate and defeat the basic objective
underlying the procedural rule on <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This resort to a technicality so
clearly apparent on its face and thus devoid of merit cannot possibly
succeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the summary</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">character
of</span> <span style="">unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
actions, which even now, through maneuvers of the lessees affected, may at
times be set at </span><span style="">naught, </span><span style="">vanishes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not for us to give the seal of our approval to any argument, even
if sought to be </span><span style="">clothed </span><span style="">with deceptive <span class="GramE">plausibility,
that</span> would contribute to such a far-from commendable result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision of the honorable Ricardo </span><span style="">C. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Puno</span></span><span style=""> of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="5"><span style="">May 10, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> in L-29328, and the decision of the
