of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission reversing the decision

  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> (RO-5,

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Benito Robles was employed by the res足pondent Republic

P4,188.00 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has been in the

optional retirement due to illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
or about March 4, 1975, or about 3 years from the date of his disability, he
filed his claim for disability compensation benefits before Regional Office No.

Physician's Report of Sickness or Accident (WCC Form No. 4) accom足plished by
his physician, Dr. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> of San Pablo City
certifying to the fact that petitioner was sick of Rheumatic Arthritis; that he

<p class="BODY">A hearing was conducted on the merits of the case before the
Hearing Officer of the Regional Office of San Pablo City and on July 30, 1975,
the Hearing Officer, Emilio de Villa rendered a decision granting the claimant
an accrued disability compensation benefits of P5,375.57 and a weekly compensation
of P48.32, starting August 1, 1975 until the total sum reaches P6,000.00, the
maximum compensation allowed by law.</p>

 22, 1975</st1:date>, respondent employer filed with the Hearing Officer of
Regional Office No. 5, <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration requesting

<p class="BODY">A close examination of the records failed to show any motion for
reconsideration filed by the respondent employer within the time requested for
filing said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
a certification was made on <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="12">December
 22, 1975</st1:date> by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> A. Enriquez, Acting

<p class="BODY">Surprisingly, however, on December 29, 1975, or exactly 4-1/2
months after receiving a copy of the decision of the Hearing Officer,
respondent employer filed with the respondent Commission a Petition to Elevate
Records for Relief from Judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
said petition, however, respondent employer admits that the decision in
question was not acted upon immediately or within the period required for a
motion for reconsideration and reasons out that:</p>

<blockquote>"The claim having been filed after retirement, and though having
gone on sick leaves of absence, claimant failed to mention the illnesses now
being complained of and which res足pondent came to know for the first time by
the filing of the instant claim, there is prejudice caused respondent which is
sufficient reason for the dismissal of the present claim on the ground of
prescription (<span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> School of Arts and Trade, RO1-WCC Case
No. 6148, November 22, 1973);</blockquote>

<blockquote>Arthritis without complications is not a basis for permanent
disability because pains in the joints are part of the aging process."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="6" year="1976">February 6, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> rendered a
decision reversing the decision of the Hearing Officer of Regional Office No.
5, <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and absolved the respondent employer of its liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition for review.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no more jurisdiction over the case
after the decision of the Hearing Officer of Regional Office No. 5, <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> became
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Ramos vs. Republic, L-41942, <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1976</st1:date>, this Court has already ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent commission's decision must be set aside for being
null and void for lack of jurisdiction and authority on its part to set aside
an award that was already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and had
even been duly endorsed for payment by the Government's counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since no appeal to the commission (by motion for reconsideration)
had been filed within the fifteen-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the referee's Award became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
upon the expiration of said deadline.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When respondent belatedly filed on <st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1975">January 23, 1975</st1:date> its Motion to Set Aside Award on the
ground of timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, respondent Commission
no longer had juris足diction to act on the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The award had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
and the referee, in denying the motion, no longer had authority to elevate the
record for the commission's review, as provided in cases of timely appeals, but
merely the ministerial duty to issue <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">propio</span> or on motion of the claimant the writ of execution
for enforcement of the award."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There can be no dispute in the instant
case that the decision of the Hearing Officer of Regional Office No. 5, <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> has
long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> almost 4 months when
the respondent employer filed its Petition to Elevate Records for Relief with
the respondent Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, however, claimed that under abnormal and extraordinary
circumstances, more particularly, the bulk of work assigned to the trial
attorney in the Office of the Solicitor General personally handling the case as
member of the Compensation Task Force of the Office of the Solicitor General
requiring her presence in the hearing of compensation cases at Regional Office
No. 5, Department of Labor, to beat the deadline set by the President for the
early disposition thereof, in addition to the interviews conducted by her
pursuant to Letter of Instructions No. 270, on the naturalization of deserving
aliens by Decree, it was humanly impossible for her, with the limited and
meager resources and personnel of the Office of the Solicitor General to
challenge the jurisdiction of the Acting Referee of Regional Office No. 5, San
Pablo City and show that the decision he rendered was contrary to the facts and
the law, within normal <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> periods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the records show that on <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1975">August 22, 1975</st1:date>, respondent employer
was able to file a motion for extension from <st1:date month="8" day="28" year="1975">August 28, 1975</st1:date> within which to file a motion for
reconsideration of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
did not respondent employer file any motion for reconsi足deration within the
extended period?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of filing a
motion for reconsideration, why did its counsel file a petition to elevate the
records for relief with the respondent Commission after the period of extension
within which to file a motion for reconsideration have long expired for four
and one-half (4-1/2) months after receipt of the decision?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled that mere pressure of work cannot be considered as a valid
excuse for not filing a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the
Acting Labor Referee.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the respondent Commission is
hereby reversed and set aside and that of the Acting Referee is hereby
reinstated with the modification that respondent Republic of the Philippines
(Bureau of Public Schools) is ordered to pay petitioner Benito Robles a

receipted for; his lawyer an attorney's fee in the amount of P600.00 and to pay
the corresponding administrative fee.</p>
