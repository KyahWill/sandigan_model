				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The above-entitled case (No. 41493 CFI Manila) waa instituted on September 
21, 1959 to secure the enforcement of a judgment rendered by the same court in 
Civil Case No. 3996, Philippine National Bank vs. William Gruenberg et al., 
dated August 12, 1949. This last judgment sentences defendant William Gruenberg 
to pay to the plaintiff Philippine National Bank, as trustee of Mrs. Salvacion 
Feria Vda. de Potenciano, the total amount of P7,000 as unpaid rentals 
corresponding to the months of September and October 1947 of the Lotus Theatre, 
plus F500 as liquidated damages. After the overruling of a motion to dismiss on 
January 30, 1960, defendant William Gruenberg, on February 11, 1960, presented 
an answer denying, for lack of knowledge or information sufficient to form a 
belief, the existence of the trust agreement or the existence of a judgment 
rendered against him in Civil Case No. 3996, As affirmative and special defenses 
he alleged that he was represented by counsel who filed the necessary answer to 
the complaint; that said counsel filed a motion seeking permission of the court 
to withdraw as counsel of the defendant; that the defendant was not notified of 
the resolution of the court on his counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel; that 
the proceedings held in said Civil Case No. 3996 are null and void for lack of 
valid notice of hearing on the merits to him as defendant,
<blockquote>
<p>"(4) That proceedings held in Civil Case No. 3996 are null and void for lack 
of valid notice of hearing on the merits of the case to the herein defendant in 
accordance with law, and, consequently the judgment in question, rendered 
therein, likewise null and void and of no legal effect and force." (p. 26, Rec. 
on Appeal).</p></blockquote>
<p>and that if the said proceedings were valid the decision has not become 
final, executory and enforceable for lack of proper and legal notice thereof to 
the defendant. Defendant also alleged that the action had already 
prescribed.</p>
<p>The court after hearing the case rendered judgment sentencing the defendants, 
under the terms and conditions mentioned in the judgment sought to be enforced, 
with legal interest from the date of the filing of the present complaint on the 
amounts due on the said judgment, plus costs.</p>
<p>On the issue as to whether or not there was notice of hearing given to 
defendant's counsel or himself, the court made the following findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Civil Case No. 3996, Philippine National Bank, trustee of Salvation Feria 
Vda. de Potenciano, vs. William Gruenberg, of which record this Court now takes 
judicial notice (1) Because anyway, the parties have invoked the proceedings in 
said case, (3 Moran, p. 31, 1952 Edition), defendants William Gruenberg and Jose 
Q. Tabora were represented by Atty. Delfin L. Gonzales; it was terminated on 
November 11, 1948, page 56 of the record, but Atty. Gonzales did not file any 
memorandum although he asked for time to do so, according' to page 67 of the 
record; the Court ordered the defendants there to file their respective 
memoranda by order of February 28, 1949, or else the case would be considered 
submitted for decision without benefit of memorandum, this order being on page 
70 of the record; notice of this order was served on William Gruenberg thru his 
wife Mercedes, according to the back of page 41; On August 12, 1949, the Court 
of First Instance thru the Hon. Judge Rafael Dinglasan issued its decision as 
shown on page 75 of the record in the slid case; again the copy of the decision 
was sent not to Atty. Gonzales but to defendant William Gruenberg, and according 
to the back of page 77 it was served on August 21, 1949 upon Agustina Belleza, a 
maid of William Gruenberg, in both cases, the Sheriff made the return that he 
served copies of the decision and the order upon a person of sufficient 
discretion to receive the same; On October 4, 1949, the Court issued an order 
granting the motion for a writ of execution against William Gruenberg and copy 
of this order, according to the back of page 80, was served upon William 
Gruenberg thru Mercedes Lam, a person living in the residence of said defendant 
and with sufficient discretion tw receive the same; this writ was not satisfied; * * *." (pp. 28-29, Record on Appeal.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the above findings of the court we find that the trial of the 
case was terminated on November 11, 1948. Atty. Gonzales for the appellant must 
have appeared at the time of the trial because the court found that he (Atty. 
Gonzales) asked for time "to do so," meaning to file a memorandum. It is true 
that a motion to withdraw was filed by Atty. Gonzales on December 24, 1947, but 
the said motion to withdraw was denied by the court in its order of July 27, 
1948 (Exh. "I-A" of the defendant). So that he must have continued to be present 
at the time of the trial, which was terminated on November 11, 1948. When the 
decision was rendered the same was served on Mrs. Gruenberg (plaintiff herein) 
on August 21, 1949.</p>
<p>The claim of defendant Gruenberg contained in his answer that defendant was 
not notified of the resolution for withdrawal and that there was no notice of 
the hearing on the merits of the case to him is without foundation both in fact 
and in law. At the time of the hearing Atty. Gonzales was still defendant's 
counsel because his motion to withdraw was denied. Notice of the hearing 
therefore must have been served upon said counsel. That he received notice and 
actually appeared at the hearing until its conclusion is shown by the fact that 
he even asked for time to file a memorandum, in accordance with the findings of 
the court below.</p>
<p>The decision also was served upon Gruenberg, the plaintiff herein, also in 
accordance with the rules. This is shown by Exhibits "I-C" and "I-E" of 
plaintiff and "I-B" of defendant.</p>
<p>In this court defendant-appellant claims that the judgment sought to be 
enforced is null and void for lack of valid notice of hearing of the case and of 
the rendition of said judgment, and that the action to enforce the judgment has 
already prescribed.</p>
<p>The facts stated in the decision of the court below and those set forth 
hereinabove, clearly show that plaintiff-appellant's counsel was notified, and 
appeared at the hearing of the case, and that defendant himself received a copy 
of the decision. His claim that the judgment is null and void for lack of notice 
to defendant or his counsel is without foundation in fact.</p>
<p>As to the second issue, we find that the judgment of the court dated August 
12, 1949 was served on defendantappellant Gruenberg on August 21, 1949 (Exhibits 
"I-C" and "I-E" of plaintiff and "I-B" of defendant). The right to enforce the 
judgment in the action started, therefore, on August 21, 1949, when 
defendant-appellant Gruenberg received copy of the decision. From said date, 
August 21, 1949 to the date of the, presentation of the complaint on September 
21, 1959, a period of only nine years and eleven months had passed. It should be 
noted that the judgment did not become final and effective until August 21, 
1949, when a copy of the said decision was furnished the defendant-appellant 
Gruenberg or his counsel. The date of the decision is not the effective date 
from which the period of ten years is to be counted, because said decision 
cannot be considered as binding on the defendant or any party for that matter, 
until after he (said defendant) or any party or his counsel had been furnished a 
copy thereof.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with 
costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,

Record on Appeal)<br></blockquote>In addition to the above findings of the court we find that the trial of the case was terminated on November 11, 1948. Atty. Gonzales for the appellant must have appeared at the time of the trial because the court found that he (Atty. Gonzales) asked for time "to do so," meaning to file a memorandum.

His claim that the judgment is null and void for lack of notice to defendant or his counsel is without foundation in fact.<br><br>As to the second issue, we find that the judgment of the court dated August 12, 1949 (Exhs. "I-C", "I-B" and "I-E" of defendant). The right to enforce the judgment in the action began to accrue, therefore, from the date of the expiration of the period of 30 days from August 21, 1949, this latter date being the date when the defendant-appellant Gruenberg received copy of the decision. The period within which defendant-appellant Gruenberg could appeal was perfected in accordance with Section 1 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. The judgment, therefore, became final and executory on September 21, 1949, which is the 31st day from August 22, 1949.<br><br>The action having accrued before the effectivity of the Civil Code of the Philippines, the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure apply, in accordance with the following provision of law:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 43. <span style="font-style: italic;">Other Civil Actions</span>.—<span style="font-style: italic;">How Limited</span>.—Civil Actions other than for the recovery of real property can only be brought within the following periods after the right of action accrues:<br><br>"1. Within ten years: An action upon an agreement, contract, or promise in writing, or upon the judgment or decree of a court; * * *."<br></blockquote>In accordance with the above section the last day within which the action to enforce the judgment was on September 20, 1959, but that day was a Sunday, so the action was properly filed the next day, September 21, 1959. Neither the date of the decision, nor the date of the service thereof, determines the time from which the action to enforce the judgment may be brought, but the day when the judgment became final and executory, because the action would not accrue until the same could be enforced in a court of justice.<br><br>Wherefore, in view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, C.
