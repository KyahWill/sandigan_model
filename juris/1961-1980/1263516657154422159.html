				<H3>GEORGE KALITAS, PETITIONER, VS. CATALINO LIDO
AND THE HON. JUDGE VICENTE CUSI, JR., JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner George <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> filed
suit in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> for the recovery
of possession of a portion of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>, which, he averred, was
being illegally occupied by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
Lido.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent denied the charge,
claiming that he was and is the owner of the portion in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended that although the portion was
included in the survey and registration of title in the name of the petitioner,
his ownership thereof was thereafter acknowledged by the petitioner in a public
instrument, annex "1" of the answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, he asked the court to order the petitioner to execute a
deed of cession of the said portion and to surrender his certificate of title
so that the necessary annotation could be made thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner in turn contended that the document on which the
respondent bases his claim is a nullity for three reasons: first, because it
contravenes the prohibition in the Public Land Law against the alienation of
lands within the period of five years; second, because it was not approved by
the governor (<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>) as required by the
Administrative Code for Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, and,
third, because it is without consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case came up for trial, the parties submitted the case on
the following agreed statement of facts:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on January 1, 1938, the plaintiff was
issued by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Homestead Patent
No. 46270 for a tract of land described in the complaint, by reason of which
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, issued Original
Certificate of Title No. 2119, dated March 18, 1938, to the plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1959</st1:date>, plaintiff was issued Original Certificate
of Title No. T-4970 by virtue of the cadastral proceedings for the same tract
of land;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the following are annotated at the back
of Original Certificate of Title No. 2119 in the name of George <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span>, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>”a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mortgage in favor of the Agricultural and
Industrial Bank dated <st1:date year="1941" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1941</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mortgage in favor of the R.F.C. dated <st1:date year="1951" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1951</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“c.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Release of both mortgages dated <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That both parties are brothers, belonging to
the Non-Christian tribe, called <span class="SpellE">Mandayas</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on January 29, 1940, George <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> exe­cuted the instrument marked as Annex '1' of the
answer, ratified before Notary Public Juan Naval of <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, copy of which is made an integral part of this
Stipulation of Facts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the instrument Annex '1' stated in the
next preceding paragraph does not show on its face approval of the Provincial
Governor;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the mother of both parties died in 1961,
ap­proximately two months previous to the filing of this complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the parcel of land in question,
containing an area of approximately 21,240 square meters, is presently occupied
by the defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Later, they submitted the following additional stipulation of
facts:</p>

<blockquote>"1. - That the
property in question produces 500 kilos of copra, more or less, every two
months;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. - That the
defendant was in possession of the property with his mother from 1940 up to the
time of the death of his mother and until the present time;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. - That the
right of the defendant pursuant to Annex '1' Of his answer is not annotated at
the back of Original Certificate No. 2119, nor at the back of Original
Certificate of Title No. T-4970, issued in the Cadastral proceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint
and ordering the annotation of the respondent's owner­ship on the certificate
of title of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its
decision the court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Annex 1 of the answer is neither a contract nor an agreement,
much less within the purview of the provisions quoted above of the Code of
Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For Annex 1 is merely an acknowledgment by George <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span>
that <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Lido, his brother, is the owner of the
land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a written
admission of Catalina Lido's ownership of the land therein described, together
with the improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But assuming that
Annex 1 were a contract of agreement contemplated by the Code, in the light of
the purpose of the law, however, it does not apply when the non-Christian is
literate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annex 1 which bears the
signature of George <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> very much shows that he
is not illiterate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is no
pretension whatsoever on his part that he were."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> received a copy of the decision
on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 4, following, he filed a motion
for new trial, offering to submit additional evidence purporting to show that
he allowed his brother, Lido, to stay on the land only during the life­time of
their mother and that the document of acknowledgment did not express his true
intention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> there was need to present additional evidence,
because "as matters now stand, this Honorable Court relied merely on the
insufficient facts so far stipulated on as it had no occasion to receive
evidences from both parties. "<span style="">In
support of his motion <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> invoked the last
paragraph of the stipulation of facts which reserved to the parties the right
to present "(such) additional evidence as may be necessary."</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion was denied by the court in its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12">Decem­ber 14, 1963</st1:date>, a copy of which
was received by <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> on the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1963</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> gave notice that he was
appealing "from the order of this Honorable Court … dated December 14,
1963," and, on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1964</st1:date>,
he submitted to the court for approval a record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place>Lido</st1:place> filed an opposition on the ground
that the appeal should have been taken not from the order of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1963</st1:date>, denying the
motion for new trial, because that order was interlocutory, but from the
decision on the merits, and that because of <span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span>'
fail­ure to do so, the decision became final on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, he moved for dismissal of the appeal, which the court granted
in its order of <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kalitas</span> moved for reconsideration and,
failing in this regard, filed the present petition for <i style=""><u>certiorari</u></i> and <i style="">mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's main grievance
is that the lower court denied him a new trial for the presentation of
additional evidence to support his claim that the instrument of acknowledgment
did not express his true intention as he does not even understand the lan­guage
(Spanish) in which it is written.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, the right to present additional evidence is expressly
reserved to him in the stipulation of facts which he and the respondent
submitted to the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner obviously misconceives the function of the
reservation clause in the stipulation of facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right to present evidence, in addition to an agreed statement of
facts, must be in­voked before the case is submitted to the court for
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner does not claim
that during the trial he offered to present evidence and that the court did not
allow him to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does he assert
that his failure to make use of his right was due to fraud, accident, mistake
or excusable neglect, or that the evidence he wanted to present constituted
newly-discovered evidence so as to entitle him to a new trial under Rule 37.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Rather, his claim is that he has a right to adduce additional evidence based on
the reservation made in the stipulation of facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the lower court correctly and properly denied his
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not of course to say
that the court could not reopen the case for the reception of additional
evidence, for it could.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
But whether it would was well within its discretion, and we are not prepared to
say that in denying the petitioner's motion the court acted capriciously or
whimsically.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, it is
contended that the petitioner had a right to appeal from the order denying him
new trial, under the second paragraph of section 2 of Rule 41 which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A judgment denying relief under Rule 38 is subject to appeal,
and in the course thereof, a party may also assail the judgment on the merits,
upon the ground that it is not supported by evidence or it is contrary to
law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Once more the petitioner is in error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule 38 provides re­lief from a final
judgment in cases where a party is deprived of a hearing because of fraud,
accident, mistake or excusable neg­lect.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule further provides that the petition for relief must be filed within
sixty days after the party learns of the judgment but not later than six months
after entry of the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
If the peti­tion is denied, the party may, according to the above-quoted pro­vision,
appeal from the order of denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it is plain that what the petitioner filed
was not a petition for relief under Rule 38, as the petition was not based on
any of the grounds, nor was it filed under the conditions, already stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was simply a motion to reopen the trial,
with the result that, upon its denial, the appeal should have been taken not
from the order denying the motion but rather from the judg­ment on the merits,
deducting the time during which the motion was pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus section 3 of Rule 41 provides:</p>

<blockquote>“<u>How appeal is taken</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Appeal may be taken by serving upon the adverse party and filing with
the trial court within thirty (30) days from notice of order or judgment, a
notice of appeal, an appeal bond, and a record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time during which a motion to set aside
the judgment or order or for a new trial has been pending shall be deducted,
unless such motion fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 37."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the petitioner received a copy of the trial court's deci­sion
on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1963</st1:date>, the
thirty-day period of appeal began to run on the following day until <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1963</st1:date> when he filed a
motion for new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A total of
twenty-seven days had thus passed, so that when the petitioner was notified on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1963</st1:date> of the denial of
his motion, he had only three days left for perfecting an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that he had only up to <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1963</st1:date> within which to
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that he filed a
notice of appeal on December 16, but as he did not submit a record on appeal
until <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1964</st1:date>, the
decision of the trial court be­came final on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court, therefore, did not err in dismissing his appeal.</p>
