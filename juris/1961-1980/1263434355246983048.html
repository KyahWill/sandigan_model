the plaintiff SAMPAGUITA PICTURES, INC. filed with the City Court of Quezon

judgment in favor of the Sampaguita Pictures, Inc., on June 8, 1965, ordering
the CAPITOL "300", Inc. to vacate the premises located at the
Sampaguita Building and to pay the Sampaguita Pictures, Inc.;</blockquote>

affidavit on the ground of its right and title to the possession of the items

possession over said items; that defendant filed a bond to indemnify the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1967</st1:date>,
based on said Stipulation of Facts, the lower court dismissed the complaint and
ordered Sampaguita to pay Jalwindor the amount of P500.00 as attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sampaguita filed a motion for
reconsideration which was like­wise denied, hence, the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant raised the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in holding that Capitol "300"
Inc. could not legally transfer or assign the glass and wooden jalousies in
question to the plaintiff-appellant.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in not holding that plaintiff-appellant
was the rightful owner of the glass and wooden jalousies when they were sold by
the Sheriff at the public auction.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in not declaring as null and void the
levy on execution and the Sheriff's sale at public auction of the glass and
wooden jalousies.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in holding that defendant-appellee
become the rightful owner of the glass and wooden jalousies."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the glass and wooden jalousies in question were delivered
and installed in the leased premises, Capitol became the owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ownership is not transferred by perfection of
the contract but by delivery, either actual or constructive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is true even if the purchase has been
made on credit, as in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Payment of the purchase price is not essential to the transfer of
ownership as long as the property sold has been delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ownership is acquired from the moment the
thing sold was delivered to vendee, as when it is placed in his control and
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Arts. 1477, 1496 and 1497,
Civil Code of the Phil.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Capitol entered into a lease contract with Sampaguita in 1964,
and the latter became the owner of the items in question by virtue of the
agreement in said contract "that all permanent improvements made by lessee
shall belong to the lessor and that said improvements have been considered as
part of the monthly rentals."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
levy or said items was made on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1965</st1:date>, Capitol, the judgment debtor, was no longer the owner
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action taken by Sampaguita to protect its interest is
sanctioned by Section 17, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 17.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Proceedings where property
claimed by third person.</span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'<span class="GramE">xxxx</span> The officer is not liable for
damages for the taking or keeping of the property to any third-party claimant
unless a claim is made by the latter and unless an action for damages is
brought by him against the officer within one hundred twenty (120) days from
the date of the filing of the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But
nothing herein contained shall prevent claimant or any third person from
vindicating his claim to the property by any action</u>.' "</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is, likewise, recognized in the case
of Bayer Phil., Inc. vs. Agana, et al., 63 SCRA 358, wherein the Court
declared, "that the rights of third party claimants over certain prop­erties
levied upon by the Sheriff to satisfy the judgment, may not be taken up in the
case where such claims are pre­sented but in a separate and independent action
instituted by claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxxx and should
a third-party appear to claim the property levied upon by the Sheriff and the
claim is denied, the remedy contemplated by the rules is the filing by said
party of a reivindicatory action against the execution creditor or the
purchaser of the property after the sale is completed or a complaint for
damages to be charged against the bond filed by the creditor in favor of the
sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span>.
Thus, when a property levied upon by the sheriff pursuant to a writ of
execution is claimed by a third person in a sworn statement of ownership
thereof, as prescribed by the rules, an entirely different matter calling for a
new adjudication arises."</p>

<p class="BODY">The items in question were illegally levied upon since they do
not belong to the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
power of the Court in execution of judgment extends only to properties
unquestionably belonging to the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Capitol failed to pay Jalwindor
the purchase price of the items levied upon did not prevent the transfer of
ownership to Capitol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint of
Sampaguita to nullify the Sheriff's sale is well-founded, and should
prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Execution sales affect the
rights of judgment debtor only, and the purchaser in the auction sale acquires
only the right as the debtor has at the time of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the items already belong to Sampaguita
and not to Capitol, the judgment debtor, the levy and auction sale are, accordingly,
null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled in
this jurisdiction that the sheriff is not authorized to attach property not
belonging to the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Arabay, Inc. vs. Salvador, et al., 3 PHILAJUR, 413 <i>[</i>1978<i>]</i>,
Herald Publishing vs. Ramos, 88 Phil. 94, 100).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed,
and plaintiff-appellant Sampaguita is declared the lawful owner of the disputed
glass and wooden jalousies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant-appellee Jalwindor is permanently enjoined from detaching said
items from the roofdeck of the Sampaguita Pictures Building, and is also
ordered to pay plaintiff-appellant the sum of P1,000.00 for and as attorney's
fees, and costs.</p>
