				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
Hon. Gustavo Victoriano, presiding, dated May 1, 1960, dismissing a combined 
petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span>, certiorari, prohibition and mandamus with 
preliminary injunction filed by petitioner-appellant Theodore Lewin against 
respondent-appellee Deportation Board.
<p>On December 2, 1959, the Special Prosecutors of the Department of Justice 
filed charges with the Deportation Board against said appellant Lewin (docketed 
as Deportation Case No. R-784), alleging therein that heiaiowingly engaged in 
illegal foreign exchange transactions in this country; that he maintained and 
still maintains casinos in Pasay City and other places; that in 1946, he was 
arrested and convicted by the municipal Court of Manila for maintaining a 
gambling joint in the Philippine Bank of Commerce building; that in 1959, he 
gave false testimony as to his criminal record in this country; that he is an 
undesirable alien whose presence in this country is inimical to public interest. 
The Special Prosecutors, therefore, prayed that the Board find appellant guilty 
of the charges and recommend his immediate deportation as an undesirable alien 
to the President of the Philippines. On the same date of the filing of the 
charges, and pursuant thereto, the Chairman of the Board issued a warrant for 
the arrest of appellant, and, consequently, he was confined in the NBI cell 
until December 3, 1959, when he was released on a bail bond of P25,000.</p>
<p>On December 26, 1959, after appellant was furnished a copy of the charges, he 
filed a motion to quash the same, alleging that the Board has no jurisdiction 
over his person and that the facts alleged do not constitute a valid and 
sufficient ground for his deportation. After an exchange of pleadings between 
the parties, the respondent-appellee Board resolved, after hearing, to deny the 
motion to quash. Not satisfied with the resolution of the Board, the appellant 
appealed to the President of the Philippines, who, in a letter dated January 27, 1960, dismissed the appeal and adopted the conclusions of the 
respondent-appellee Board.</p>
<p>Again on February 1, 1960, appellant filed another motion to quash and a 
motion for bill of particulars, and after an opposition thereto was filed by the 
Special Prosecutors, the Board, after hearing, denied both motions.</p>
<p>Consequently, on February 8, 1960, Lewin filed this combined petition for 
habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus with preliminary injunction with the Court 
of First Instance of Manila against the Deportation Board, wherein he alleged 
the proceedings that transpired in the respondent Board and he prayed for the 
issuance of a writ of (a) preliminary injunction directing the respondent Board 
to desist from hearing said Deportation Case No. R-784 against petitioner; (b) 
habeas corpus to require respondent Board to produce the body of the petitioner 
and, after due hearing, to order his discharge from custody; and (c) certiorari 
to require elevation to the Supreme Court of all the records of the case; and he 
also asked for a judgment commanding the respondent Board to desist from further 
proceeding with said deportation case, to declare the warrant of arrest issued 
against the petitioner null and void, and to order the cancellation and release 
of his bond.</p>
<p>A writ of preliminary injunction was issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> by the lower court on 
the same date of the filing of the petition.</p>
<p>On February 10, 1960, the respondent Board moved to dismiss the petition and 
to dissolve <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the trial 
court. In its motion, the respondent alleged that the trial court had no 
authority and jurisdiction to take cognizance of the petition, or to issue 
<span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> the writ; that the allegations of the petition are not tenable causes 
of action; that the issuance <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> of the writ upon a nominal bond is 
violative of the provisions of the Rules of Court and Canon 17 of Judicial 
Ethics.</p>
<p>Acting upon said motion and other pleadings subsequently filed by both 
parties, the lower court dismissed the petition of appellant Lewin and dissolved 
the writ of preliminary injunction. Hence this appeal.</p>
<p>In his appeal before this Court, petitioner-appellant Lewin assigned the 
following errors of the trial court, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING THE COMBINED PETITION FOR HABEAS CORPUS, 
CERTIORARI, PROHIBITION, AND MANDAMUS;</p><p> "THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DISSOLVING THE 
WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IT ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE' COMBINED 
PETITION FOR HABEAS CORPUS, CERTIORARI, PROHIBITION, AND MANDAMUS;</p>
<p>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN UPHOLDING THE LEGALITY AND CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE 
WARRANT OF ARREST ISSUED BY THE DEPORTATION BOARD, RESPONDENT-APPELLEE, AGAINST 
THE PETITIONER-APPELLANT IN CONNECTION WITH DEPORTATION CASE NO. 
R-784."</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 4, 1961, this Court directed appellant's counsel to show cause 
why the appeal should not be dismissed for being academic, inasmuch as the brief 
of the Solicitor General shows that appellant has left the Philippines and has 
not returned since then, and that he was admitted on a temporary visa only.</p>
<p>In compliance with said resolution, counsel for appellant manifested before 
this Court that the deportation case against appellant is still pending before 
the respondent Board; that the legal issue is precedent-setting and involves a 
relationship between this country and other countries, that this is not the 
first time this Court has resolved a case involving academic or moot issues. 
Appellant's counsel, therefore, prays that the case be given due course and 
decided on its merits.</p>
<p>The issues involved in this appeal are incidents of Deportation Case No. 784, 
which seeks to deport appellant Theodore Lewin from the Philippines as an 
undesirable alien.</p>
<p>In the brief of the Solicitor General in G. R. No. L-15253, entitled 
"Theodore Lewin vs. Galang, etc.", It is alleged and the same has not been 
controverted, that Lewin had entered this country only as a temporary visitor, 
to stay only 59 days. However, he prolonged his stay by securing extensions 
after extensions from the Cabinet, until the last extension which expired on 
January 26, 1959. Before the last extension expired, however, petitioner-appellant 
left country, upon his filing a bond, without assurance by the Board that he 
will be admitted upon his return. Said Lewin has not yet returned and is now 
living in another country. His voluntary departure from the country, his long 
absence therefrom and his status when he entered the country being only as a 
temporary visitor have rendered academic the question of his deportation as an 
undesirable alien. Even if the deportation case is to proceed and even if this 
Court will decide this appeal on the merits, there would be no practical value 
or effect of such action upon Lewin, because he has already left the country 
and is now beyond the legal processes of this country. Consequently, the issues 
involved herein have become moot and academic.</p>
<p>Consistent with our rulings that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. as a general rule it is not within the function of a court to act 
upon and decide a moot question or speculative, theoretical, or abstract 
question or proposition, or a purely academic question. * * *. </p>
<p>"The application of the rule that a court will not determine moot questions 
or abstract propositions has resulted in other expressions or rules to the 
effect that the court will not express an opinion in a case in which no 
practical relief can be granted, or which can have no practical effect; * * *.

<p>we hereby dismiss this appeal for the reason that the issues raised therein 
have become moot, academic and of no practical effect.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appeal prosecuted by petitioner Lewin is hereby dismissed.</p> <i>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</i>
