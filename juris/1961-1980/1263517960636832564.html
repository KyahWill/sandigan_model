				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal arising from the granting by the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (in Sp. Proc. No. C-9858) of the petition of
Josefina <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>
for change of their names to Josefina Hernandez and <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span>
Hernandez, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their amended petition filed in the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City),<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Josefina <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>
prayed for the change of their respective names to Josefina Hernandez and <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> Hernandez, upon allegations that they were both
of legal age, single and residents of San Francisco del Monte, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, at least 3 years prior to the filing of the
petition; that having elected Philippine citizenship on 7 February 1966, they
would like to use Filipino names by having their surnames "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>" changed to
"Hernandez", the surname that they have been using from the time they
started schooling until they finished their studies and went into employment,
and by which surname they have come to be known by everybody.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was opposed by the government, on the ground that
the reason adduced <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was not proper and
reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, judgment was
entered for the petitioners, and their surnames were decreed changed from
"<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>" to
"Hernandez", for all legal intents and purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is from this decision that the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">oppositor</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is appealing on the same issue of the propriety and reasonableness of the
ground for petitioners' action for change of their name.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court and supported by the evidence
presented during the hearing, petitioners' mother, Paz Sta. Ana, a Filipino
citizen, was the widow of one Jose Hernandez when she contracted marriage for
the second time on 13 September 1934, with Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, a Chinese.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Of this second marriage, two daughters were born:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Josefina <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, on <st1:date year="1935" day="19" month="3">19 March
 1935</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, on <st1:date year="1938" day="28" month="8">28 August
 1938</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In 1939, however, the spouses Paz and Alejandro agreed to live separately from
each other, with the two children remaining with the mother. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>When the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> girls, who allegedly were not told of their Chinese
forbear, reached the school age, they were enrolled at the F. Calderon
Elementary School in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> by one
of Paz's daughters by her first marriage, as "Josefina Hernandez" and
"<span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> Hernandez".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the report cards of these girls, their
mother signed herself, not as the widow of the Chinese Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> who was said to have
died in 1945,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
but as "Paz S. <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de Hernandez".<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
There is also record to show that Josefina <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> graduated from the <st1:place><st1:placename>Jose</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Abad</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename>

and obtained the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration from the
University of the East in 1955,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
as "Josefina B. Hernandez".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, she found employment, paid her income taxes, and exercised
voting privileges under the same name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For her part, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> presented proof that she
completed the secondary course in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Jose</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Abad</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename>

received the degree of Bachelor of Arts from the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in 1958,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and obtained employment,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
as "<span class="SpellE">Mercedita</span> Hernandez".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners had always been of the belief
that they were Filipinos until January, 1966, when their mother disclosed to
them that their father is a Chinese and their true surname is <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, petitioners executed statements
electing Philippine citizenship and took in the oath of <span class="SpellE">allegience</span>
to the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which papers were duly registered in the Civil Register of Manila on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="2">9 February 1966</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
following the Opinion of the Secretary of Justice allowing delayed registration
of elections of Philippine citizenship in certain meritorious cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="2">23 February 1966</st1:date>, the
present case was commenced in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no error in the decision of the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a ruling of long standing in this
jurisdiction that change of name is not a matter of right; that being a
privilege, before it can be authorized, the person petitioning for such change
must first show proper cause or compelling reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
And what may constitute as proper and compelling reason shall depend on the
particular circumstances of each case, and upon the discretion of the trial
court.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present proceeding, there is valid reason to justify the
continued use by petitioners of the names by which they have been known, and
with which they have always conducted, in good faith, their various social and
business activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notable is the
failure of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> to controvert petitioners'
claim that until January, 1966, they had no knowledge whatsoever that their
father is a Chinese and that their surnames properly should be <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, there is overwhelming
evidence that from childhood, petitioners have been carrying the family name,
"Hernandez"; that they finished their schooling and got employments,
voted in the local and national elec­tions, and paid their income taxes, under
that surname.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not difficult to
understand that for them to start using the family name "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>" at this time would
cause no little amount of confusion and trouble in the lives of these girls,
who do not appear to have any hand at all in creating the situation they now
find themselves in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, there is
nothing on the record to intimate that herein petitioners' use of the surname
“Hernandez” would cause damage or prejudice, either to the government or to any
other private party, including their mother's children by the first
marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as this Court has
succinctly declared, a mere change of name would not cause a change in one’s
existing family relations, nor create new family rights and duties where none
exists before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither would it affect a
person's legal capacity, civil status or citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would only be altered is the word or
group of words by which he is identi­fied and distinguished from the rest of
his fellow men.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, this court, in some meritorious cases, granted the applications of
naturalized Filipinos for change of their foreign names to Filipino-sounding
ones, in order that the handicap in their social and business dealings, Posed
by their alien names, may be removed and thus enable their full integration
into the Philippine society where they now belong.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
There is more compelling reason, therefore, for the granting of this petition and
allowing the use of Filipino names by herein petitioners, whose mother is a
Filipino, and who have been reared and schooled, and have actually lived, as
Filipinos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applicable to these petitioners is our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> vs. Republic, L-22712, <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="11">29 November 1965</st1:date>, 15 SCRA 457:</p>

<blockquote>"It has not been shown that petitioner has any fraudulent
intent in seeking a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
criminal, civil, tax or any other liability on his part, which he may avoid by
the change of name, has been suggested.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing has been presented to show any prejudice to the Government or to
any individual should the petition be granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of prejudice to the State or any individual, a sincere
desire to adopt a Filipino name to erase signs of former alien nationality
which unduly hamper social and business life, is a proper and reasonable cause
for a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not trivial,
whimsical or capricious."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Cas</span>. cit., 15 SCRA 460)</blockquote>

The Secretary of Justice had considered as appropriate ground for allowing the
late registration of election of citizenship papers the fact that the person
concerned has always believed himself to be a Filipino, he being born of a
Filipino mother who reared and educated him according to Filipino customs and
ways of life (Op. No. 367, s. 1951; Op. No. 136, s. 1951; also Op. No. 83, s.
1949.)</p>
