				<BR><STRONG>DE LEON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review on certiorari the decision of the Court of 
Appeals in CA—G. R. No. 15579-R affirming that of the Court of First Instance of 
Iloilo which sentenced petitioner Southern Lines, Inc. to pay respondent City of 
Iloilo the amount of P4,931.41.
<p>Sometime in 1948, the City of Iloilo requisitioned for rice from the National 
Rice and Corn Corporation (hereinafter referred to as NARIC) in Manila. On 
August 24 of the same year, NARIC, pursuant to the order, shipped 1,726 sacks of 
rice consigned to the City of Iloilo on board the SS "General Wright" belonging 
to the Southern Lines, Inc. Each sack of rice weighed 75 kilos and the entire 
shipment as indicated in the bill of lading had a total weight of 129,450 kilos. 
According to the bill of lading, the cost of the shipment was P63,115.50, 
itemized and computed as follows:</p>

<p>On September 3, 1948, the City of Iloilo received the shipment and paid the 
amount of P63,115.50. However, it was noted at the foot of the bill of lading 
that the City of Iloilo "Received the above mentioned merchandise apparently in 
same condition as when shipped, save as noted below: actually received 1685 
sacks with a gross weight of 116,131 kilos Upon actual weighing. Total shortage 
ascertained 13,319 kilos." The shortage was equivalent to 41 sacks of rice with 
a net weight of 13,319 kilos, the proportionate value of which was P6,486.35.</p>
<p>On February 14, 1951, the City of Iloilo filed a complaint in the Court of 
First Instance of Iloilo against NARIC and the Southern Lines, Inc. for the 
recovery of the amount of P6,486.35 representing the value of the shortage of 
the shipment of rice. After trial, the lower court absolved NARIC from the 
complaint, but sentenced the Southern Lines, Inc. to pay the amount of P4,931.41 
which is the difference between the sum of P6,486.35 and P1,554.94 representing 
the latter's counterclaim for handling and freight.</p>
<p>The Southern Lines, Inc. appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed 
the judgment of the trial court. Hence, this petition for review.</p>
<p>The only question to be determined in this petition is whether or not the 
defendant-carrier, the herein petitioner, is liable for the loss or shortage of 
the rice shipped.</p>
<p>Article 361 of the Code of Commerce provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 361.—The merchandise shall be transported at the risk and venture of 
the shipper, if the contrary has not been expressly stipulated.</p>
<p>As a consequence, all the losses and deteriorations which the goods may 
suffer during the transportation by reason of fortuitous event, force majeure, 
or the inherent nature and defect of the goods, shall be for the account and 
risk of the shipper.</p>
<p>Proof of these accidents is incumbent upon the carrier."</p></blockquote>
<p>Article 362 of the same Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 362.—Nevertheless, the carrier shall be liable for the losses and 
damages resulting from the causes mentioned in the preceding article if it is 
proved, as against him, that they arose through his negligence or by reason of 
his having failed to take the precautions which usage has established among 
careful persons, unless the shipper has committed fraud in the bill of lading, 
representing the goods to be of a kind or quality different from what they 
really were.</p>
<p>If, notwithstanding the precautions referred to in this article, the goods 
transported run the risk of being lost, on account of their nature or by reason 
of unavoidable accident, there being no time for their owners to dispose of 
them, the carrier may proceed to sell them, placing them for this purpose at the 
disposal of the judicial authority or of the officials designated by special 
provisions."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the provisions of Article 361, the defendantcarrier in order to free 
itself from liability, was only obliged to prove that the damages suffered by 
the goods were "by virtue of the nature or defect of the articles." Under the 
provisions of Article 362, the plaintiff, in order to hold the defendant liable, 
was obliged to prove that the damages to the goods by virtue of their nature, 
occurred on account of its negligence or because the defendant did not take the 
precaution adopted by careful persons. (Government vs. Ynchausti &amp; Co., 40 
Phil., 219, 223).</p>
<p>Petitioner claims exemption from liability by contending that the shortage in 
the shipment of rice was due to such factors as the shrinkage, leakage or 
spillage of the rice on account of the bad condition of the sacks at the time it 
received the same and the negligence of the agents of respondent City of Iloilo 
in receiving the shipment. The contention is untenable, for, if the fact of 
improper packing is known to the carrier or his servants, or apparent upon 
ordinary observation, but it accepts the goods notwithstanding, such condition, 
it is not relieved of liability for loss or injury resulting therefrom. (9 Am. 
Jur., 869.) Furthermore, according to the Court of Appeals, "appellant 
(petitioner) itself frankly admitted that the strings that tied the bags of rice 
were broken; some bags were with holes and plenty of rice were spilled inside 
the hull of the boat, and that the personnel of the boat collected no less than 
26 sacks of rice which they had distributed among themselves." This finding, 
which is binding upon this Court, shows that the shortage resulted from the 
negligence of petitioner.</p>
<p>Invoking the provisions of Article 366 of the Code of Commerce and those of 
the bill of lading, petitioner further contends that respondent is precluded 
from filing an action for damages on account of its failure to present a claim 
within 24 hours from receipt of the shipment. It alrso cites the cases of 
Government vs. Ynchausti &amp; Co., 24 Phil., 315 and Triton Insurance Co. vs. 
Jose, 33 Phil., 194, ruling to the effect that the requirement that the claim 
for damages must be made within 24 hours from delivery is a condition precedent 
to the accrual of the right of action to recover damages. These two cases 
above-cited are not applicable to the case at bar. In the first cited case, the 
plaintiff never presented any claim at all before filing the action. In the 
second case, there was payment of the transportation charges which precludes the 
presentation of any claim against the carrier. (See Article 366, Code of 
Commerce.) It is significant to note that in the American case of Hoye vs. 
Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 13 Ann. Cas. 414, it has been said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>". . . 'It has been held that a stipulation in the contract of shipment 
requiring the owner of the goods to present a notice of his claim to the carrier 
within a specified time after the goods have arrived at their destination is in 
the nature of a condition precedent to the owner's right to enforce a recovery, 
and that he must show in the first instance that he has complied with the 
condition, or that the circumstances were such that to have complied with it 
would have required him to do an unreasonable thing. <i>The weight of 
authority, howevert sustains the view that such a stipulation is more in the 
mature of a limitation upon the owner's right to recovery, and that the burden 
of proof is accordingly on the carrier to show that the. limitations was 
reasonable and in proper form or within the time stated.</i>'<i> </i>(Hutchinson on 
Carrier, 3rd ed., par. 447)." Italics Supplied.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case at bar, the record shows that petitioner failed to plead this 
defense in its answer to respondent's complaint and, therefore, the same is 
deemed waived (Section 10, Rule 9, Rules of Court) and cannot be raised for the 
first time at the trial or on appeal. (Maxilom vs. Tabotabo, 9 Phil., 390.) 
Moreover, as the Court of Appeals has said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * the records reveal that the appellee (respondent) filed the present 
action, within a reasonable time after the short delivery in the shipment of the 
rice was made. It should be recalled that the present action is one for the 
refund of the amount paid in excess, and not for damages or the recovery of the 
shortage; for admittedly the appellee (respondent) had paid the entire value of 
the 1726 sacks of rice, subject to subsequent adjustment, as to shortages or 
losses. The bill of lading does not at all limit the time for filing an action 
for the refund of money paid in excess."</p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed in all 
respects and the petition for certiorari denied. With costs against the petitioner.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, </i>and <i>Dizon, 
JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
