				<H3>PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PETITIONER, VS. HON. JUDGE JAVIER PABALAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE, BRANCH III, LA UNION, AGOO TOBACCO PLANTERS ASSOCIATION, INC., PHILIPPINE VIRGINIA TOBACCO ADMINISTRATION, AND PANFILO P. JIMENEZ, DEPUTY SHERIFF, LA UNION, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The reliance of petitioner Philippine 
National Bank in this <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition 
proceeding against respondent Judge Javier Pabalan who issued a writ of 
execution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
followed thereafter by a notice of garnishment of the funds of 
respondent Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 deposited with it, is on the fundamental constitutional law doctrine of
 non-suability of a state, it being alleged that such funds are public 
in character.  This is not the first time petitioner raised that issue. 
 It did so before in <em>Philippine National Bank v. Court of 
Industrial Relations</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 decided only last January.  It did not meet with success, this Court 
ruling in accordance with the two previous cases of National Shipyard 
and Steel Corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and <em>Manila Hotel Employees Association
 v. Manila Hotel Company</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 that funds of public corporations which can sue and be sued were not 
exempt from garnishment.  As respondent Philippine Virginia Tobacco 
Administration is likewise a public corporation possessed of the same 
attributes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> a 
similar outcome is indicated.  This petition must be dismissed.
<p>It is undisputed that the judgment against respondent 
Philippine 
Virginia Tobacco Administration had reached the stage of finality.  A 
writ of execution was, therefore, in order.  It was accordingly issued 
on December 17, 1970.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> There was a notice of garnishment for the full 
amount mentioned in such writ of execution in the sum of P12, 
724.66.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 In view of the objection, however, by petitioner Philippine National 
Bank on the above ground, coupled with an inquiry as to whether or not 
respondent Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration had funds 
deposited with petitioner's La Union branch, it was not until January 
25, 1971 that the order sought to be set aside in this 
<em>certiorari</em> proceeding was issued by respondent 
Judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 Its dispositive portion reads as follows: "Conformably with the 
foregoing, it is now ordered, in accordance with law, that sufficient 
funds of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration now deposited 
with the Philippine National Bank, La Union Branch, shall be garnished 
and delivered to the plaintiff immediately to satisfy the Writ of 
Execution for one-half of the amount awarded in the decision of November
 16, 1970."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  
Hence this <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition proceeding.
</p><p>As noted at the outset, petitioner Philippine 
National Bank would
 invoke the doctrine of non-suability.  It is to be admitted that under 
the present Constitution, what was formerly implicit as a fundamental 
doctrine in constitutional law has been set forth in express terms: "The
 State may not be sued without its consent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 If the funds appertained to one of the regular departments or offices 
in the government, then, certainly, such a provision would be a bar to 
garnishment.  Such is not the case here.  Garnishment would lie.  Only 
last January, as noted in the opening paragraph of this decision, this 
Court, in a case brought by the same petitioner precisely invoking such a
 doctrine, left no doubt that the funds of public corporations could 
properly be made the object of a notice of garnishment.  Accordingly, 
this petition must fail.
</p><p>1. The alleged grave abuse of discretion, the basis 
of this <em>certiorari</em>
 proceeding, was sought to be justified on the failure of respondent 
Judge to set aside the notice of garnishment of funds belonging to 
respondent Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration.  This excerpt 
from the aforecited decision of <em>Philippine National Bank v. 
Court of Industrial Relations</em>
 makes manifest why such an argument is far from persuasive: "The 
premise that the funds could be spoken of as public in character may be 
accepted in the sense that the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation
 was a government-owned entity.  It does not follow though that they 
were exempt from garnishment.  <em>National Shipyard and Steel 
Corporation v. Court of Industrial Relations</em>
 is squarely in point.  As was explicitly stated in the opinion of the 
then Justice, later Chief Justice, Concepcion: 'The allegation to the 
effect that the funds of the NASSCO are public funds of the government, 
and that, as such, the same may not be garnished, attached or levied 
upon, is untenable for, as a government-owned and controlled 
corporation, the NASSCO has a personality of its own, distinct and 
separate from that of the Government.  It has — pursuant to Section 2 of
 Executive Order No. 356, dated October 23, 1950 * * *, pursuant to 
which the NASSCO has been established — "all the powers of a corporation
 under the Corporation Law. . . ." Accordingly, it may sue and be sued 
and may be subjected to court processes just like any other corporation 
(Section 13, Act No. 1459, as amended.)' . . . To repeat, the ruling was
 the appropriate remedy for the prevailing party which could proceed 
against the funds of a corporate entity even if owned or controlled by 
the government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
</p><p>2. The National Shipyard and Steel Corporation 
decision was not 
the first of its kind.  The ruling therein could be inferred from the 
judgment announced in <em>Manila Hotel Employees Association v. 
Manila Hotel Company</em>, decided as far back as 1941.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In the language of 
its <em>ponente</em>,
 Justice Ozaeta: "On the other hand, it is well-settled that when the 
government enters into commercial business, it abandons its sovereign 
capacity and is to be treated like any other corporation.  
(<em>Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank</em>,
 9 Wheat. 904, 6 L. ed. 244).  By engaging in a particular business thru
 the instrumentality of a corporation, the government divests itself 
<em>pro hac vice</em> of its sovereign character, so as to 
render the corporation subject to the rules of law governing private 
corporations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 It is worth mentioning that Justice Ozaeta could find support for such a
 pronouncement from the leading American Supreme Court case of 
<em>United States v. Planters' Bank</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 with the opinion coming from the illustrious Chief Justice Marshall.  
It was handed down more than one hundred fifty years ago, 1824 to be 
exact.  It is apparent, therefore, that petitioner Bank could not 
legally set forth as a bar or impediment to a notice of garnishment the 
doctrine of non-suability.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, this petition
 for <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition is dismissed.  No 
costs.
</p><p><em>Barredo, Antonio, Aquino</em>, and 
<em>Santos, JJ.</em>, concur.
</p><p><em>Concepcion, J.</em>, on leave.
