				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioners States Marine Corporation and Royal Line, Inc. were engaged in 
the business of marine coastwise transportation, employing therein several 
steamships of Philippine registry. They had a collective bargaining contract 
with the respondent Cebu Seamen's Association, Inc. On September 12, 1952, the 
respondent union filed with the Court of Industrial Relations (C.I.R.), a 
petition (Case No. 740-V) against the States Marine Corporation, later amended 
on May 4, 1953, by including as party respondent, the petitioner Royal Line, 
Inc. The Union alleged that the officers and men working on board the 
petitioners' vessels have not been paid their sick leave, vacation leave and 
overtime pay; that the petitioners threatened or coerced them to accept a 
reduction of salaries, observed by other shipowners; that after the Minimum Wage 
Law had taken effect, the petitioners required their employees on board their 
vessels, to pay the sum of P.40 for every meal, while the masters and officers 
were not required to pay their meals and that because Captain Carlos Asensi had 
refused to yield to the general reduction of salaries, the petitioners dismissed 
said captain who now claims for reinstatement and the payment of back wages from 
December 25, 1952, at the rate of P540.00, monthly. </p>
<p>The petitioners' shipping companies, answering, averred that very much below 
30 of the men and officers in their employ were members of the respondent union; 
that the work on board a vessel is one of comparative case; that petitioners 
have suffered financial losses in the operation of their vessels and that there 
is no law which provides for the payment of sick leave or vacation leave to 
employees or workers of private firms; that as regards the claim for overtime 
pay, the petitioners have always observed the provisions of Comm. Act No. 444, 
(Eight Hour Labor Law), notwithstanding the fact that it does not apply to those 
who provide means of transportation; that the shipowners and operators in Cebu 
were paying the salaries of their officers and men, depending upon the margin of 
profits they could realize and other factors or circumstances of the business; 
that in enacting Rep. Act No. 602 (Minimum Wage Law), the Congress had in mind 
that the amount of P.40 per meal, furnished the employees should be deducted 
from the daily wages; that Captain Asensi was not dismissed for alleged union 
activities, but with the expiration of the term of the contract between said 
officer and the petitioners, his services were terminated.</p>
<p>A decision was rendered on February 21, 1957 in favor of the respondent 
union. The motion for reconsideration thereof, having been denied, the companies 
filed the present writ of certiorari, to resolve legal questions involved. 
Always bearing mind the deep-rooted principle that the factual findings of the 
Court of Industrial Relations should not be disturbed, if supported by 
substantial evidence, the different issues are taken up, in the order they are 
raised in the brief for the petitioners. </p>
<p>1. <em>First assignment of error.</em>—The respondent court erred in holding 
that it had jurisdiction over case No. 740-V, notwithstanding the fact that 
those who had dispute with the petitioners, were less than thirty (30) in 
number.</p>
<p>The CIR made a finding that at the time of the filing of the petition in case 
No. 740-V, respondent Union had more than thirty members actually working with 
the companies, and the court declared itself with jurisdiction to take 
cognizance of the case. Against this order, the herein petitioner did not file a 
motion for reconsideration or a petition for certiorari. The finding of fact 
made by the CIR became final and conclusive, which we are not now authorized to 
alter or modify. It is axiomatic that once the CIR had acquired jurisdiction 
over a case, it continues to have that jurisdiction, until the case is 
terminated (Manila Hotel Emp. Association <i>vs.</i> Manila Hotel Company) et 
al., 40 Off. Gaz. No. 6, p. 3027). It was abundantly shown that there were 56 
members who signed Exhibits A, A-1 to A-8, and that 103 members of the Union are 
listed in Exhibits B, B-1 to B-35, F, F-1 and K-12 to K-3. So that at the time 
of the filing of the petition, the respondent union had a total membership of 
159, working with the herein petitioners, who were presumed interested in or 
would be benefited by the outcome of the case (NAMARCO <i>vs.</i> CIR, L-17804, 
Jan. 1963). Annex D, (Order of the CIR, dated March 8, 1954), likewise belies 
the contention of herein, petitioner in this regard. The fact that only 7 
claimed for overtime pay and only 7 witnesses testified, does not warrant the 
conclusion that the employees who had some dispute with the present petitioners 
were less than 30. The ruling of the CIR, with respect to the question of 
jurisdiction is, therefore, correct.</p>
<p>2. <em>Second assignment of error.</em>—The CIR erred in holding, that 
inasmuch as in the shipping articles, the herein petitioners have bound 
themselves to supply the crew with provisions and with such "daily subsistence 
as shall be mutually agreed upon" between the master and the crew, no deductions 
for meals could be made by the aforesaid petitioners from their wages or 
salaries. </p>
<p>3. <em>Third assignment of error</em>.—The CIR erred in holding that inasmuch 
as with regards to meals furnished to crew members of a vessel, section 3 (f) of 
Act No. 602 is the general rule, while section 19 thereof is the exception, the 
cost of said meals may not be legally deducted from the wages or salaries of the 
aforesaid crew members by the herein petitioners. </p>
<p>4. <em>Fourth assignment of error.</em>—The CIR erred in declaring that the 
deduction for costs of meals from the wages or salaries after August 4, 1951, is 
illegal and same should be reimbursed to the employee concerned, in spite of 
said section 3, par. (f) of Act No. 602.</p>
<p>It was shown, by substantial evidence, that since the beginning of the 
operation of the petitioner's business, all the crew of their vessels have been 
signing "shipping articles" in which are stated opposite their names, the 
salaries or wages they would receive. All seamen, whether members of the crew or 
deck officers or engineers, have been furnished free meals by the ship owners or 
operators. All the shipping articles signed by the master and the crew members, 
contained, among others, a stipulation, that "in consideration of which services 
to be duly performed, the said master hereby agrees to pay to the said crew, as 
wages, the sums against their names respectively expressed in the contract; and 
to supply them with provisions as provided here in * * *" (Sec. 8, par. [b], 
shipping articles), and during the duration of the contract" the master of the 
vessel will provide each member of the crew such daily subsistence as shall be 
mutually agreed, upon between said master and crew; or, in lieu of such 
subsistence the crew may reserve the right to demand at the time of execution of 
these articles that adequate <em>daily rations</em> be furnished each member of 
the crew." (Sec. 8, par. [e]. shipping articles). It is, therefore, apparent 
that, aside from the payment of the respective salaries or wages, set opposite 
the names of the crew members, the petitioners bound themselves to supply the 
crew with ship's provisions, daily subsistence or daily rations, which include 
food. </p>
<p>This was the situation before August 4, 1951, when the Minimum Wage Law, 
became effective. After this date, however, the companies began deducting the 
cost of meals from the wages or salaries of crew members; but no such deductions 
were made from the salaries of the deck officers and engineers in all the boats 
of the petitioners. Under the existing laws, therefore, the query converges on 
the legality of such deductions. While the petitioners herein contend that the 
deduction are legal and should not be reimbursed to the respondent union, the 
latter, however, claims that same are illegal, and reimbursement should be made. 
</p>
<p>We hold that such deductions are not authorized. In the coastwise business of 
transportation of passengers and freight, the men who compose the complement of 
a vessel are provided with free meals by the shipowners, operators or agents, 
because they hold on to their work and duties, regardless of "the stress and 
strain concommitant of a bad weather, unmindful of the dangers that lurk ahead 
in the midst of the high seas." </p>
<p>Section 3, par., f, of the Minimum Wage Law, (R.A. No. 602), provides as 
follows—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" '(f) Until and unless investigations by the Secretary of Labor on his 
initiative or on petition of any interested party result in a different 
determination of the fair and reasonable value, the <i>furnishing of meals</i> 
shall be valued at not more than thirty centavos per meal for agricultural 
employees <i>and not more than forty centavos for any, other employees covered 
by this Act</i>, and the furnishing of housing shall be valued at not more than 
twenty eentavos daily for agricultural workers and not more than forty centavos 
daily for other employees covered by this Act.' "</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioners maintain, in view of the above provisions, that in fixing the 
minimum wage of employees, Congress took into account the meals furnished by 
employers .and that in fixing the rate of forty centavos per meal, the 
law-makers had in mind that the latter amount should be deducted from the daily 
wage, otherwise, no rate for meals should have been provided. </p>
<p>However, section 19, same law, states— </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 19. <i>Relations to other labor laws and practices.—Nothing in this Act 
</i>shall deprive an employee of the right to seek fair wages, shorter working 
hours and better working conditions nor<i> justify an employer </i>in violating 
any other labor law applicable to his employees<i>, in reducing the wage now 
paid to any of has employees in excess of the minimum wage established under 
this Act, or in reducing supplements furnished on the date of 
enacment."</i></p></blockquote>
<p>At first blush, it would appear that there exists a contradiction between the 
provisions of section 3(f) and section 19, of Rep. Act No. 602; but from a 
careful examination of the same, it is evident that section 3 (f) constitutes 
the general rule, while section 19, is the exception. In other words, if there 
are no supplements given, within the meaning and contemplation of section 19, 
but merely facilities, section 3(f) governs. There is no conflict; the two 
provisions could, as they should be harmonized. And even if there is such a 
conflict, the respondent CIR, should resolve the same, in favor of the safety 
and decent living of laborers (Art. 1702, new Civil Code). </p>
<p>It is argued that the food or meals given to the deck officers, marine 
engineers and unlicensed crew members in question, were mere "facilities" which 
should be deducted from wages, and not "supplements" which, according to said 
section 19, should not be deducted from such wages, because it is provided 
therein: "Nothing in this Act shall deprive an employee of the right to such 
fair wage * * * or <em>in reducing supplements</em> furnished on the date of 
enactment." In the case of Atok-Big Wedge Assn. <i>vs.</i> Atok-Big Wedge Co., 
97 Phil., 294; 51 Off. Gaz. 3432, the two terms are defined as follows—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'Supplements', therefore, constitute extra remuneration or special 
privileges or benefits given to or received by the laborers <i>over</i> and 
<i>above their ordinary earnings or wages,</i> 'Facilities', on the other hand, 
are items of expense necessary for the laborer's and his family's existence and 
subsistence, so that by express provision of law (Sec. 2 [g], they form part of 
the wage and when furnished by the employer are deductible therefrom, since if 
they are not so furnished, the laborer would spend and pay for them just the 
same." </p></blockquote>
<p>In short, the benefit or privilege given to the employee which constitutes an 
extra remuneration above and over his basic or ordinary earning or wage, is 
supplement; and when said benefit or privilege is part of the laborers' basic 
wages, it is a facility. The criterion is not so much with the kind of the 
benefit or item (food, lodging, bonus or sick leave, given, but its purpose. 
Considering, therefore, as definitely found by the respondent court that the 
meals were freely given to crew members prior to August 4, 1951, while they were 
on the high seas "not as part of their wages but as a necessary matter in the 
maintenance of the health and efficiency of the crew personnel during the 
voyage", the deductions therein made for the meals given after August 4, 1951, 
should be returned to them, and the operator of the coastwise vessels affected, 
should continue giving the same benefit. </p>
<p>In the case of Cebu Autobus Company <i>vs.</i> United Cebu Autobus Employees 
Assn., L-9742, Oct. 27, 1955, the company used to pay to its drivers and 
conductors, who were assigned outside of the City limits, aside from their 
regular salary, a certain percentage of their daily wage, as allowance for food. 
Upon the effectivity of the Minimum Wage Law, however, that privilege was 
Stopped by the company. The order of the CIR to the company to continue granting 
this privilege, was upheld by this Court. </p>
<p>The shipping companies argue that the furnishing of meals to the crew before 
the effectivity of Rep. Act No. 602, is of no moment, because such circumstance 
was already taken into Consideration by Congress, when it stated that "wage" 
includes the fair and reasonable value of boards customarily furnished by the 
employer, to the employees. If we are to follow the theory of the herein 
petitioners, then a crew member, who used to receive a monthly wage of P100.00, 
before August 4, 1951, with no deduction for meals, after said date, would 
receive only P86.00 monthly (after deducting the cost of his meals at P.40 per 
meal), which would be very much less than the P122.00 monthly minimum wage, 
fixed in accordance with the Minimum Wage Law. Instead of benefitting him, the 
law will adversely affect said crew member. Such interpretation does not conform 
with the avowed intention of Congress in enacting the said law. </p>
<p>One should not overlook a fact fully established, that only unlicensed crew 
members were made to pay for their meals or food, while the deck officers and 
marine engineers receiving higher pay and provided with better victuals, were 
not. This pictures in no uncertain terms, a great and unjust discrimination 
obtaining in the present case (Pambujan Sur United Mine Workers <i>vs.</i> CIR, 
et al., 51 Off. Gaz. [6] 2894). </p>
<p><em>Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Assignments or Errors</em>.—The CIR erred in 
holding that Severino Pepito, a boatsman, had rendered overtime work, 
notwithstanding the provisions of section 1 of C.A. No. 444; in basing its 
finding of the alleged overtime, on the uncorroborated testimony of said 
Severino Pepito; and in ordering the herein petitioners to pay him.</p>
<p>Severino Pepito was found by the CIR to have worked overtime and had not been 
paid for such services. Severino Pepito categorically stated that he worked 
during the late hours of the evening and during the early hours of the day when 
the boat docks and unloads. Aside from the above, he did other jobs such as 
removing rusts and cleaning the vessel, which overtime work totalled to 6 hours 
a day, and of which he had not been paid as yet. This statement was not rebutted 
by the petitioners. Nobody working with him on the same boat "M/V Adriana" 
testified contrariwise. The testimonies of boatswains, of other vessels (M/V 
Iruna and M/V Princesa), are incompetent and "unreliable. And considering the 
established fact that the work of Severino Pepito was continuous, and during the 
time he was not working, he could not leave and could not completely rest, 
because of tne place and nature of his work, the provisions of sec. 1, of Comm. 
Act No. 444, which states "When the work is not continuous, the time during 
which the laborer is not working and can leave his working place and can rest 
completely shall not be counted", find no application in his case. </p>
<p>8. <em>Eight assignment of error.</em>—The CIR erred in ordering petitioners 
to reinstate Capt. Carlos Asensi to his former position, considering the fact 
that said officer had been employed since January 9, 1953, as captain of a 
vessel belonging to another shipping firm in the City Of Cebu. The CIR held—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Finding that the claims of Captain Carlos Asensi for back salaries from that 
time of his alleged layoff on March 20, 1952, is not supported by the evidence 
on record, the same is hereby dismissed. Considering, however, that Captain 
Asensi had been laid-off for a long time and that his failure to report for work 
is not sufficient cause for his absolute dismissal, respondents are hereby 
ordered to reinstate him to his former job without back salary but under the 
same terms and conditions of employment existing prior to his lay-off, without 
loss of seniority and other benefits already acquired by him prior to March 20, 
1952, This Court is empowered to reduce the punishment meted out to an erring 
employee (Standard Vacuum Oil Co., Inc. <i>vs.</i> Katipunan Labor Union, G.R. 
No. L-9666, Jan. 30, 1967). This step taken is in consonance with section 12 of 
Comm. Act 103, as amended." (p. 16, Decision, Annex 'G')". </p></blockquote>
<p><em>Ninth and Tenth assignments of error.</em>—The CIR erred in denying a 
duly verified motion for new trial, and in overruling petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration. </p>
<p>The motion for new trial, supported by an affidavit, states that the movants 
have a good and valid defense and the same is based on three orders of the WAS 
(Wage Administration Service), dated November 6, 1966. It is alleged that they 
would inevitably affect the defense of the petitioners. The motion for new trial 
is without merit. Having the said wage Orders in their possession, while the 
case was pending decision, it was not explained why the proper move was not 
taken to introduce them before the decision was promulgated. The said wage 
orders, dealing as they do, with the <i>evaluation of meals and facilities</i>, 
are irrelevant to the present issue, it having been found and held that the 
meals or food in question are not facilities but supplements. The original 
petition in the CIR having been filed on Sept. 12, 1952, the WAS could have 
intervened in the manner provided by law to express its views on the matter. At 
any rate the admission of the three wage orders could not have altered the 
decision reached in this case. </p>
<p>In view hereof, the petition is dismissed, with costs against the 
petitioners. </p>
