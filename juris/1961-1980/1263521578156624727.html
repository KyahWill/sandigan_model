				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original action for a writ of mandamus directing res­pondent
judge to order the docketing by respondent clerk of court of 193 verified
petitions for exclusion of more than 6, 000 alleged­ly fictitious voters in
Pasay City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court grants the
petition and orders that said petitions be forthwith heard and resolved be­fore
election day, November 8, 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">214 verified exclusion petitions were concededly sought to be filed
with respondent clerk during office hours of October 19, 1971, the last of the
10-day period from October 9, 1971 (the date fixed by the Commission on
Elections under section 240 of the Election Code of 1971, Republic Act No.
6388, for registration of voters before the precinct boards of inspectors)
within which to file inclusion/exclusion petitions under section 118 of the new
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitions were first presented for filing at 1:30 p. m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were prepared and filed after a
house-to-house canvass con­ducted by the Pasay Citizens League for Good
Government and the <u>Progresibong Kabataan ng Pasay</u>, duly authorized,
according to the petitions, by the Comelec for the purpose of ferreting out
from the voters' lists "fictitious or non-existing persons." What
transpired thereafter, even going by the allegations of respondents' answer,
was that the receiving clerk of respondent court refused to accept the
petitions for filing on the ground that they "were not ac­companied by
proof of notice of service of the petitions to the parties, as required by
law." When petitioners' counsel brought the matter to the respondent
clerk's attention, the latter "suggested to Atty. Dizon (petitioners'
counsel) that while there was still time, it would be to their own advantage to
attach the required proof of service of notice to the parties, as required by
law, otherwise, even if accept­ed for filing, the Court may dismiss the
petitions."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">According to respondent clerk, "(B)elieving in the sound­ness
of this suggestions, Atty. Dizon agreed, left and returned at about 3:30 p. m. <u>with
an affidavit which he claimed was to serve as<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the proof of service for all the petitions numbering 214 separate<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petitions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Clerk of Court Sta. Ana opined that the
said affidavit did not conform to the substantial requirements of the election
law</u>, and <u>suggested to Atty. Dizon to prepare a separate affidavit for
each of the petitions for exclusion, to conform to the substantial require­ments
of the Election Code</u>, to which suggestion Atty. Dizon agreed.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioners' counsel returned at 4:07 p. m. with
affidavits of proof of service for each of the 214 petitions, which he
feverishly sorted and stapled to each of the petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent clerk then directed his receiving
clerk to docket the petitions but only a total of 21 petitions could be
received and stamped as of 4:45 p. m. and 5:00 p. m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 5:00 p.m., respondent clerk ordered the
docketing of the petitions stopped and the closing of his office, since
according to him, lawyers of the Nacionalista and Liberal parties enjoined him
not to receive any further petitions in violation of section, 139-a of the new
Code which enjoins that "(O)utside of the regular office hours, no
application for inclusion or exclusion of voters shall be received."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' representations with respondent judge, as exe­cutive
judge of respondent court, (personally at the first hour of October 20, 1971
and formally in writing on October 22, 1971) to direct respondent clerk to
docket the remaining 193 petitions which had been left undocketed, met with no
success.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the filing of the present petition on October 23, 1971,
hearing of which was held on October 28, 1971, due to the urgency thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the writ of mandamus should issue as prayed
for, by virtue of the following considerations:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The 214 verified petitions were duly and timely
pre­sented for filing to respondent clerk of court during the regular office
hours of October 19, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
it was the minis­terial duty of respondent clerk of court to receive the
petitions and to have them duly docketed as of then, even though the physical
work of docketing the petitions and affixing the docket numbers thereon may
extend beyond the close of office hours.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prohi­bition of the Code against <u>receipt</u> of
exclusion/inclusion petitions "outside of the regular office hours"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
was clearly inapplicable, for here, the petitions were <u>duly presented for
receipt and filing</u> during regular office hours, and it was merely the
physical work of docketing them - due to the great number of petitions - that
had to extend after office hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To so
docket them is merely to comply with the clear intent and spirit of the cited
legal provision.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->It was clearly officious on the part of
respondent clerk to suggest or require that petitioners' counsel attach to the
214 petitions a separate affidavit of service of notice for each of the
petitions, by way of proof of notice as mentioned in section 137 of the new
Code<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>,
as "otherwise, even if accepted for filing, the Court may dismiss the
petitions."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Prescinding from the fact that the verified petitions each carried in paragraph
5 thereof the equi­valent of proof of notice (although not in ideally precise
and accurate terms),<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and therefore the separate individual affidavits of service of notice required
by respondent clerk of court might be deemed a surplusage, respondent clerk
could not likewise officiously arro­gate unto himself the prerogative of
passing upon the sufficiency and validity of the proof of notice incorporated
in the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His was the ministerial
function, particularly in election cases, of re­ceiving the petitions and
docketing the same, instead of raising the alleged defects in form or substance
which delayed and prevented the docketing during office hours of the petitions,
to the prejudice of the public interest involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judicial power to rule upon such alleged
defects of the petitions, specifically insufficiency of notice on the parties
concerned, is vested in respondent court, which is called upon to rule thereon
at the hearing, <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u> or at the adverse party's instance.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Since respondent clerk of court failed to
discharge his ministerial duty of receiving and docketing the petitions, it
clearly devolved upon respondent judge as a ministerial function, upon his
attention having been duly called thereto, to order respondent clerk to docket
the petitions.</p>

leaving 193 petitions undocketed which could not be heard on October 25, 1971,

raffled forthwith among the various branches of the Court of First Instance of
Pasay City and notice of hearing caused to be given expeditiously only by
personal delivery to the voters named as respondents in the petitions or by
