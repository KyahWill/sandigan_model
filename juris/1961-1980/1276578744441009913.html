				<BR><BR><p>Review of the decision of the Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro, in 
its Criminal Case No. R-1788, for multiple murder, sentencing the accused, 
Arnulfo Estabaya, to the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and imposing on the 
other accused, Felix Magpantay and Eugenio Alcaraz, the death penalty; ordering 
them to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of each of the ten deceased 
persons named in the information the sum of P6,000.00, and to pay the 
proportionate costs. The dispositive portion of the decision states, in addition 
to the foregoing, that "the penalties herein imposed are subject to the 
provision of Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code in case of commutation of 
penalties", and that the accused shall be credited with one-half of their 
respective preventive imprisonment. </p>
<p>The indictment, under date of 19 January 1960, to which these three accused 
pleaded guilty, charges them as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 2nd day of June, J950, at 7:30 o'clock in the evening, 
more or less, in the barrio of Villa-pagasa, municipality of Bongabon, province 
of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused. Felix Magpantay, Arnulfo Estabaya, Eugenio 
A1cazar and Catalino Fajardo, all provided with unlicensed carbine rifle caliber 
.30 conspiring and confederating together, mutually helping one another and 
acting in common accord, with treachery and evident premeditation and the 
decided purpose to kill, taking advantage of the darkness of the night and their 
superior strength, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously way laid, ambushed, 
attacked, assaulted and shot Lope Cadacio, Emillio Claveria, Doroteo Malabanan, 
Albino Sarian, Rosendo Raes, Ignacio Francisco, Hermogena Atilano, Catalino 
Gervacio, Filomeno Macalalad and Alejandro Fernandez with their said carbine 
rifles, while the victims were riding in a passenger-jeep bearing Plate No. 
TPU-14016, and inflicting upon them several gunshot wounds in the different 
parts of their bodies which caused their instantaneous death. </p>
<p>"That in the commission of the crime, the qualifying circumstance of 
treachery and the generic aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, 
and taking advantage of their superior strength, are present. </p>
<p>"Contrary to law." </p></blockquote>
<p>The fourth accused Catalino Fajardo having pleaded not guilty, the decision 
under review was rendered with respect only to those named heretofore. The 
judgment considered two aggravating circum- stances, those of evident 
premeditation and superior strength, as present in the commission of the crime; 
Arnulfo Estabaya was, however, credited with the mitigating circumstances, those 
of plea of guilty and voluntary surrender, while Magpantay and Alcaraz were 
credited with one mitigating circumstance, that of having pleaded guilty. </p>
<p>In addition to their plea of guilty, each of the three accused, Magpantay, 
Alcnraz and Estabaya, insists on the mitigating circumstance of voluntary 
surrender. Magpantay claims, in addition thereto, lack of instruction. Estabaya 
adduced no evidence when the fiscal admitted that his surrender was voluntary. 
</p>
<p>In support of their claim for additional mitigation, Magpantay and Alcaraz 
declared that, after committing the crime, at about 7:U0 in the evening of 2 
June 1959 they went for the purpose of surrendering, to a certain Labo, a former 
barrio lieutenant of Villapagasa. They met him at about ten o'clock that same 
night. Labo refused to accept their surrender because he was no longer the 
incumbent official of the barrio; whereupon, Mappantay requested him to send 
word to the municipal mayor, Angel Rodriguez. </p>
<p>The accused then proceeded to barrio Rosacara, but the barrio lieutenant 
there also refused to accept their surrender on the ground that the crime was 
committed outside his territory. Magpantay requested him to fetch the mayor. The 
trio then proceeded to barrio Sapang Dagat, and from there Catalino Fajardo this 
co-accused had been with Magpantay and Alcaraz) prepared a letter to PC Sgt. 
Araman. </p>
<p>From Villapagasa to the <i>poblacion</i> of Bongabon is a distance of about 
13 kilometers; Rosacara is farther by some kilometers. The route taken by the 
accused from the scene of the crime was away from the <i>poblacion</i> and 
towards the mountains. . On the second day of the incident, the accused had been 
informed that PC soldiers had been issued orders to kill them at sight. </p>
<p>Mayor Rodriguez of Bongnbon was informed of Magpantay's desire to surrender 
to him at about seven o'clock in the morning of 10 June 1959. He reported the 
matter to the PC detachment in Bumagui and to Colonel Ver. That same morning 
Magpantay, in tears and without a firearm, surrendered to the mayor in a sitio 
of Villapagasa, about two kilometers inland from Liberty Sawmill. Thereafter, 
the mayor delivered custody of Magpantay to Colonel Ver at the sawmill where he 
had waited, as pre-arranged with the mayor. </p>
<p>Sgt. Araman, P.C., received Fajardo's note of surrender on the 11th of June, 
referred it to the provincial commander, contacted Fajardo and Alcaraz on the 
12th, slept with, them that same night, and on the following morning, on their 
way to the <i>poblacion</i>, the sergeant delivered the accused to his 
superiors. The accused then handed over their carbines. </p>
<p>Testifying in rebuttal for the prosecution, Sgt. Exequiel, Martinez asserted 
that civilians had informed the PC, of the whereabouts of the accused and that 
the area was cordoned with 160 soldiers. Said witness opined that this 
contingent provided no means of escape to the accused. When and how the area was 
cordoned was not touched upon, nor did he explain how escape had become 
impossible. Nor was it established that the accused knew' of their Aliened 
encirclement and that it prompted them to surrender in earnest. </p>
<p>We agree with herein appellants Alcaraz and Magpantay that the court below 
should have appreciated in their favor the mitigating circumstance of voluntary 
surrender Not only was there failure to prove that they felt that they had no 
other alternative course; but the fact that the PC authorities had waited at a 
designated place for the mayor to bring Magpantay down shows that they 
con-informed to his offer of voluntary surrender PC Colonel. Vcr waited at the 
sawmill to receive the surrender and not to capture him. The same thing can be 
said of appellant, Alcaraz, because the PC had prior knowledge of his offer to 
surrender when, on receipt of Fajardo's letter, Sgt. Araman referred it to the 
provincial commander; nor can it be contented that the P.C. officers and men 
effected a capture when they met Sgt. Araman and accused Alcaraz and Fajardo, 
already peacefully on their Way to the <i>poblacion</i>. </p>
<p>The flight of the accused from the scene of their crime to the mountains 
cannot be taken as belying their <i>bona fide</i> intention to surrender, 
because the evidence is unrebuted that they did earlier take steps to surrender. 
After "ommitting the crime, they defied no law or agent of authority, and when 
they did surrender, they did so with neekness and repentance. </p>
<p>Appellant Alcaraz, undisarmed, slept with Sgt. Araman in an isolated place; 
had ho been wanting in sincerity, Alcaraz, together with Fajardo, could easily 
have overpowered the sergeant, hut did not do so. On the following morning, when 
the trio met the constabulary men on the way to the <i>poblacion</i>, Alcaraz 
surrendered himself and his rifle without any trouble. </p>
<p>We find no particular reason, however, to disturb the trial court's rejection 
of Magpantay's alleged lack of instruction as a mitigating circumstance. His 
answer to the questions propounded to him show that he understood the 
significance of his acts, notwithstanding his illiteracy (People vs. Ripas, et 
al., 95 Phil. 63; People vs. Sari, L-7169, May 30, 1956). </p>
<p>The narration of the commission of the crime in the information avers five 
(5) circumstances which may qualify or aggravate the crime, namely: treachery, 
evident premeditation, superior strength, noclurnity, and band. However, in the 
succeeding paragraph, it specifies only the qualifying circumstance of treachery 
and the generic aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and superior 
strength, without alleging anew the other circumstances. In view thereof, the 
Solicitor-General believes that only evident premeditation and abuse of superior 
strength should be taken into account in deter- mining the penalty to be 
imposed, "since the view more favorable to the accused is that they had in mind" 
these two aggravating circumstances, which were reiterated by the fiscal in the 
paragraph following the narration of the commission of the crime "presumably for 
emphasis or clarification". To this view we agree. This separate specification 
certainly could have misled the accused and diverted their attention from the 
other aggravating circumstances included in the detailing of the crime. Under 
the circumstances, appellants in all probability pleaded guilty upon the 
estimation that the two aggravating circumstances stressed in the last portion 
of the iiifonruitio" could be, and were, neutralized by their voluntary 
surrender and plea of guilty. The doubt should be resolved in favor of the 
accused, considering that they were in no way to blame for the ambiguous terms 
in which the information is couched. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed judgment is affirmed, in so far as it finds the 
accused truilly of ten (10) separate murders, and modified by declaring that the 
aggravating circumstances of premeditation and superior strength were balanced 
by the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and plea of guilty. 
Consequently, the penalty should be that of the imprisonment (<i>reclusion 
perpetua</i>) for each offense, to be successively served up to the maximum 
limit of forty (40) years imprisonment provided by Article 70 of the Revised 
Penal Code. </p>
<p>The solidary civil indemnity of P6,000.00 for each one of the ten persona 
slaughtered, payable to the respective heirs, is also affirmed. Each appellant 
shall pay one fourth of the costs. </p>
