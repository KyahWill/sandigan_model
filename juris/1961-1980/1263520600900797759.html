				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> Transportation, Inc. seeks the
review of an award made by a referee of the Workmen's Compensation Commission,
as affirmed by a member of said Commission, and, later, by the Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While crossing a street, in <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, in the performance
of his duties as inspector-checker of the <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>
Transportation, Inc. - to inspect a bus thereof - Pastor <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span>
was, on <st1:date year="1954" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1954</st1:date>,
"bumped" by another <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, his right leg was fractured
and he became incapacitated to work, until June, 1954, when he resumed his work
in the company, but, this time, as an office checker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He held this job until <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1962</st1:date>, when he was separated from the
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1966</st1:date>, he filed, with the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, a claim for compensation, based upon said injury
sustained in 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>
filed, on <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1966</st1:date>,
its "Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness" stating, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that it would controvert the claim,
since the "cause of action has already expired, it being more than 10
yrs."</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 21, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span> filed an
amended claim, alleg­ing therein that he had "felt the weakening of his
bodily constitution and mental faculties due to a previous accident or injury
he suffered in line of duty as an inspector" of <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>
(referring to the accident of January 22, 1954), and that, in fact, he was
"separated from the service of the respondent company by reason of"
his aforementioned "injury or sickness incurred in line of duty." No
notice of <span class="SpellE">contro­version</span> thereof having been filed by
<span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span> moved
that his amended claim be declared <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>,
and Acting Referee Napoleon H. <span class="SpellE">Niñofranco</span>, of the
Workmen's Compensation Commis­sion, so declared in an order dated August 5,
1966, which, also, set the case for the reception of claimant's evidence on
August 23, 1966, and authorized <span class="SpellE">Alatco's</span> counsel to
"cross-examine the wit­nesses for the claimant, should he (counsel) so
desire."</p>

<p class="BODY">Over six (6) months later, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1967</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> filed
a motion for reconsideration of said order of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1966</st1:date>, and "reinstatement of its right to
controvert the claim of <span class="SpellE">Catim­bang</span>." On <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1967</st1:date>, said Acting Referee
issued an order modifying that of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August
 5, 1966</st1:date>, by granting <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> five (5) days
from notice to register its <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
filed on March 29, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> alleged prescription
of action; that the illness of <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span> was
contracted after his separation from the service and, hence, "not
work-connected"; that <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span> was "hale
and hearty" at the time of his separation from the service; and that it
was only upon the filing of the amended claim that <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>
came to know about his alleged illness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pastor <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span> having, meanwhile,
died on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1967</st1:date>, his
widow and children substituted him as claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1967</st1:date>, they filed a motion to set aside the
order of March 9, reinstating <span class="SpellE">Alatco's</span> right of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite <span class="SpellE">Alatco's</span> opposition thereto, the
Acting Referee granted the motion, in an order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Presently, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1967</st1:date>,
said officer issued an award, in favor of the claim­ants, directing <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> to pay the following:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the claimants, thru this Office, the sum of
FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO PESOS (P4,772.00) as compen­sation and
reimbursement of medical expenses, less any amount already paid to the claimant
as compensation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this Office, the amount of FORTY ONE PESOS
(P41.00) as fee pursuant to Section 55 of the Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To Atty. <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span>, counsel for the claimant, the amount of P200.00
as attorney's fee, pursuant to Sec. 31 of the Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On motion for reconsideration filed by <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>,
said award was, on <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1969</st1:date>,
affirmed by Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Paciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Villavieja</span>, in a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises duly considered, the Award sought to be
reconsidered is, as it is hereby, AFFIRMED and the respondent is or­dered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to claimants, through this Commission,
in lump sum, the total amount of FOUR THOUSAND (P4,000.00) PESOS, as
compensation benefits due to the claimants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to claimants, also through this
Commission, as reimbursement for medical expenses incurred, the total amount of
SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-TWO (P772.00) PESOS, pursuant to Section 13 of the Act;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to claimants' counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span>, the total
amount of FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN and 20/100 (P477.20) PESOS, as attorneys
fees, pursuant to Section 31 of the Act; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to the Workmen's Compen­sation Fund,
the total amount of FIFTY-THREE (P53.00) PESOS, as costs, which includes the
costs of this review, in accordance with Section 55 of the same Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of this decision having been unanimously denied
by the Workmen's Compensation Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> interposed the present appeal, in which it maintains
that said Com­mission had erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
"in awarding compensation to claimants-respondents on the ground that
petitioner failed to seasonably controvert the amended claim"; (2)
"in not dismissing the case on the ground of prescription"; (3)
"in awarding P772.00 as medical expenses to claimants-respondents";
and (4) "in awarding attorney's fees to claimants-respondents."</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of its first assignment of error, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>
argues that it could not possibly controvert the amended claim of <span class="SpellE">Catim­bang</span> until the same had been admitted; that said
amended claim was admitted by the order of August 5, 1966, which was received
by <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> on August 11, 1966; that it could not file
notice of <span class="SpellE">con­troversion</span> thereafter, because the
amended claim was already declared <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> in
said order; that, when, on motion of <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span>, its
right to controvert was reinstated by the order of March 9, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> filed its notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
within the period given in said order; and that the amended claim is based upon
the same injury sustained by <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span> in 1954.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alatco's</span> pretense is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even though the order of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1966</st1:date>, declared that the amended claim
was <span class="SpellE">uncon­troverted</span>, nothing prevented <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> from filing its notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
- if it really wanted to do so - within the statutory period computed from <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1966</st1:date>, when it received
notice of said order of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> did not
do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, it did nothing,
until six (6) months later, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="2">Febru­ary
 13, 1967</st1:date>, when it filed a motion for reconsideration of said order
of <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1966</st1:date>, and
reinstatement of its right to contro­vert the amended claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such motion necessarily implied an admission
of the fact that it had not as yet <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the
amended claim and that it no longer had the right to controvert the same,
unless it was reinstated in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that said right was reinstated by an order of <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1967</st1:date>, but this order was set
aside and revoked by ano­ther order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records do not show, and petitioner does not maintain, that said order of <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1967</st1:date>, was erroneous or had
been issued without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consequence thereof, the parties reverted
to their status prior to the issuance of the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the amended claim is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, even the original claim should be deemed <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> not having
filed a notice of <span class="SpellE">con­troversion</span> "before the
fourteenth day of disability or within ten days after" it had
"knowledge of the alleged accident" in 1954.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The record shows that <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> had knowledge of said
accident on the very date it happened, <st1:date year="1954" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of <span class="SpellE">con­troversion</span> included in the "Employer's Report of
Accident or Sickness" it filed twelve (12) years later, or on April 11,
1966, came, therefore, too late.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> invokes prescription under its
second assignment of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
noted, however, that the amended claim is based upon the illness that resulted
in <span class="SpellE">Catimbang's</span> separation from the service on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the prescriptive period of ten (10)
years began to run from such date, not from 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, since the amended claim is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> can not
avail of the defense of prescription of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third assignment of error is predicated upon the alleged
absence of competent evidence in support of the award of P772.00 for medical
expenses incurred by <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation is belied by the receipts
attached to page 17 of the Record of the Work­men's Compensation Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last assignment of error is based upon the theory that <span class="SpellE">Catimbang</span> is not entitled to compensation, which is false.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> is, however,
right in contending that the sum awarded as reim­bursement for medical expenses
may not be included in the com­putation of the attorney's fees,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
which should, accordingly, be reduced to P400.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this modification, the appealed decision of Associate
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Paciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Villavieja</span>
is hereby affirmed, there­fore, in all other respects, with costs against <span class="SpellE">Alatco</span> Transportation, Inc.</p>
