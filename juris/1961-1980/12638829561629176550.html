<p class="BODY">It was alleged in the amended complaint in Civil Case No. V-264
that:</p>

<blockquote>"3-a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon the death of Catalina <span class="SpellE">Mayorga</span> in the year stated in paragraph 2-a of this amended
complaint, the defendant, taking advantage of the minority of the plaintiffs
who were then all minors, commenced usurp­ing the southern portion of the
plaintiff's land described in paragraph 2 hereof, and unlawfully took
possession of the said portion which is more particularly described as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The southern portion bounded on the N. by part of the same land,
on the E. by part also of the same land, on the S. by <span class="SpellE">Macatok</span>
River, and on the W. by Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Albotra</span>; xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> containing an area of about 7 hectares';</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span> has been dis­turbing the plaintiffs' property
rights of dominion, enjoyment and possession of the land described in para­graph
2 hereof by wrongfully usurping its southern por­tion described in the
immediately preceding paragraph, and despite repeated demands and vigorous
objections and protests from the plaintiffs this defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span> has exercised and continues to exercise acts
over the aforesaid southern portion in derogation of the plaintiffs' title and
ownership, to the damage of the latter who have been unjustly deprived of the
harvest from the said portion; the amount of the said harvest and/or its value
shall be proved in the trial of this case as the said amount and/or value can
not now be determined for the rea­son that the defendant still continues to
reap the harvest from the aforesaid southern portion usurped by him." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 58, Record on Appeal, pp. 14-15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
his answer to the original complaint the defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span> interposed the following specific defenses:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That sometime prior to his death in 1935,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> sold, conveyed, and transferred to
defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span>
for P280.00 in Philippine currency the land in question between him and the
plaintiffs with the understanding that the correspond­ing deed of sale will be
executed by him at a later date, but unfortunately the same could not be done
due to the fact that he became sick from which sickness he did not recover;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That since 1935 and for about 15 years now,
defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span>,
with the knowledge of the plaintiffs, has been in possession of the land in
question between them as owner, in a manner open, public continuous, under a
claim of title adverse to all other claimants and exclusive of any other's
rights, having spent in its clearing, cultivation, and improve­ment about P5,000.00,
and for that matter alone the land in question now belongs to defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayo­tin</span> by acquisitive
prescription;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in December, 1946, plaintiffs as pre­sumptive
heirs of the late Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> executed a
document wherein they recognized thee sale of the land in question made by
their father to defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1949" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1949</st1:date>, plaintiffs filed Civil Case No. V-226 of
this Court for the recovery of the same land, entitled 'Marta <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, and

their counsels, filed their answers, and appeared several times before the
Court ready for trial, plaintiffs failed to appear and prosecute, with
consequence that this Hon. Court issued an order on February 7, 1950,
dismissing the said case with costs, thereby causing defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span> damages in the
amount of P500.00 which he paid his counsel as partial payment of the agreed
professional fee of P1,000.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the present action is frivolous and was
filed for the second time at the instance of cer­tain parties interested in the
land in question now that it is already cleared and converted into rice paddies
by defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span>,
thus said defendant is again compelled to secure the professional services of
undersigned counsel for P1,000.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(f)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That whatever <span class="GramE">right</span>
of action the plaintiffs may have had in relation to the land in question said
right of action is now barred by the Statute of Limi­tation as well as by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 58,

deed of sale was executed and that on December 7, 1946, Marta <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and
one <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
exe­cuted a private document entitled 'Deed of Absolute Sale' confirming the
sale of the said portion of land in question made by their father and that the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span>
has been in possession of the land in question since 1932 up to the time <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span> was testifying on
October 27, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The homestead patent
No. 16835 issued in the name of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> was
issued on <st1:date year="1931" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1931</st1:date>
and certificate of title No. 1313 was issued on <st1:date year="1931" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1931</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On that year 1931, the law enforced was already Act No. 2874 and that
law prohibits the alienation, disposal or en­cumbering of such land within five
years from the date of issuance of the patent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sale made by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> on a portion
of the land covered by patent No. 16835 and certificate of title No. 1313 was
null and void because it is contrary to the provisions of Act No. 2874, and
contrary to an announced public policy of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 1 for the defendant, which is
entitled 'Deed of Absolute <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>,'
cannot validate the illegal and invalid sale made by the registered owner,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, while Exhibit 1 is entitled 'Deed of Absolute
Sale,' yet the substance of said document is only to confirm the sale of the
said portion of land in question by said Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in the answer filed by
the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, is stated as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">'(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That sometime prior to his death in 1935,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> sold, con­veyed, and transferred to
defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span>
for P280.00 in Philippine currency the land in question between him and the
plain­tiffs; that in December, 1946, plaintiffs as presumptive heirs of the
late Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tino</span> executed a document wherein
they re­cognized the sale of the land in question made by their father to
defendant <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span>.'</p>

<blockquote>"In other words, the validity of Exhibit 1, which is just a
confirmation of sale, or in the words of the defendant, <span class="GramE">a
recognition</span> of the sale of the land in question, depends upon the
validity of the sale made by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale made by Felipe <span class="SpellE">To­lentino</span>
being null and void, consequently, the con­firmation does not change the nature
of the sale or the invalidity, for an absolutely void act cannot be
subsequently validated by the heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be noted that in Exhibit 1, one of the heirs by the name of <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> did not sign for he was still a minor." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 38-40, Decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. No. 29611-R, pp. 9-11)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant, <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gayotin</span> now petitioner, contends that the decision of the
Court of Appeals is erroneous on the fol­lowing grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to assign as error the trial court's
conclusion that <span class="SpellE">laches</span> is a valid defense to the
action operated as a waiver thereof, such that the Court of Appeals should not
have considered, much less passed judgment on, said 'question'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the case of J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Macalindong</span>,
the ruling in Mejia de Lucas v. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span> was never
abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the contrary, it was
adhered to and reiterated with consistency in several decisions of the
Honorable Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner-vendee is entitled to reimburse­ment
of the price he paid for the land and the value of the improvements he had
introduced thereon<span class="GramE">. "</span> (Petition, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 14)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the undisputed facts of record recited above, the
decision of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error that respondents failed to assail
in their appeal the trial court's conclusion that their action was barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and the Court of Appeals should not have overruled
the trial court's erroneous conclusion is mere sophistry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As may be readily seen from respondents'
assignment of error in their brief in the Court of Appeals, they expressly
asserted that "the lower court erred in applying the doctrine of '<span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>'….<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was erroneous for the lower court to rely
on said doctrine for the reason that all the indispensable elements of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by lathes are not present in the instant
case."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals therefore correctly cited the established
doctrine in favor of respondents, <u><span style="">mutatis</span></u><span style=""> <u>mutandis</u>, </span>that "because
the subject of the transaction is a piece of public land, public policy
requires that [plaintiffs], as heir(s), be not prevented from reacquiring it
because it was given by law to [their] family for [their] home and
cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the policy on which
our homestead law is predi­cated (<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Talens</span>, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This right cannot be waived. 'It is not within the competence of any
citizen to barter away what public policy by law seeks to preserve.' <span class="GramE">(Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Sons, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> de <span class="SpellE">las</span> <span class="SpellE">Ama</span>, et al., 74 Phil. 3)."</span> (Land Registration
&amp; Mortgages by Francisco, pp. 586-587, third edition)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals
likewise correctly rejected petitioner's defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>,
since "the defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> is an equitable one
concerned only with whether or not by reason of the plaintiff's long inaction
or inexcusable neglect, he should be barred from asserting (his) claim at all,
because to allow him to do so would be inequitable and unjust to
defendant." (<span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>,
Jr., 37 SCRA 518) The facts show no such "long inaction or inexcusable
neglect" on res­pondents' part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is manifest that they were still minors at the time of the void sale in 1932
and that when they executed in December, 1946 the document recognizing the sale
made by their father who died in 1935, one of them was still a minor and could
not sign the document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within two and a
half years later, in July 1949 (and later in March 1950) they promptly
repudiated the document and filed suit for recovery of the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to petitioner's second
assignment of error, the ruling of Lucas vs. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>,
100 Phil. 277, on <span class="SpellE">laches</span> where the patentee's right
to recover possession of the property was converted into an unenforceable stale
demand by patentee's long inaction and neglect for </span>37 years
notwithstanding that defendant's possession for the said period could not
destroy the patentee's indefeasible title finds no application in the instant
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the third assignment of error, we find that petitioner is
entitled only to reimbursement of the price of P280.00 but not of the value of
the improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Payment of such price
of P280.00 should be made by respondents to petitioner within 90 days and
should they fail to do so, petitioner may apply for a writ of execution against
them to satisfy the said sum of P280.00, following the procedure in <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Porciongcola</span>, 69
Phil. 305.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner is entitled to no more, much less the value of the improvements,
because as was held in <u>Angeles vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 102 Phil. 1006,
"the heirs of the homestead should be declared to have lost and forfeited
the value <span class="GramE">of</span> the products gathered from the land and
so should the defendants lose the value of the necessary improvements that they
have made thereon." Petitioner has enjoyed the fruits and products of the
land for 27 years - since the filing of the suit below (which should by right
have pertained to res­pondents) and he cannot be heard to complain of any
inequity or injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby
affirmed, with the modification that respondents shall pay petitioner the sum
of P280.00 by way of reimbursement of the price of the void sale, as stated in
the preceding paragraph.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the long <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
case since respondents' filing thereof in 1950, during which time they have
been wrongfully deprived of the possession and enjoyment of the property, this
judgment is de­clared immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon its
promulgation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is ordered to
forthwith surrender the land and its improvements to res­pondents upon notice
hereof and upon his failure to do <span class="GramE">so,</span> respondents may
apply to the court <u>a quo</u> for a writ of execution and immediate pos­session
upon the strength of this decision and without awaiting the re­mand of the
records.</p>
