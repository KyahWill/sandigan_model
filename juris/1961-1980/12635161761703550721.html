<p class="BODY"><span style="">The factual background of
this petition is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
hearing of Cadastral Case No. 12 (LRC Cad. </span><span style="">Rec. No. 377) of the </span><span style="">Court
</span><span style="">of </span><span style="">First Instance </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> on June 12, 1956, only respondent
Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> appeared, and </span><span style="">so </span><span style="">the court entered an order of general default, and said respondent was
allowed to present evidence support of her claim of possession and ownership
over two parcels of lands known </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">Lots Nos. </span>9102 and 9103.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, <st1:date year="1956" day="13" month="6">June
 13, 1956</st1:date>, Tomas Manuel, grandfather of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Manuel Castillo <span class="SpellE">Udan</span>, who
was then a minor, filed in behalf of said petitioner an answer (opposition)
claiming ownership and possession of the two lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, said Tomas Manuel, again in
behalf of petitioner, filed a motion to set aside the hearing and/or order of
default alleging that respondent <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
misrepresented that the two lots were in her possession although she fully knew
that the lots were in the possession of petitioner and had been in the posses­sion
of her predecessor-in-interest since 1936, publicly, continuously, and
peacefully; and that respondent was fully aware that those lots were sold by
Maria <span class="SpellE">Fontillas</span> to <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aglibot</span>, who in turn sold them to petitioner's
mother, because in the morning of June 12, 1956, the day of the hearing,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was with Tomas Manuel in the
office of petitioner's counsel and was shown the deed of sale of said lots in
favor of petitioner's mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on
the motion of Tomas Manuel, the trial court issued an order, <span style="">d</span>a<span style="">ted </span><st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1956</st1:date>,
lifting the order of default and admitting the answer of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, respondent <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> filed
motions to set the case for hearing, but the record does not show that the case
was ever heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1956</st1:date>, said respondent filed a
motion to dismiss the opposition or answer of petitioner, which motion was
granted by the trial court in its order of<span style="">
</span><st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1957</st1:date>,
and thereupon the two lots were adjudicated to respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­tending that the lower court<span style=""> </span>erred in entering the aforementioned
order adjudicating the lots in<span style=""> </span>question
to respondent <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> without giving petitioner an
opportunity to be heard or present her evidence, petitioner brought an appeal
to this Court, which was docketed as <span style="">G. </span>R.
No. L-18372.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1962</st1:date>, this Court rendered a
decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"On the whole, we believe that the interests of justice will <span style="">be </span><span class="SpellE">subserved</span>
if this case is remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for further
proceedings, giving appellant Castillo the opportunity to present her evidence
of alleged ownership of the lots in question."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, the district Judge, pursuant to Section 88 of
Republic Act 296, issued Administrative Order No. 1 designating respondent
Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Amon</span>
of San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
to try the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, respondent
Judge set the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="8">August
 27, 1964</st1:date>, and notice of said hearing was received by petitioner's
counsel on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the day of the scheduled hearing, petitioner personally
submitted to respondent Judge her counsel's motion (dated August 26, 1954) to
postpone the hearing to the following day, based on the ground that he had to
appear before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> in the hearing of Civil Case No. 1684 and
Cad. Case <span style="">No. </span>14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was forthwith denied by
respondent Judge in his order issued on the same day, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court noted that there is a motion for postponement
attached to the record of the case, which motion was only received today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact was made known to Atty.
Evangelista, counsel for claimant Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>,
and he manifested likewise that he only received a copy of the said motion at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 a.m.</st1:time>, today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Evangelista argued against the said
motion for postponement contending, among others, that the said motion is not
in conformity with the provisions of Rule 26, Rules of Court, in that the
required three days notice was not complied with; that counsel for <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dolojan</span>) should
not have presumed that his motion will be granted; and, that it said counsel,
Atty. Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Dolojan</span>, wanted to postpone this case,
he should have taken steps toward this end since it appears that he received
notice since August 12, 1964, in order to spare the claimants unnecessary delay
and expenses in coming all the way from Manila to this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that this case has been pending for already a
long time, and finding that the vigorous opposition of counsel for claimant
Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> to be well taken and meritorious
and for an overriding <span style="">consideration
that any lawyer has no reason to assume that this Court would grant his motion
for postponement (<span class="SpellE">Montelibano</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Benares</span>, G. R. No. L-10824) the Court is constrained to
deny the motion for postponement.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the previous order of this court
adjudicating the property in question in favor of the claimant <span style="">Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
stands undisturbed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="9">September 1, <span style="">1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>petitioner filed her motion for
reconsideration, but the same was denied for lack merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1964</st1:date>, petitioner filed her second motion for reconsideration,
and this was again denied respondent Judge in his order of <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1964</st1:date> for being <u><span style="">pro</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>forma</u> and for non-compliance with the rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her third motion for reconsideration was
<span style="">also</span> denied by respondent Judge,
petitioner filed, on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1965</st1:date>,
the instant petition for certiorari before <span style="">this </span>Court, imputing abuse of discretion on the part o<span style="">f</span> res­pondent Judge in denying her
motion for postponement and her subsequent motions for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue before this Court now is whether, or not, respondent
Judge had abused his discretion in issuing his<span style=""> </span>order of August 27, 1964 denying petitioner's motion <span style="">for postponement of the hearing and forthwith
reviving the previous order of the court adjudicating </span><span style="">the prop</span><span style="">erty in question in favor of respondent Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Casteñeda</span>,
and in denying later the subsequent motions for reconsideration that were filed
by petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Motions for <span style="">postponement
are addressed to the sound </span>discretion of the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That discretion must be exercised wisely,
considering the peculiar circumstances obtaining in each <span style="">case </span>and with a view to doing substantial
justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, it is not denied that on the day of the hearing petitioner
herself sub<span style="">mitted to the court her
counsel's motion for </span><span style="">postponement
of the hearing because the counsel had to attend to o</span><span style="">ther trials in </span><span style="">the Court of First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zambales</span></span><span style=""> on the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that counsel for peti</span><span style="">tioner requested that the hearing be
postponed even </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the following day shows that his purpose was
not to delay the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
shows that that was the </span><span style="">first
time that the case </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">set </span><span style="">for hearing after it was remanded from the Supreme Court, and that was
also the </span><span style="">first </span><span style="">time that petitioner asked for
postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the </span><span style="">case was remanded </span><span style="">by the Supreme Court precisely for the
purpose of giving the petitioner the opportunity to present her evidence, We
believe that respondent Judge should have granted the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, et al. v. Duran, L-19885, July 31, 1965, one of
the plaintiffs therein, at the scheduled </span><span style="">heari</span><span style="">ng</span><span style=""> on </span><span style="">June 28, 1961, delivered to the court personally</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
telegram of their counsel asking for postponement of the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court denied the motion and upon appeal
this Court </span><span style="">set aside </span><span style="">the order of denial, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There seems to be no question that mo<span style="">tions for continuance are addressed </span><span style="">to the sound discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it has been repeatedly held that the said discretion must be
exercised wisely (Capital <span class="SpellE">Subdiv</span>. v. <span class="SpellE">Prov</span>. of Neg. <span class="SpellE">Occ</span>., L-6204, July
31, 1956).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident from the
records, that appellants were not neglectful of their duties and obligations
towards the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the plaintiffs
(<span class="SpellE">Eufrasia</span> <span class="SpellE">Capiao</span>) was
present during the hearing of June 28, 1961, </span><span style="">and she was </span>the <span style="">one </span><span style="">who presented the </span>tele<span style="">gram of their counsel to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A delay </span><span style="">in the </span><span style="">adjudication of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">case occasioned by </span>a <span style="">reasonably
justified continuance of the hearing </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">afford </span>a <span style="">party (here the plaintiffs) the opportunity
to present his evidence would not materially prejudice the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, one more postponement in the
instant case, would be in consonance with fair play and justice (<span class="SpellE">Ty</span> </span><span style="">v. <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Seguros</span>,
et al., L-15928-33, Sept. 3, 1960).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
case </span><span style="">of recent vintage, </span><span style="">We have made </span><span style="">the following pronouncements:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Viewed from the strictly legal perspective, it appears <span style="">that the pe­tition was presented outside the <span class="SpellE">re<span style="">glementary</span></span></span><span style=""> period of sixty (60) days from notice of the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, due to the very
peculiar </span><span style="">cir</span><span style="">cumstances obtaining in the premises, We consider
that the rule </span>was <span style="">substantially
complied with and the petition for relief from judgment was seasonably
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rules should receive liberal
interpretation in order to promote their </span><span style="">object and to assist the parties </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">obtaining a just, </span><span style="">speedy and inexpensive determination of every
</span><span style="">action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Procedural technicality, should not be made </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">bar
</span><span style="">td </span><span style="">the vindication of a legitimate
grievance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When such technicality
"deserts from being an aid to justice", the Courts are justified in
excepting from its operation</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> x.' </span><span style="">(PHHC
v. <span class="SpellE">Tiongco</span>, et al., L-18891, Nov. 28, 1964.)"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">case of Aurora <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Zubiri</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Zub<span style="">iri</span></span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">et al., L-16745, December 17, 1966, this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Although the allowance or denial of petitions for postponement
and the setting aside of previous duly issued orders rest principally upon the
sound discretion of <span style="">the </span>magistrate
to whom they are addressed (Tell v. Tell, 48 Phil. 70; <span class="SpellE">Macke</span>
v. Campo, 5 Phil. 185; Salve v. <span class="SpellE">Palacio</span>, et al., <span style="">G. R. </span>No. L-4247, January 30, 1952),
the exercise of this power, however, ought to be prudent and just.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should always be predicated on the <span style="">consideration </span>that more than the
convenience of the courts or of the parties of the case, the ends of justice
and fairness would be <span style="">served thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In the case at bar, this,
consideration seems to <span style="">have been
incompletely observed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"In the first place,
the motion for </span>postponement under consideration was the very first filed
by the counsel <span style="">for the ap­pellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its </span>ground was not <span style="">unreasonable and hardly flimsy since </span>it
is not denied that then, the counsel for the appellant was <span style="">under some contractual commitments from which
he needed time to be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
these circumstances, it does seem that the denial of the motion prevented
rather than serve the ends of justice."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court has held that
in incidents of this </span><span style="">nature </span><span style="">before the trial court two circumstances
should be taken into consideration, namely, (1) the reasonableness of the
postponement and (2) the merits of the case if the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the filing of the motion for postponement in the instant
case may not be timely because it was done only on the day of the hearing, the
circumstance, however, was that counsel for petitioner had a trial commitment
in another court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">We </span>have adverted to, the motion for
postponement could not have been intended for delay as counsel for petitioner
asked that the hearing be postponed to the next day.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that on the day of the hearing, on August 27,
1964, the petitioner was in possession of the two lots in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Possession is<span style=""> </span>an attribute of
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in remanding this
case to the court below, as ordered in the decision in G. R. No. L-18372,
November 29, 1962, was precisely impressed by the merit of the claim of
ownership of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the considered view that under the circumstances
obtaining in this case in the court below respondent Judge gravely abused his
discretion when he issued the order of August 27, 1964 denying petitioner's
motion to postpone the hearing of this case to the day following the date set
for the hearing and reviving the previous order of the court adjudicating the
property in question to respondent Beatriz <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
without giving petitioner a chance to present evidence in support of her claim
of ownership over the said property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion when he denied
the three motions for reconsideration of the order of August 27, 1964 filed by
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At this juncture We
consider it meet to quote what this Court said in the case of <span class="SpellE">McEntee</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Manotok</span>, <u>supra</u>,
</span>as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At this stage of the proceedings we must remind judges and
counsel that the rules of procedure are not to be applied in a very rigid,
technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure substantial
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rule 1, Sec. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a technical and rigid enforcement of the
rules is made, their aim would be defeated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, it appears that the rules which are merely secondary
in importance are made to override the ends of justice; the technical rules had
been misapplied to the prejudice of the substantial right of a party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the writ of certiorari prayed for </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The orders of respondent
Judge in Cadastral Case No. 12, LRC Cad. Record No. 377 (Lots Nos. 9102 and
9103), of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
dated August 27, 1964, September 26, 1964, December 4, 1964, and February 3,
