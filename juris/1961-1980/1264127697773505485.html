<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Manila Collector of Customs, 
through the Solicitor General, has <span class="SpellE">recoursed</span> to this 
Court against the actuations of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch 
XXII, presided over by Judge Federico C. <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>, in 
Civil Case No. 51824, De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship Co., Inc., 
vs. Acting Collector of Customs, claiming that the orders and injunction issued 
in said case are void for lack of jurisdiction, and sought a writ of certiorari 
to review and set the same aside, as well as a writ of prohibition to stop the 
judge from hearing and deciding the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon petitioner's request, this 
Court issued a preliminary writ of injunction on </span><st1:date month="2" day="25" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 25, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record before us discloses 
the basic facts to be as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship, Co., Inc., a domestic corporation, operated 
and represented the S/S "</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mentor</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">", a foreign vessel, which was 
seized on </span><st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 28, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> by 
the Collector of Customs of Manila on charges of having conveyed <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> cargo and shipside discharge thereof without 
proper authorization. The vessel was subsequently released upon a P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> bond filed by the shipping 
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Two days later, the Collector 
imposed on the vessel an administrative fine of P30<span class="GramE">,000</span>, for violations of the Tariff and Customs Code, and 
demanded immediate payment from De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship, 
Co. The next day the company protested the fine in writing, and requested to be 
heard. Hearing was scheduled on </span><st1:date month="7" day="2" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 2, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, but 
was postponed for August 6 and 7, but counsel for De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> could not be present, allegedly because notice of the 
hearing was not served in time. Evidently, not satisfied with the explanation, 
the Collector reaffirmed the fine, and denied the company's requests for 
reconsideration. The shipping company, on September 13, filed notice of appeal 
to the Commissioner of Customs but was informed that the appeal "cannot be given 
due course in view of the ruling of the Commissioner of Customs that fines on 
vessels must be paid first and its payment may be protested if the interested 
party so desires". Thereupon, De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship, 
Co. initiated Case No. 51824 in the Court of First Instance of Manila, praying 
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, it is respectfully 
prayed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(a) That a Writ of Preliminary 
Injunction be issued ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> upon the filing by the 
petitioner of a bond executed to the respondent In an amount fixed by this Hon. 
Court, commanding and otherwise ordering the respondent, his agents, 
subordinates, or employees to refrain from enforcing against the petitioner the 
payment of the aforesaid fine in any manner whatsoever and/of to restrain or 
otherwise seize said vessel S/S "Mentor" or such other vessel of petitioner, 
pending final judgment in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">b) That, after hearing, a 
judgment be renderedâ€” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) Declaring illegal the 
imposition by respondent of the fine P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> upon 
petitioner and his denial of petitioner's right to appeal;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) Making permanent the Writ of 
Preliminary Injunction; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(3) Ordering respondent to grant 
petitioner the opportunity to be heard in reference to the alleged charges 
giving rise to the imposition of the fine.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner further prays for such 
remedies as may be just and proper in the 
premises."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court below having issued an 
injunction as prayed for by the Company, the Collector of Customs moved t0 
dismiss the case, on the ground that under Republic Ac No. 1125, and the Customs 
and Tariff Code (R. A. 1937), jurisdiction to review the imposition of the fine 
was vested in the Court of Tax Appeals. Dismissal having been denied, the 
Collector sought relief in this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue is squarely one of 
jurisdiction: did the Court of First Instance of Manila have jurisdiction to 
entertain the action filed by the respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship, Co.?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our answer must be in the 
negative. As shown by the allegations and prayer of the complaint filed below, 
the action of the steamship company sought to have the Court of First Instance 
review the decision and order of the Collector of Customs and enjoin their 
enforcement. Such a review violates the provisions of the Administrative Code 
(section 1380) and the law creating the Court of Tax Appeals, in so far as it 
seeks to deprive the Commissioner of Customs of his power to review the 
decisions of its subordinate, the Collector of Customs and to bar the Court of 
Tax Appeals from the exercise of its statutory exclusive appellate jurisdiction 
to review by appeal decisions of the Commissioner of Customs on fines or matters 
arising under the Customs Law, or any other law or part of law administered by 
the Bureau of Customs (Rep. Act No. 1125, sec. 7, par. (2). In the past, this 
Court has repeatedly brooked no interference by courts of first instance with 
decisions of the Customs authorities in such matters, even in the guise of 
petitions for mandamus or certiorari (<span class="SpellE">Millarez</span> 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>, 97 Phil. 282; <span class="SpellE">Namarco</span> 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, 98 Phil. 185), ruling that, in all matters covered 
by section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Republic Act No. 1125, sec. 7, 
effective 16, 1954, * * * necessarily has taken away the power of the Manila 
Court of First Instance to "review" decisions of the Customs authorities * *" 
(<span class="SpellE">cas</span>. cit.)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> vigorously argues that the Court of Tax Appeals can 
only review decisions of the Commissioner of Customs; that the decision here 
complained of was one by the Collector, not by the Commissioner, of Customs; and 
that the Collector has refused to give due course to and blocked the 
respondent's appeal to the Commissioner, leaving it without remedy. This excuse 
is untenable. Since the Commissioner of Customs can review decisions of the 
Collector (Adm. Code, sec. 1380), the latter's refusal to give due course to the 
appeal, if abusive, could be set aside by the Commissioner, in order that his 
supervisory power be not rendered nugatory. It nowhere appears that the 
Steamship Company ever complained to the Commissioner of Customs of his 
subordinate's action, or that the Commissioner has denied the company any remedy 
against the ruling complained of. Had the Commissioner sustained the Collector, 
the way would then be open for <span class="GramE">a recourse</span> to the Court 
of Tax Appeals. It is thus clear that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama's</span> 
court action below was barred by its failure to exhaust its administrative 
remedies. Instead it tried to sidetrack the regular course of appeal marked out 
by the Administrative law and Republic Act 1125, and <span class="SpellE">endeavoured</span> to make the Court of First Instance take 
cognizance of matters outside of its jurisdiction, adding to the present court 
congestion, with a totally unnecessary case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the writs of certiorari and 
prohibition applied for by the Collector of Customs are hereby granted, and the 
respondent Court of First Instance is directed to refrain from proceeding with 
its Case No. 51824; and the preliminary injunction therein issued by respondent 
court is annulled and set aside. <span class="GramE">Costs in both instances 
against private respondent De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship 
Company, Inc.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
