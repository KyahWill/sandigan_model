for the Purchase of lot 25, Flock 24, Fes-2551, of the aforesaid estate,
containing an area of 125.7 square meters. On <st1:date year="1951" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1951</st1:date>. Director of Lands Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Dans</span>, acting for and in representation of the Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
executed an "Agreement to Sell" (contract no. 06213) covering the
said lot in favor of the applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
agreement was approved by the Secretary Agriculture and Resources on the same.
The applicant then made a down payment of P128.27, and obligated herself to pay
the balance iii installments of P12.00 a month for 10 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 1, 1054 Lorenzo Cabrera protest the execution of the
"Agreement to Sell," on the ground that he has the preferential right
to buy the lot as an occupant thereof. In view of this protest, the Director of
Lands conducted an investigation at which the protestant and the applicant
adduced their respective testimonial and documentary evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1955</st1:date>
the Director rendered a decision, the per­tinent portions of which are quoted hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * Lorenzo Cabrera adduced testimo­nial and documentary
evidence which substantially tend to show that the lot in question was first oc­cupied
in 1940 by one Lucia Gabriel who constructed thereon a 'barong-barong' that on
February 8, 1947, as actual occupant, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Gabriel
made a deposit of forty (P40.00) pesos with the defunct Rural Progress
Administration for the acquisition of a portion of the <span class="SpellE">Nuestra</span>
<span class="SpellE">Señora</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> Estate
(Exhibit 'A', Cabrera); that on April 22, 1947, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
Gabriel sold his rights to the land and barong-barong standing thereon in favor
of his mother <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>,
(Exhibit Cabrera); that later on, <span class="SpellE">Seve­rina</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> transferred her rights to Cabrera; and that in 1948
he allowed <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>
to occupy the vacant portion of the lot in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>
and her witness alleged that the land in question formed part of the land which
her brother-in-law, Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Llorena</span> fenced; that in
1939 she occupied the land by fill­ing it up and building a barong-barong thereon;
that When the land was acquired by the Government, the area fenced by Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Llorena</span> was subdivided into two (2) lots, hence, <span class="SpellE">Llorena</span> gave the lot in question occupied by <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> to her; that
the barong-barong of Lorenzo Cabre­ra was constructed in 1948 in the adjacent
road lot; that this site occupied by Lorenzo Cabrera belongs formerly to one
Pedro Flores who sold his rights to Lorenzo Cabrera; that it is not true that
she was merely tolerated by the claimant to - occupy, the land; that she has
been paying her ren­tals for the occupation of the lot since February 24, 1947
(Exhibit 1 and I-A, <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>); and that she filed her
application to purchase the lot in ques­tion on June 5, 1950, and Agreement to
Sell No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>06213 was issued in her favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lorenzo Cabrera has contested the sale of the land in favor
of <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> on the
ground of prior occupancy of the lot by himself and his, predecessors in
interest, rut the evi­dence presented by him on this point has failed to
establish that the alleged lot occupied and sold by <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
Gabriel in favor of <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>,
the mother of Lorenzo Cabrera (Exhibit A) is the same lot in question. It is
true that presently his house on the road-lot protrudes on a portion of the lot
in controversy, but it is believed this was a recently built addition to this
house. This belief is supported by the sketch plan of the lots in the <span class="SpellE">Nuestra</span> <span class="SpellE">Señora</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> Estate, prepared in the later part of 1950, after a
census of the occupants of the estate was made and the relative Positions of
their occupations ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This plan
shows that Lot No. 26, Block 24, Pcs-2561 of the estate is solely occupied by <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>, while Lorenzo
Cabrera is occupying the road-lot adja­cent to the lot subject of this case. On
the basis of the foregoing and because of the fact that <span class="SpellE">Cre­sencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> has been paying her rentals for the land
since February, 1947, we are more inclined to give credence to he alleged prior
occupancy of the lot in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Office holds and so decides that the claim of
Lorenzo Cabrera should be, as hereby it is, denied and dismissed. The sale of
the Lot No, 26, Block 24, Pcs-2561, <span class="SpellE">Nuestra</span> Senora de
Gina Estate, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, to <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> shall be given due course."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Director, acting on Cabrera's subsequent petition for
reconsideration or reopening of the administrative case, rendered an amended
decision on <st1:date year="1955" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1955</st1:date>,
finding that Cabrera's house protrudes on a portion of the lot in question,
designated as "X", of an area of 7.8 square meters. The Director
resolved to exclude that portion from the area sold to <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> and awarded it to Cabrera.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The protestant and the applicant moved for a reconsideration of the amended
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Land Tenure Administration; which in the meantime had assumed
the functions and powers of the Landed Estates Divi­sion, resolved the motions
for reconsideration (LTC Case 100, en­titled "Lorenzo Cabrera vs. <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>") in an
order dated November 23, 1956, by modifying, the amended decision of the
Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered the
division of lot 26 into two separate lots of 68.7 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>.
and 57 sq. m. The first it awarded to <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>, the
second to Lorenzo Cabrera, en appeal by <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>,
Assistant Executive Secretary Enrique <span class="SpellE">Quema</span> of the
Office of the President affirmed the amended decision of the Director of Lands
in a letter of <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1959</st1:date>,
in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>" * * * neither of the parties acquired pre­ferential rights
to the lot in question as bona fide tenants of the estate. However, both were
recog­nized as occupants thereof, it appearing that they had erected their
respective dwellings thereon. The house of <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> is on the upper portion while that of Lorenzo
Cabrera occupies a part of the lower portion and of a road lot. Por­tion 'X',
which was originally awarded to Loren­zo Cabrera, contains only seven and 8/10
square meters. The utter impracticability of erecting a dwelling on such a
small area is too evident to require argument.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that the parties herein have equal rights to
occupancy and that the award of portion 'X' to Lorenzo Cabrera is inequitable',
the Land Tenure Administration subdivided the lot in such a manner as to be
responsive to the needs of both parties to erect their respective houses
thereon. In so doing, it acted not only in conformity with the law and
regulations on the matter but al­so in harmony with the established policy of
affording the landless equal opportunities to acquire home lots."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1959</st1:date>
the Land Tenure Administration executed an "Agreement to Sell"
(contract no. 4049) covering lot 26-A of lot 26, containing an area of 57
square meters, in favor of Lorenzo Cabrera.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 21, 1964 <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> instituted the present action in the Court of
First Instance of Manila, impugning the award and subsequent sale of the
57-square­meter portion of lot 26 to Lorenzo Cabrera as an "illegal and
unwarranted impairment of the obligation of contract," because long before
the award was made the Government had already sold the entire lot to her. She
prayed that the orders and decisions of the Land Tenure Administration and the
Assistant Executive Secretary be annulled and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the issues raised in the complaint and discussed in the
separate answers filed by the Land Tenure Administration and by Lorenzo
Cabrera, and in the memoranda of the contending parties, the lower court
rendered judgment on June 26, 1965, dismissing the complaint, without costs,
upon the view "that the order or decision sought to be reviewed and
annulled has [not] violated any rule or law, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> since the alleged contract (No. 06213) is governed by
rules and regulations on the matter and are subject to conditions which must
first be complied with. In short, said contract is not final and
absolute."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal by the spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue tendered for resolution is whether the lower court
erred in holding that no "rule or law" has been violated by the Land
Tenure Administration and the Assistant Executive Secretary in ad­judging that <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> and Lorenzo
Cabrera "have <u>equal rights</u> to occupancy" of lot 26, and are
entitled to 68. 7 and 57 square meters of the lot, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the decision of the Land Tenure Administration which was
affirmed by the Assistant Executive Secretary and echoed by the decision
appealed from, found that <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> actually occupied
117.9 of the 125.7-square-meter lot in dispute, and that Cabrera actually
occupied the remaining 7.8 square meters, it nevertheless, considered the
"utter impracticability of erecting a dwelling [by Lorenzo] on Such a
small area" of 7.8 square meters, and resolved to reduce the portion
occupied by <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> by 49.2 square meters and add it
to Lorenzo's, and awarded to him a total area of: 57 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the view that the Land Tenure Administration and the
Office of the President incurred in grave error in declar­ing that Cabrera is,
entitled to the portion of lot 26 awarded to him. And we hold that, upon the
evidence on record, <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> has satis­factorily
established her preferential right to purchase the entire lot to the exclusion
of Cabrera, for several reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>. - <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> occupied the
lot in 1939, and introduced improvements thereon by "filling it up"
and building a <u>barong-barong</u>. Cabrera, on his part, claims that his
predecessor <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Gabriel first occupied the lot in
1940. <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> was, therefore, ahead in date of
occupation by 1 year. <u>Second</u>. - The "sketch' plan" of the lots
comprising the <span class="SpellE">Nuestra</span> Senora de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>
Estate, prepared in the later part of 1950 after a census of the occupants of
the estate was made and their relative positions ascertained, shows that
"lot No. 26, Block 24, Pcs-2561 of the estate is solely occupied by <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>, while Lorenzo
Cabrera is occu­pying the road-lot adjacent to the lot subject .of this
case." <u>Third</u>. - Apart from <span class="SpellE">Antonel's</span>
prior occupancy of the lot in dispute, she has been paying rentals since <st1:date year="1947" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1947</st1:date>. Cabrera, on the
other hand, has not paid any rental for his; supposed occupation of the
7.8-square-meter portion of the disputed lot. His averment that <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Gabriel made a 40 deposit with the defunct Rural
Progress Administration does not improve his posi­tion, because the deposit was
made in general terms, that is, "for the acquisition of a portion of the <span class="SpellE">Nuestra</span> Senora de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>
Estate," and not specifically for lot 26, <u>Fourth</u>. - <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span> applied for the purchase of the entire lot as early
as June 5, 1950, and, on the basis of this application, the Director of Lands,
on April 6, 1951, executed "Agreement to Sell" no. 16213 in her
favor. This agreement was approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources on the same date. She made a first payment in the sum of P128. 27.
Upon the other hand, Cabrera has never applied for the purchase of the lot or
of the portion thereof sup­posedly occupied by him. <u>Fifth</u>. - Cabrera
protested the "Agreement to Sell" only after more than 4 years' and 4
months had elapsed from June 5, 1950 (when <span class="SpellE">Antonel</span>
filed her application to purchase the entire lot), and after 3 years and 6
months had passed since April 6, 1951 (When the Bureau of Lands executed the
"Agreement to Sell" - approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources). He has not even submitted any plau­sible explanation for
the delay in filing his protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The division of lot 26 containing an area of only 125.7 square
meters into two lots of 68.7 and 57 sq. meters, instead of enhancing the
purpose of Commonwealth Act 539, Acts 1170 and 1933 (Friar Lands Acts) and
Corn. Acts 20, 26 and 378 (<span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> Acts), which is
to sell to a person the land on which his house stands,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and afford him an opportunity to become the owner of a home and a residential
lot,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
would defeat the very letter of the Said legislative enactments. This Court
held in Grande and Josef vs. Santos and Santos and Director of Lands,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that a 144-square­meter lot "is barely enough for a single family,"
and that to subdivide it into three separate lots "may, and, in all
probability would lead to frictions, conflicts, misunderstandings and, per­haps,
disturbances of the peace, which are precisely sought to be averted by
Commonwealth Act No. 539," and concluded that adjudicating the entire
144-square-meter lot to <span class="SpellE">Dalisay</span> Santos is in
consonance "With either the letter, or the spirit, of said legis­lative
enactment."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is reversed;
the order of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Land Tenure Administration
of November 13, 1956 in LTC Case 100, entitled "Lorenzo Cabrera versus <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">An­tonel</span>," the
