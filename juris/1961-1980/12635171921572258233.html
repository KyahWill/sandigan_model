				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in its Criminal Case No. V-8884, convicting the
appellant <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>
of the crime of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="2">February
 17, 1962</st1:date>, a card game known as "pares-pares" was held at
a certain gambling house in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tungasan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among those present therein were the appel­lant
<span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>, the
other accused, <span class="SpellE">Anasta­cio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>,
who pleaded guilty, <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala, Alberto Belle,
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span> and Federico <span class="SpellE">Alcuizar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant who owned the cards being used in
the game, was the shuf­fler, banker and dealer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>, seve­ral
players had already lost their money, among them <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> and <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In apparent disgust, Gala tore one of the
cards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This angered appellant who
immediately asked him why he did it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Verbal alterca­tions followed among appellant, Gala and the other
players.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alberto Belle suggested to
appellant the use of the joker in lieu of the torn card.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Anas­tacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> suddenly stabbed Gala <span style="">on the back from be­</span>hind <span style="">with
his knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commotion </span>ensued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later <span style="">that
same </span>evening, Gala was found already dead at a <span style="">distance of </span>about 15 meters from the gambling house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="2">February
 18, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>
surrendered to the police authorities of <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He executed a statement (Exhibit A) admitting hav­ing stabbed the
deceased Regina Gala in the back <span style="">from </span>be­hind
and implicating appellant thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Earlier
that evening of the incident, appellant instructed him to stab anyone who would
take trouble during the card game, and so, when the deceased Gala tore one of
the cards <span style="">and appellant <span class="SpellE">sig­<span style="">nalled</span></span></span>
him, he immediately drew his knife and drove it into the body of said
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span> and Alberto <span class="SpellE">Balle</span>
executed also affidavits narrat­ing the <span style="">incident
which </span>led to the <span style="">killing of </span>the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Their narration, however, mentioned </span>nothing about any sig­nal
allegedly given by appellant to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maisug</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1962</st1:date>,
an information for the murder of <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala was
filed against <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>
and appel­lant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged therein
that on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1962</st1:date>,
both accused "with deliberate intent to kill, evident pre­<span style="">meditation and </span>treachery, conspiring
and confabulating with each other", stabbed from behind the deceased <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala, "thereby <span style="">inflicting </span>upon the latter a stab wound at the left side of the
portion of his body which pro­duced his death." Upon arraignment, accused <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> plead­ed guilty to the charge and asked permission
to prove mitigating circumstances which he claimed attended the com­mission of
the offense or his liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
permission granted, he proved and the court considered three mitiga­ting
circumstances, namely, voluntary surrender, plea of guilty and drunkenness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the lower court sentenced him on
April 16, 1962, to a penalty of four (4) years <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>, as minimum, to eight (8) years <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><u><span style=""> mayor</span></u><span style="">, </span>as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the
sum of P6,000 and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant, on the other hand, pleaded not guilty, hence trial was held
as to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="6">June
 28, 1963</st1:date> the lower court rendered the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the court:</p>

<blockquote>"Based on what appears on record, the Court is convinced that
the cri­minal participation of the accused <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tado</span> in the commission of the offense charged in the
information against him and his co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>, has been clearly and positively established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that it was the said ac­cused,
<span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>, who
owned the torn playing card; that the said accused was mad at the deceased <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala when this tore the said card for no justifiable
reason known to said ac­cused; and that due to the act of said deceased, the
game was stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence further
shows that he (<span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span>) was the dealer who
shuffled and distributed the gaming cards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to his own admission, he and the manager or owner of the game,
Emilio Mature, had the understanding that whatever tong was collected in the
game played that night would be divided bet­ween them equally; and that when
the game was stopped no more tong was col­lected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, finds and declares that the
accused <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>
par­ticipated as principal by induction be­cause he was the one who instructed
and <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
to stab the deceased (Art. 248, par. 1, Revised, Penal Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The allegation of conspiracy and con­fabulation made in the
information against both has been clearly shown and establish­ed by the
coordinated acts of both accused such as the fact that, in the early hour of
that evening of the incident, there was an understanding between both accused
that the accused <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>
would stab anyone making trouble in the course of the card game; and that after
the deceased <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala tore the card belonging to
the dealer <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>,
the latter immediately gave the 'go signal' to the other accused to stab the
trouble maker who happened to be the said deceased, <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
Gala.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of stabbing the deceased was
characterized by treachery because it was done from behind when the victim was
unaware and not in a position to defend himself while the attacker was behind
without exposing himself to any risk arising from the defense that the victim
may put up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the charge of the fis­cal
against both accused is murder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, based on all the fore­going considerations, the
Court finds and declares the accused <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span> guilty, beyond reasonable doubt, as principal by
induction, of the <span style="">of­fense </span>of
murder charged in the infor­mation, and said offense is the same crime defined
and penalized under Art­icle 248 of the Revised Penal Code and, considering the
absence of any modify­ing circumstance, the said accused is hereby sentenced to
serve the penalty of life imprisonment (reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>)
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala in
the sum of P6,000.00; and to pay one-half of the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appear­ing that said accused <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span> has been
confined in jail since his ar­rest on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="2">February
 18, 1962</st1:date>, up to the present time, he is entitled to be credited
with one-half of his total preventive confinement, and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weapon, Exhibit C, and its scabbard,
Exhibit C-1 recovered from the accused are ordered confiscated and forfeited in
favor of the government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the whole, the appeal
should be sustained and appellant given the benefit of reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span><span style="">clear </span><span style="">from a careful perusal of the record that the only <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
evidence against appellant <span class="SpellE">Tado</span> are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the statement of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> in his extrajudicial confession (Exhibit A)
that early that evening of February 17, 1962, appellant instructed him to stab
anyone who would make trouble during the card game; that when the deceased tore
one playing card, the appellant got angry and <span class="SpellE">signalled</span>
him to stab said de­ceased; and that in compliance with such signal, he
immediately drew his knife and drove it into the body of the said deceased; and
(2) the testimony of Alberto <span class="SpellE">Balle</span> to the effect that
after the deceased tore one of the cards, he saw the appellant give signal to <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> </span>to stab said deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court considered these as
sufficient proof of conspiracy and/or inducement, and consequently, held
appellant liable for the confessed criminal act of <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court sees appellant's case differently.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the record stands, <span class="SpellE">Maisug's</span>
confession which was relied upon by the trial court cannot be considered as suf­ficiently
dependable evidence to convict appellant, as the trial court did, of such a
grave offense as murder and de­prive him of liberty for life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>
him­self repudiated in open court the portions of his confession incriminating
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And We are satisfied that his
testimony in open court when he declared at the sepa­rate hearing for the
presentation of his evidence to prove mitigating circumstances, after pleading
guilty,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
was more candid and natural than his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He straight­forwardly owned the killing of
the deceased and denied having been <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> by
appellant to do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I killed him
by my own volition.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It was my own volition to
kill him", he told the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
quote further from the trans­cript of his testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>Did he make any provocation on you?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>What was the provocation?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
he tore the cards, he uttered these words:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Who among you here is brave enough to challenge me?'</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
of that provocation, you imme­diately stabbed him?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir." (TSN, p. 4, <span class="SpellE">Sabarre</span>)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>x
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>So when you said that when the deceased <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala tore the cards, it was <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tado</span> who was angered of the act of the deceased, is
that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
<span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span> was
angered, you were <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> by him to stab the
deceased according to your affidavit?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not, instead I killed him by my own
volition." (TSN, p. 6 <span class="SpellE">Sabarre</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>Having
already seen the owner, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>, who was angered of the tearing of the cards, what brought
or what motivated you to <span style="">stab the
deceased when there is the owner of the card who was already angered?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">ATTY. DAKAY:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">It was already answered by the wit­ness
in the direct examination that he was provoked by the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">COURT:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Witness may answer.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I killed him because I did not like his
attitude in tearing the cards." (TSN, p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Sabarre</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the alleged <span class="SpellE">signalling</span> of
appellant to <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> for him to stab the deceased does
not appear to be clearly proven in the prosecution's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the con­fession of <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> is this fact satisfactorily clarified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that appears therein relative to this
point is the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>Will you state if there was any un­usual
happening during the time you were at the game of <span class="SpellE">paris-paris</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I was there many people were playing the
game of cards commonly known as <span class="SpellE">paris-paris</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also made some bets and I lost Fifty
Centavos (P.50).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another person named <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala also lost in the betting and the latter tore
out one playing card.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the
cards who is <span class="SpellE">Hildo</span> a very close friend of mine was
angered by this incident and he <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> to me to
stab <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
this <span class="SpellE">Hildo</span> know that you had a dagger at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Yes, sir, as we were close friend he knew
that I carry my dagger all the time.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
you then comply with the signal made by your friend <span class="SpellE">Hildo</span>
to strike at <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala with your dagger?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, as I had taken in a certain amount
of liquor, I did not need much coaxing, I draw my dagger and with both hands, I
drove my dagger into the body of <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala from
behind, hit­ting him on the left side of his back.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
did <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala do after hitting him on the back with
your dagger?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
ran towards the lower ground.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do
you know this person which you call <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No,
sir, I saw him for the first time only last night.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
you have any quarrel with this fellow <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No,
sir, I did not have any quarrel with him.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
you have previous instruction or under­standing with <span class="SpellE">Hildo</span>,
to stab <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was instructed by <span class="SpellE">Hildo</span>
early that eve­ning to stab anyone who make trouble in his card games and as it
was <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala who made trouble by tearing into
pieces a playing card and as <span class="SpellE">Hildo</span> made the signal I
immediately complied and drove my dagger into the body of <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
Gala." (Exhibit <span style="">A)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can thus be noted that <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> gave
no indications whatsoever as to what was the particular signal to be given to
him by appellant as well as the one which was actually given later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less did he do this during his
testimony, because, as already stated, he categorically denied having been
given any signal by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an obvious attempt to have a corroboration of <span class="SpellE">Maisug's</span> confession on this point, the prosecution pre­sented
the witness Alberto <span class="SpellE">Balle</span> who testified thereon as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>Why do you say he agreed with an angry mood?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
agreed with a nodding sign, but with a signal to <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
signal?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>With a sign doing this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(INTER­PRETER:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness holding his right, standing, with
fist closed and mak­ing a stabbing motion, thrusting forward.)" <span style="">(TSN, </span>p. 4, Perez)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">only to admit in the next breath that:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>You mentioned <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> being <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> by <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span> with a stabbing
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What did you understand by that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do
not know the meaning of it." <span style="">(TSN,
</span>pp. 4-5, Perez)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Further, during the cross-examination, this witness admitted that
when his statement was first taken by the police after the incident, he made no
reference to the alleged <span class="SpellE">signalling</span> by appellant to <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> although he explain­ed that this was because he was
not asked about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is
nothing in said statement which in anyway implicat­ed appellant, as there was
not even any mention of him therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a matter of fact, <span class="SpellE">Balle</span> did not even say in said
statement that <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> was the one who stabbed the de­ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only reference to <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>
therein was as fol­lows:</p>

<blockquote>"That I asked my companions to go with me home, and when I
stood up to go, I saw Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span> run and
stumbled, then I saw one man now known to me to be <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> brandishing his dagger." (par. 6,
Affidavit of Alberto <span class="SpellE">Balle</span>, p. 3, Trial Court's

<p class="BODY">Adding weakness to his evidence, was his admission that it was
only in court that he first told anyone about such fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were true, how come <span style="">that the </span>fiscal presented him <span style="">as witness </span>against appellant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A wit­ness who denies having revealed to the
counsel presenting him at the trial the matter he would testify on is not worthy
of credence, for such testimony is unnatural and contrary to ordinary <span style="">experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Lawyers do not usually present witnesses without informing
themselves regarding the facts that they would prove in the testimonies they
would give in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is specially
true in this case because, without that detail <span style="">about the </span>signal in question, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Balle'</span>s</span><span style=""> </span>testimony was of no particular consequence in the government's
case and if the fiscal did not know about said signal, it is difficult to
understand why he would still present said witness <span style="">as, in fact, </span>he did <span style="">present
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, later in the same cross-examination, Belle reiterated
that he did not understand the signal and gave the following vague explanation:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>When you said Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tado</span> made <span style="">a </span>for­ward
motion of his hand you did not know what that meant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that not right?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are right.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>As a matter of fact, you <span style="">did
not </span>even know that that was a signal?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he made a sign in this manner (INTERPRETER:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness made <span style="">a </span>thrust) immediately Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span>
ran away.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>But you did not know for a fact that that was a signal?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Later) Please answer my question.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do
not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that </span>sense.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>And the next thing <span style="">that you
saw was </span>Mr. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span> running in this <span style="">direction </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">indicated by you in
this Exhibit "D".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that
right?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A</span><span style="">.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Right.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>And, of course, you were surprised why Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span>
was running in that direction?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why I turned to one side.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>And when you turned your head you saw Mr. <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> standing on the spot indicated by you in this
Exhibit "D" holding his knife?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is right.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>In other words, you did not actually see Mr. <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> stab <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are
right.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>As a matter of fact, you do not know for a fact that <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala in response to the supposed signal of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I know for a fact is that when the signal was made there was a
commotion at once and that means there must be a stabbing.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style=""> </span>But you did not actually see the exact moment when <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> Gala?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not know the cause of the commo­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I noted somebody running I ran after
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY.
FERNANDEZ:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you wish
this Court to understand that the moment you became aware of the commotion was
when you saw Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bre­gente</span> running away already
in the direct­ion you indicated in this Exhibit "D"?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span>,
he was the one who actually saw the stabbing, that is why he ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his running away I ran after him on my
belief that he was the one stabbed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When you ran after Mr. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span> you did not know for <span style="">a </span>fact that there was already somebody stabbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You are right." (TSN, pp. 16-17, Perez)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ambiguity and inconclusiveness of the proof as to the alleged
<span class="SpellE">signalling</span> by appellant to <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>
is pivotal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such evidence, without more,
except the repudiated confession of <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>, cannot
make proof beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case would have been otherwise, had there been clear proof that the
corroborating witness <span class="SpellE">Balle</span> knew what exactly the
signal was and this coincided with the signal confessed by <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To convict appellant on mere vague testimony
about a signal, allegedly to kill the deceased, when (1) such sup­posed signal
does not appear to be even intimated in the circumstances related in the
extrajudicial statement of the government witness; (2) the fiscal was never
made aware of it; and (3) where said witness himself admitted at the trial
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.-<span style=""> </span>When you said Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>
made a forward motion of his hand you did not know what that meant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that not right?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
are right.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, you did not even know that that was <span style="">a </span>signal?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he made a sign in this manner (INTERPRETER:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>witness made a thrust) immediately Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Bregente</span>
ran away.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
you did not know for <span style="">a fact </span>that
that was a signal?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Later) Please answer
my question.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do
not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense." <span style="">(TSN, </span><span style="">p.16, </span>Perez)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">would be basing conviction on mere
inference which can hardly be said to be reasonable, much less in capable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the proof that <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> fully
understood every part of his so-called extrajudicial confession con­vincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be borne in mind is the important
consideration that since <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> is an unschooled
farmer who does not know how to read and can write only his name because he was
<span style="">taught </span>to do so by his mother,
his said confession which is in English had to be read and translated to him
allegedly by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pris­cillano</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Lumapas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
multiple process of reading <span style="">and </span>translating
the questions and translating and typing the answers and reading and
translating again the said answers is naturally pregnant with possibilities of
human, if unintentional, inadequacies and incompleteness which render the said
confession unsafe as basis of conviction for a capital offense, unless <span style="">sufficiently </span>corroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is notable that in this case, the fiscal
dispensed with the presentation of the justice of the peace before whom <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> allegedly swore his confession, since it is not even
definite from the testimony of the chief of police <span style="">whether </span><span class="SpellE">Maisug</span> signed the same before
him alone, or before <span style="">the justice of the
peace in his presence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By and large, the </span>evidence
on record does not en­gender enough faith that appellant <span style="">is </span>guilty of the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If somehow it is discernible that it is more
the inade<span style="">quacy of details in the
state’s evidence that makes it difficult for Us to arrive at definite
conclusions rather than, perhaps, </span>the <span style="">actual facts themselves, </span>still We cannot pin responsibility on
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The moral convict­ion that
may serve as basis of <span style="">a </span>finding
of guilt in criminal cases is only that which is the logical and inevitable
result of the evidence on record, exclusive of any other con­sideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Short of this, it is not only the right of the
accused to be freed, it is, even more, our constitutional duty to acquit him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of this Court is that the guilt of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Herminigildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tado</span>
of the crime charged in this case has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt; <span style="">he is hereby </span>acquitted; and it <span style="">is ordered that he be set </span>immediately
at liberty unless <span style="">he is held for
