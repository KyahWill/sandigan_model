				<H3>JOSE F. ZAMORA
(GOLDEN TAXICAB), PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS AND
THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by petitioner Jose F. Zamora from a decision of the
Court of Tax Appeals upholding an assessment made against him by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue - hereinafter referred to as Respondent - in
the sum of P23,103.85, as deficiency com­pensating tax, and ordering him to pay
the same, as well as from a resolution of said Court denying Petitioner's
motion for reconsi­deration of the aforementioned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that, in February 1958, Petitioner, who owns and
operates a fleet of taxicabs known as Golden Taxicab, im­ported fifteen (15)
units of Ford Consul Sedan, in completely knocked down (CKD) parts, for the use
of his company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The im­portation was
released from customs' custody upon payment by Petitioner of 7% of the gross
selling price or value of the imported parts, as compensating tax thereon, and
the filing of a bond to guarantee the payment of deficiency tax, in the event
the shipment is subject to a 50% compensating tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime later, Respondent notified the
Petitioner that the rate imposable upon his importation is 50% and requested
settlement of the deficiency tax on the ship­ment in question, in such amount
as may be computed by the Bureau of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A reconsideration of the action thus taken by Respon­dent having been denied,
Petitioner appealed, on <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1960</st1:date>,
to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of such appeal, or on <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1961</st1:date>, Respondent assessed and
demanded from Petitioner the payment of P23,103.85, as deficiency compensating
tax on the aforementioned shipment, computed at the rate of 50% of its
aforementioned value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course,
thereafter, said Court rendered its decision upholding the contested assessment
and order­ing Petitioner to pay the sum of P23,103.85, as deficiency compen­sating
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion for reconsideration of
said decision having been denied, Petitioner filed the present petition for
review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question for our determination is whether the rate of
compensating tax applicable to the importation in question is 50 <u>per</u> <u>centum</u>
of the gross money value thereof, as prescribed in Section 184(a) of the
National Internal Revenue Code, or 7 <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> of said value, as
provided in Section 186 of the same Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time material to the case at bar, the pertinent parts of these
sections read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 184. <u>Percentage tax on sales of jewelry, automobiles,
toilet preparations and others</u>.- There shall be levied, assessed, and
collected once only on every original sale, barter, exchange, or similar
transaction for nominal or valuable consider­ations intended to transfer
ownership of, or title to, the articles herein below enumerated a tax equiva­lent
to 50% of the gross value in money of the arti­cles so sold, bartered,
exchanged, or transferred, such tax to be paid by the manufacturer or
producer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a) Automobile chassis and bodies, the selling price of which
does not exceed seven thou­sand pesos; <u>Provided</u>, That where the selling
price of an automobile exceeds seven thousand pesos but does not exceed ten
thousand pesos the same shall be taxed at the rate of seventy-five <u>per cen­tum</u>
of such selling price:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>And provided,
further</u>, That where the selling price of an automobile ex­ceeds ten
thousand pesos the same shall be taxed at the rate of one hundred <u>per</u> <u>centum</u>
of such sell<span style="">ing price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sale of automobile shall, for the purpose
of this section, be considered to be a sale of the chassis and of the body
together with parts and accessories with which the same </span><span style="">are </span>usually equipped:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided, however</u>, That parts and
accessories of automobiles imported as replacements or as completely knocked
down parts as well as locally manufactured parts and accessories for the
assembly of automobiles shall be subject to tax under section one hundred and
eighty-six:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>And</u> <u>provided,
further</u>, That the total cost of such materials or parts on which tax has
already been paid under section one hun­dred and eighty-six, as duly
established, shall be deductible from the gross selling price or gross value in
money of the as­sembled or manufactured articles:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 186. <u>Percentage tax on sales of other articles</u>. -
There shall be levied, assessed and collected once only on every original sale,
barter, exchange, and simi­lar transaction either for nominal or valuable
considerations, intended to transfer owner­ship of, or title to, the articles
not enume­rated in sections one hundred and eighty-four and one hundred and
eighty-five, a tax equivalent to seven <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> of the gross
selling price or gross value in money of the articles so sold, bartered,
exchanged, or transferred, such tax to be paid by the ma­nufacturer or
producer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That where
the articles subject to tax under this section are manufactured out of
materials likewise subject to tax under this section and section one hundred
and eighty-nine, the total cost of such materials, as duly established, shall
be deductible from the gross selling price or gross value in money of such
manufactured articles. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is urged that the theory of Respondent, adopted by the Court
of Tax Appeals - to the effect that, insofar as automobile parts and
accessories are concerned, the rate of 7 <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> prescribed in
Section 186 applies only to importers engaged in the manufacture or assembly of
automobiles - is untenable, be­cause importations similar to those involved in
the present case, made by the Petitioner in the past, had uniformly been
subjected to said rate, and because, in making the importation in dispute, he
had relied on General Circular No. V-208 of the then Bureau of In­ternal Revenue,
dated May 24, 1956, which is of the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"GENERAL CIRCULAR NO.
V-<u>208</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>To all internal revenue officers
and others concerned</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For the information and guidance of all inter­nal revenue
officers and others concerned, there is quoted hereunder an opinion of the
Secretary of Finance contained in his letter to this Office dated May 24, 1956,
regarding the advance sales tax collectible on importations of automobile,
whether already assembled or chassis and bodies ready for mounting under sec­tions
184 and 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'With reference to my letter to you dated February 24, 1956,
regarding the advanced sales taxes which are applic­able to imported
automobiles, I wish to clarify and reiterate my view that impor­tations of
assembled automobiles for re­sale as well as importations of chassis and bodies
ready for mounting, are sub­ject to the advanced sales taxes pre­scribed under
sections 184 and 185 of the Tax Code.</p>

<p class="2Q">'It should be carefully noted that this refers to importations of
automobiles al­ready assembled and chassis and bodies ready for mounting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This does not refer to importations of parts
and accessories for replacement or maintenance of automobiles or CKD component
parts for the manufacture of automobiles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such parts and accessories of automobiles are imported as raw materials
and not as automobiles, and are consequent­ly subject only to 7% sales tax
under section 186 of the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
importation of auto­mobile chassis and/or bodies ready for mount­ing, however,
is to be considered as impor­tation of automobiles and not of parts and
accessories as may be inferred from section 184(a) of the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="2Q">'For the purposes of this letter, chassis and bodies may be defined
as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">‘(1) Chassis as applied to a motor car means:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The rectangular metal frame­work, as
distinguished from its body and seats, but including its accessories for
propulsion, as the tanks, motor, etc., and general running gear.' (Kansas City
Automobile School Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Holcker</span> <span class="SpellE">Elberg</span>
Mfg. Co., No., 182 S.W. 759,761).</p>

<p class="2Q">‘(2) Body as applied to a motor car means:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The metal shell, interior trim, seats,
cowl, hood, fenders, grille, doors, windows and windshield, etc. '</p>

<p class="2Q">'When a car is manufactured out of im­ported materials (parts and
accessories), it shall be subject to the quarterly sales tax prescribed under
either section 184 or section 185 of the Tax Code, after proper deductions have
been allowed for the total cost of the parts and accessories on which sales tax
had already been paid.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Importations of automobiles, whether already assembled or chassis
and bodies ready for mounting, come under sections 184 and 185.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Importations of automobile parts and
accessories and CKD component parts come under section 186.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Please be guided accordingly in the implementation of my letter
referred to above.'</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> opinion
of the Se­cretary of Finance, imported automobiles, whether already assembled
or chassis and bodies ready for mounting, shall be subject to the advance sales
tax prescribed by sections 184 and 185 of the National Internal Revenue Code
based on the landed cost thereof, plus the corresponding mark up established by
section 183 (B) of the same Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, importations of automobile parts and accessories for <span style="">replacement or maintenance of automobiles of
CKD component parts for the manufacture of automobiles shall be subject to the
advance sales tax prescribed by section 186 of the National Internal Revenue
Code based on the landed cost thereof, plus the 25% mark-up established by
section 183 (B) of the same Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a
car is manufac­tured out of imported materials (parts and acces­sories), the
gross selling price of the manufac­tured car, after proper deductions shall
have been allowed for the total cost of the parts and accessories on which the
advance sales tax has already been paid, shall be subject to the rate of the
tax prescribed by sections 184 and 185 of the National Internal Revenue Code.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This circular does not, however, bear out Petitioner's
pretense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as explicitly stated
in the circular:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx I wish to clarify and reiterate my view that importations

<p class="BODY">It is not contended by Petitioner that the shipment in ques­tion
has been imported "for the manufacture of automobiles." Ac­cordingly,
he was not justified in relying upon the circular in sup­port of his
contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, in his opinion No. 44, Series of 1963, the
Secretary of Justice expressed the following view:</p>

<blockquote>"The Bureau of Internal Revenue holds the view that the
reduced 7% sales tax rate may be availed of <u>only by car assemblers and
manufacturers</u> who import parts and accessories <u>for the purpose of
assembling cars</u> and that where the said parts and accessories are imported
by one who is <u>not</u> an assembler or manufacturer the tax that should be
paid is the usual rate of <u>50%</u>, but where the importer is also the
end-user, as in the instant case, the tax due is the <u>compensating</u> and <u>not</u>
the advance sales tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the Munoz (Hi) Motors, Inc., asserts that the importation in question
should be entitled to the reduced tax rate of 7% on the ground that it comes
within the purview of the underscored proviso of section 184(a) there being an
importation of completely knocked-down parts in­tended for the assembly of
automobiles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After an examination of the above-quoted provisions, we have
come to the conclusion that the view of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is the <u>correct
</u>one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the first
paragraph of section 184 'such tax to [shall] be paid by the <u>ma­nufacturer
or producer'</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the reduced tax
payable pursuant to the proviso under considera­tion of paragraph (a) of the
same section should be deemed to have been provided <u>for the benefit of the
said 'manufacturer or producer</u>'.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This view finds ample support in the con­ference report,
quoted below, of the committee which prepared House Bill No. 5809 (now Republic
Act No. 1612):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Report consolidates into one paragraph all provisions covering tax
on automobile chassis and bodies, so as to avoid confusion in the manner and
rate of taxing locally-assembled cars.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With that, Mr. President, there has been confusion in the manner of imposing
tax on assembled cars here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spare
parts were made to pay taxes, and when the assembled cars were sold, a luxury
tax is imposed on the assembled cars, so that in effect, the <u>industry</u> is
paying two kinds of taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this
conference report, <u>we consolidated all these pro­visions, so that the tax
paid on spare parts are deductible when these parts are assembled into finished
cars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the assembling industry
here would be paying two kinds of taxes</u>, which is contrary to the basic
philosophy of our taxation system; and second, with that kind of double taxa­tion,
these cars would have to be sold at exorbitant prices. x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> ' (Senate Congressional Record, July 11, 1956, p.
305; Underscoring supplied.)'</p>

<blockquote>"It is quite evident that it was the legislative purpose to do
away with the practice then prevalent in taxing twice locally assembled
cars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A tax was collected initially on
the spare parts and accessories, and another on the assembled car when it was
sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the amendment, the tax
paid on the spare parts and accessories would be 'deductible when these parts
are assembled into finished cars'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>End-users
who are not car assemblers or manufacturers do not fall within the purview of
this amendment since they would be required to pay only the tax assessable on
the CKD parts and accessories.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Besides, the interpretation urged by the Munoz (Hi) Motors,
Inc., would result in gross inequality in the taxation of the same
article.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A car locally manufactured from
spare parts and ac­cessories imported by one who is not an assembler or manufacturer,
would be subject only to the 7% tax and no more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if the spare parts were
imported by an assembler or manufacturer, besides being subject to the 7% tax,
the difference in value between the spare parts and the finished product would
still be subject to the regular rate of tax, 50% or more, as the case may
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a situation which could not
have been within the legislative contemplation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, <u>this would indirectly open the door to circumven­tion of
the law by the simple expedient of making </u><u><span style="">it appear that the end-user, and not the assembler or manufacturer, is
the importer of the spare parts and accessories.<o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote><u><span style="">"It is stated that
during the era of import and exchange controls the Central Bank limited the importation
of CKD units to car assemblers </span></u><span style="">and
did not allow their importation by ordinary importers and end-users.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See letter of Munoz (Hi) Motors, Inc. to the
BIR, dated July 18, 1962.) This bolsters the conclusion that <u>the reduced tax
rate of 7% may be availed of only by importers who are car assem­blers or
manufacturers</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 1612
was passed during this time of controls and statutes should be construed in the
light of contemporary events existing at the time of their passage and not in
the light of subsequent events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See 82
CJS 739-743; 50 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 276-277.)"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is argued that section 190 of the National Internal Reve­nue
Code "does not make a distinction between an importer who is a
manufacturer or car assembler and an importer who is not a manu­facturer or
assembler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>" However, "parts
and accessories of auto­mobiles" are subject to the 7% rate, under section
186, by virtue only of the first proviso in subdivision (a) of section 184,
which limits the application of said section 186 to "parts and accessories
of automobiles imported as replacements or as completely knocked down parts <u>for
the assembly of automobiles</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> . " Indeed, this qualification is in consonance with
the spirit and letter of section 186, which provides that the rate therein
fixed shall be "paid by the <u>manufacturer or producer</u>." In
other words, it is not intended for the end-user or consumer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would have been no reason to insert the
aforementioned qualification, and the same would not have been made, had the
purpose of the proviso been to apply section 186 to the importation of parts
and accessories of auto­mobiles as completely knocked down parts, regardless of
whether or not the importer was an automobile manufacturer or assembler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view taken in the appealed decision is
further bolstered up by the subsequent proviso, in section 184(a), to the
effect that "the total cost of such materials or parts <u>on which tax has
al­ready been paid under section one hundred and eighty-six</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall be deductible from the gross
selling price or gross value in money of the <u>assembled</u> or <u>manufactured</u>
articles x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, it is not difficult to understand why the application
of the 7 <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> rate was limited only to importations made by
those engaged in the manufacture and assembly of auto­mobiles - the Government
wanted to encourage the establishment of factories or plants for the
manufacture or assembly of automo­biles in the Philippines, to increase job
opportunities for local laborers and mechanics and reduce the drain on our
dollar reserve resulting from the purchase of foreign-made automobiles.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the 7% compensating tax applied to pre­vious
similar importations <span style="">of </span>the
Petitioner is not and cannot be controlling <span style="">in </span>the case at bar. Well-settled is the rule that errors
committed by public officers can not be set up as <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
against the Government or bar its future action in accordance with law.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>
