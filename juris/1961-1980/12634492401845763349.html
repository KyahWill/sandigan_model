				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A petition for mechanization of a 45-hectare rice-land in <st1:place>Canaan</st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, was filed by <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mipalar</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="1">January
 28, 1963</st1:date> in the Court of Agrarian Re­lations against the fourteen
tenants thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said petition stated that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner-landowner <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mipalar</span> had previously sent notices to said ten­ants in
writing in the dialect known to them of his in­tention to cultivate the
landholdings thru the use of farm machineries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondents-tenants received these notices on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1961</st1:date> and <u>subsequent</u> dates, the
last being <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And earlier, on <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mipalar</span> filed notice with the Court of Agrarian Relations,
stating his intention to cultivate the same landholdings thru the use of farm
machineries.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion to dismiss was filed by <span class="GramE">respondents</span>
ten­ants on the ground that the petition for mechanization was filed beyond the
<span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of two years as required by law
(Sec. 50[a], R.A. 1199 as amended).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting thereon, the Court of Agrarian Relations, on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1964</st1:date>, dismissed the case, sustaining
the ground afore-stated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner-landowner now appeals from the dismissal order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 50(a) of Republic Act 1199, as amended, provides that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 50.</span> <span class="GramE"><u>Causes for
the Dispossession of Tenant</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Any of the following, and no other, shall be sufficient cause for the
dis­possession of a tenant from his holdings:</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"(a) The <u>bona</u>
<u>fide</u> intention of the land­holder-owner or his relative within the first
degree by consanguinity to cultivate the land himself personally or through the
employment of farm machinery and implements:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>Pro­vided</u>,
<u>further</u>, That the landholder-owner or the aforesaid relative shall, at
least one year but not more than two years prior to the date of his petition to
dispossess the tenant under this subsection, file notice with the court and
shall inform the tenant in writing in a language or dialect known to the latter
of his intention to cultivate the land him­self, either personally or through
the employment of mechanical implements:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</p>

<p class="BODY">The statute plainly requires that <u>within</u> the period
therein stated, two notices <span class="GramE">be</span> made:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to the Court of Agrarian Relations; <u>and</u>
(2) to the tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, if
notice to the court is within the period but notice to the tenant is outside
the same; or if notice to the tenant falls inside the period but notice to the
court lies beyond it, the statutory requisites of notices are not complied
with, and the petition cannot be entertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, notices to the tenants were made within the
abovementioned period, that is, at least one year but not more than two years
prior to the filing of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
so, however, with the notice to the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was filed <u>more</u> than two years prior to the filing of the
petition for mechanization; to be pre­cise, two years <u>and one month</u> non-compliance
with the requirements of Section 50(a) before such filing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that for non-compliance with the
requirements of Section 50(a) on notices, requisites that are substantive, not
merely procedural (<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Alzate</span>,
98 Phil. 781), the petition was rightly dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would contend that a liberal interpreta­tion should be
followed, and the two-year period should be considered in relation to <u>either</u>
of the notices, or whichever is later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The statute uses the word "and" not "or".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interpretation of Republic Act 1199,
more­over, all doubts are to be solved in favor of the ten­ant (Sec. 56, R.A.
1199).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And while it would be favor­able
to the tenant to count the <u>one-year period</u>, <u>before</u> which the
petition cannot be filed, from whichever notice comes later, it would be
unfavorable to him to count the <u>two-year period</u>, <u>after</u> which the
petition cannot be filed, from whichever notice is later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while in the first case, the tenant would
in effect have a longer time to stay on the land, in the second case, the
landholder-owner would be given a longer period to ask for his
dispossession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prevent such
unfavorable effects on the tenant, such as, for instance, the filing of the
petition after one year from notice to the court, but less than one year from
notice to the tenant; or, as in this case, more than two years from notice to
the court, the rule should be, in accordance with the statute's obvious import,
that <u>both</u> notices should be made within the period laid down at least
one year but not more than two years prior to the filing of the petition to
dispossess under Sec. 50(a) of R.A. 1199.</p>
