<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pedro Bonilla was employed as a 
<span class="SpellE">latheman</span> (machinist-mechanic) in the Engineering 
Department of Franklin Baker Company sometime in September, 1952. His work was 
irregular but his average weekly wage was P39.20. On January 20, 1961, while 
tightening the independent chuck of the lathe, he felt pain in his "<span class="SpellE">puson</span>" and scrotum for which reason the company physician 
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Gesmundo</span> 
recommended his hospitalization. He was confined at the San Pablo City Hospital 
where he was treated for hernia for about seven days. He returned to work on 
February 6, 1961, but after working for about five hours, he stopped because he 
again felt pain in his scrotum. On June 2, 1961, he was operated on for hernia 
and was released from the hospital on June 12, 1961. He resumed his work on July 
29, 1961 but later was not able to continue for which reason he was given an aid 
in the amount of P294.26 as benefit under the company's non-occupational sick 
leave plan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As a consequence of his sickness, 
Bonilla filed a claim for compensation before Regional Office No. 5 of San Pablo 
City of which his employer was duly notified. The latter, while admitting that 
claimant had been confined for sometime at the San Pablo City Hospital, claims 
that he was not treated for hernia but of some bodily injury and of chicken pox. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After the claim was heard on the 
merits, Hearing Officer Domingo A. Reyes rendered decision approving the claim 
and ordering the employer to pay claimant the sum of P512.02 minus the amount of 
P294.26 which was already given him under the employer's non-occupational 
disability plan, plus the amount of P5.00 as filing fee and the amount of P25.00 
as attorney's fees. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On appeal taken by the employer 
to the Workmen's Compensation Commission, Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span> Perez reversed the decision on the ground that there 
is no causal relationship between the sickness of claimant and the nature of his 
work. This decision was affirmed by the Commission <i>en banc</i>. The case is 
now before us on a petition for review. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The only issue to be determined 
is whether the sickness of hernia which claimant had suffered during his 
employment arose out of, or was aggravated by, the nature of his work and as 
such is subject to compensation under the law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There seems to be no dispute that 
the sickness of hernia suffered by claimant started while he was still a student 
with the result that when he began working with respondent company as a <span class="SpellE">latheman</span> or a machinist-mechanic sometime in September, 1952 
that sickness had already been contracted. However, it was only on January 20, 
1961, or after the lapse of 9 years and 4 months, that claimant: complained of 
the recurrence of that sickness for which reason he was hospitalized. 
Significantly, during that interregnum, claimant did not make any complaint nor 
did ho ever bring to the attention of the employer's physician that he was 
suffering from that sickness. This long silence has given rise to the impression 
that the recurrence of the sickness was not really due to the nature of the work 
of the claimant but simply to ordinary causes that come forth because of daily 
wear and tear of the human body as a concomitant result of his work in the shop 
of the company. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nevertheless, to determine in a 
manner that may set the mind at rest as to the existence, if any, of the causal 
relation between claimant's sickness and his work, the employer referred the 
case to the Evaluation Division of the Workmen's Compensation Commission for a 
medical opinion. And on September 5, 1962, Dr. Fidel M. <span class="SpellE">Gilatco</span>, concurred in by Dr. Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Santillan</span>, both of the same office, submitted a report on 
the matter wherein an enlightening and exhaustive study of the sickness of 
hernia in relation to its compensability was made, which we hereunder quote for 
ready reference: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We could not, for a moment, 
believe that such straining would have caused its hernia, since it has been 
shown by the following testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gesmundo</span> that 
this condition has been <span class="GramE">existing</span> for a long time. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"If the nature of his work which 
he has been doing since 1952 would really aggravate his pre-existing hernia, it 
would not have waited for almost ten long years before he became bothered by 
pains in the '<span class="SpellE">puson</span>' and 
scrotum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The <i>pre-requisites for the 
compensability of hernia</i> which our Division has been following, and which 
have almost become the standard criteria in workmen's compensation in the U.S. 
and Canada, are the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'1. That the hernia is of recent 
origin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. That its appearance was 
accompanied by pain, discoloration, and evidence of a tearing of the tissue. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">3. That it was immediately 
preceded by some strain oat of and in the course of employment 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">4. That a protrusion or mass 
appeared in the area immediately following the alleged strain.' <span class="GramE">(Occupational Diseases by <span class="SpellE">Johnstone</span>.</span> W.B. Saunders Co., 1942, pp. 421-424) 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In the case of Perfecto Bonilla, 
it has been shown that his hernia is of long-standing, and therefore, is <i>not 
of recent origin</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Although he felt some pains 
after the alleged-strain on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jan. 20, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<i>there is no showing that there was discoloration and evidence of tearing of 
the tissues</i> which would have necessitated an immediate operation. As to the 
alleged strain on February 5, 1961, no such discoloration or tearing of the 
tissue were likewise observed, but only his scrotum loosened (<span class="SpellE">lumalawit</span>) '<span class="SpellE">everytime</span> I tightened 
the independent chuck of the lathe I was operating,' a condition which is 
ordinary in reducible hernia of long-standing. He was finally operated for <span class="SpellE">herniorrhapy</span>, only after he has been continuously bothered 
or annoyed by the constant bulging of his scrotum <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> he tightened the independent chuck of the lathe. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span class="SpellE">Moorehead</span> stated that in Hernia, 'the protrusion is the 
final result of previous gradual alteration of the rings, fascia, and muscles. 
Its appearance may be "silent" or accompanied by mild distress. <i>But no 
unusual act or endeavor is necessary for its appearance</i>. It may show up with 
stooping, bending, or lifting at the shop but may just as likely appear while at 
stool at home." (Italics supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“In view of all the foregoing, it 
is our considered opinion that <i>the hernia and the nature of the work of 
Perfecto Bonilla have no causal relationship</i>; and that the eventual hernia 
operation was done not because it was aggravated as a result of the alleged 
strain in the course of his employment but because of the progressive 
enlargement during the long span of 10 years, of the pre-formed sac filled with 
intestine or <span class="SpellE">omentum</span> which kept on exerting gradual 
pressure upon the weakening abdominal rings, fascia and 
muscles."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the foregoing report we take 
note of the following statement: "It is our considered opinion that the 
<i>hernia and the nature of the work of Perfecto Bonilla have no causal 
relationship</i>; and that the eventual hernia operation was done not because it 
was aggravated as a result of the alleged strain in the course of his employment 
but because of the progressive enlargement during the long span of 10 years, of 
the pre-formed sac filled with intestine or <span class="SpellE">omentum</span> 
which kept on exerting gradual pressure upon the weakening abdominal rings, 
fascia and muscles." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is nothing in the record to 
disprove this finding which is based on a careful and serious study made by two 
doctors of the Workmen's Compensation Commission. This being a question of fact 
we have no other alternative than to abide by it. The authorities cited by 
claimant's counsel do not appear to involve facts similar to those obtaining in 
the present case. Hence, they are not controlling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed. No costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
