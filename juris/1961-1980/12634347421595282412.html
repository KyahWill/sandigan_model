for stealing goats, TV sets, dogs, and other articles with four feet; and that
the deceased was a fireman, holding a high rank in the <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, however, rejected the claim of the accused that
he killed Felipe de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court said:</p>

<blockquote>"To merit judicial confidence, plea of self-defense must be
proven by clear, convincing and satisfactory evidence to erase any doubt of
aggression on the part of the person defending himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Ramon, 77 Phil. 4; Jorge,
71 Phil. 451; Mendoza, 52 P.G. 6233; <span class="SpellE">Berio</span>, 59 Phil.
533; Cruz, 53 Phil. 635).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defense did not succeed in establishing the plea of
self-defense by clear and convincing evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is so because no less than the accused <span class="GramE">himself</span>
and his corroborative witness Oscar <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span> have
contradicted each other in a very material point and therefore their
testimonies are of doubtful probative value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Urminita</span> testifying in his <span class="GramE">behalf,</span>
stated that he fired only one (1) shot, whereas, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span>,
on the stand claimed that the accused fired two (2) shots at the direction of
the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So also the claim of the
accused that the victim was then carrying two (2) guns at the time of the
incident is not believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Urminita</span> claimed that the victim has a gun in his possession,
while the other one was placed in the motorcycle of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Common sense dictates that the victim would
not be so reckless as to place a loaded unlicensed gun in his motorcycle,
because the same could be easily detected by upon and could be picked up by
anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the testimony of the
accused that prior to the shooting incident, he was rained with fist blows by
the victim in the presence of so many people without any succor given him,
cannot be given much credence because both accused and victim are known in the
place and certainly they could have been pacified by the people around the
place.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the evidence on record, there exists a signed extra
judicial confession on the part of the accused (Exhibit 'E').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Settled is the rule that conviction will
suffice if an extra judicial confession is corroborated by the evidence of <u>corpus</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the records, the <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>
or fact of death is undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
extra judicial confession, accused admitted that he has planned to kill the
victim, because of information that the victim is after him for having
testified against the deceased in a certain case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an act of self-preservation, he armed
himself with a gun (Exhibit 'D') and waited for an opportune time, and that
when he saw <span style="">the </span>victim, he shot
him treacherously causing the latter's death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, during the trial of this case, testifying in his behalf,
accused made a sudden turn about claiming that he was maltreated and pressured
by Patrolman Ricardo Mendoza, Jr. into signing his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This vain attempt of <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
<span class="SpellE">Urminita</span> to evade criminal responsibility is hard to
believe for assuming that he was really maltreated by the police, it does not
necessary mean that what he will say is not the truth for it is highly probable
that it is the real truth (PP. vs. Miguel, 44 O.G. 2791).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, on the stand, he admitted that he
did not file any charges, be it administrative or criminal against his alleged
tormentors even up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
unnatural and uncommon attitude of the <span class="GramE">accused,</span>
therefore is not consistent with his vehement claim of the involuntariness of
his confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No proof was presented
to show any evil motive on the part of Patrolman Ricardo Mendoza, Jr., to
coerce the accused into admitting a crime that he did not commit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, regularity in the
performance of official duties is presumed and that we should give the benefit
of the doubt to the law enforcers involved that their actuations have been
motivated only by their desire to be true to their oaths of office as Peace Officers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another circumstance which is not consistent with the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> claim of innocence is his action of trying to
hide away from the authorities after the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not the common reaction of one who
has a clear conscience for as the saying goes 'the innocent is as brave or bold
as a lion, but the guilty <span class="SpellE">fleeth</span> even where no man <span class="SpellE">pursueth</span>.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

conviction;</blockquote>

the alleged extra-judicial confession of accused-appellant marked as Exhibit E

He quoted certain portions of the transcript of stenographic notes taken during

<p class="BODY">We have examined the entire records of the case, together with
portions of the transcript of stenographic notes quoted by the appellant, and
find no justification for the claim that the trial judge was partial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the appellant had magnified a
minor incident, wherein the trial judge sustained the objections of the fiscal
to the propriety of the questions asked, and considered the same as proof of a
conspiracy to deny his client his day in court, without taking into
consideration the fact that the action of the trial judge was within the
purview of the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the
accused had been given every opportunity to defend himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also find that the accused had not offered conclusive and
satisfactory proof that he killed Felipe de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes
in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial
court, the testimony of the accused and that of Oscar <span class="SpellE">Velardo</span>
are not worthy of credence for being contradictory and inconsistent with each
other and We find no reason or motive for not accepting the conclusion arrived
at by the trial court after considering the result and weight of the oral
evidence and other circumstances which the proceedings show.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the plea of self-defense lies only
if the injuries inflicted upon the victim by the defendant were preceded by an
unlawful aggression by the victim, which was not provoked and was repelled by
him in a reasonable manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records
of the case do not conclusively show that the accused had been unlawfully and
without cause assaulted by the deceased Felipe de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes before the latter was shot by him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, the record shows that the accused shot the deceased
Felipe de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes immediately upon seeing him.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant further
assails the trial court for giving credence to the testimony of Pat. Ricardo
Mendoza, Jr., whom he claims to be biased and one-sided, for testifying that he
does not know that the deceased Felipe de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes
had other cases pending against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The fact, however, that Pat.</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
did not know of other cases pending against the deceased <span class="GramE">which</span>,
incidentally, the accused did not bother to enumerate, is not proof of bias or
partiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a mere police
patrolman and not the custodian of police or court records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he may be a nodding acquaintance of the
deceased,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
he cannot be expected to know every facet of the man's life.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused also contends
that the evidence of the prosecution is insufficient to sustain a conviction
for murder because the extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"E") upon which the findings of treachery and evident premeditation
are based, was obtained from him by means of force; and that the accused was
not attended by counsel nor informed of his right to counsel, during the
custodial interrogation, and, therefore, the said extra-judicial confession is
inadmissible in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of maltreatment, however, was not corroborated and
the accused had not filed any case, whether administrative, criminal, or civil,
against those persons who had<span style=""> </span>allegedly
maltreated him and forced him to sign the "<span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>"
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "E").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the accused admitted having affixed his signature to
the <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>" and affirmed the veracity of
certain statements contained therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the said statement or admissions were given by him soon after the
incident happened, leaving no opportunity for the police investigators or
anyone else to concoct a story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that his "<span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"E") was not subscribed and sworn to <span class="GramE">is</span> not
an indication that the said "<span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>" was
involuntary, for if, indeed, he had been forced to sign the confession, in all
probability, he would have been also forced or further coerced to affirm his
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, since nothing happened
to the accused after he refused to confirm his "<span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>",
his claim cannot be sustained.<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the accused was not assisted by counsel of <span style="">his </span>choice during the custodial investigation,
as required under Article IV, Section 20 of the Constitution, does not render
the extra-judicial confession executed by him, previous to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the new Constitution, inadmissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Magtoto</u></span><u>

the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"We hold that this specific portion of this constitutional
mandate has and should be given a prospective and not a retrospective
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, a confession
obtained from a person under investigation for the commission of an offense,
who has not been informed of his right (to silence and) to counsel, is
inadmissible in evidence if the same had been obtained after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Constitution on January 17,
1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, such confession is
admissible in evidence against the accused, if the same had been obtained
before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Constitution, even
if presented after <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>,
and even if he had not been informed of his right to counsel, since no law gave
the accused the right to be so informed before that date."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly found the accused <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
<span class="SpellE">Urminita</span> y de Leon guilty of the crime of Murder,
qualified by treachery and attended by the generic aggravating circumstance of
evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the
attack was frontal, yet it was made suddenly and unexpectedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, therefore, employed a means in
the execution of the crime that insured its execution without risk to <span class="GramE">himself</span> arising from the defense which the offended party
might make.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Court erred in
imposing the death penalty upon the said accused in view of the presence of the
