Aurelio G. <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> filed an action in the Municipal
Court of Manila against <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>, Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> and <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>, to
recover from them, jointly and severally, the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
plus damages, attorney's fees and costs of suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants answered the complaint with
specific denials and the following special defenses and compulsory

<p class="BODY">Defendants allege:</p>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants executed the real estate mortgage,
Annex 'A' of the complaint, as security for the loan of P1<span class="GramE">,200.00</span>
given to defendant <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span>
upon the usu­rious agreement that defendant pays to the plaintiff and that the
plaintiff reserve and secure, as in fact plain­tiff reserved and secured to
himself, out of the alleged loan of P1,500.00 as interest the sum of P300.00
for one year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That although the mortgage contract, Annex 'A'
was executed for securing the payment of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> for
a period of one year, without interest, the truth and the real fact is that
plaintiff delivered to the defendant <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span> only the sum of P1,200.00 and withheld the sum of
P300.00 which was intended as advance interest for one year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on account of said loan of P1<span class="GramE">,200.00</span>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span> paid to the plaintiff during the period from October
1955 to July 1956 the total sum of P330.00 which plaintiff, illegally and
unlawfully refuse to acknowledge as part payment of the account but as in
interest of the said loan for an exten­sion of another term of one year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That said contract of loan entered into
between plaintiff and defendant <span class="SpellE">Pri­mitivo</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Cammayo</span> is a usurious contract and is contrary to law,
morals, good cus­toms, public order or public policy and is, therefore,
inexistent and void from the beginning (Art 1407 Civil Code);</blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendants <span class="SpellE">replead</span> all their allegations
in the preceding paragraphs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff, by taking and re­ceiving
interest in excess of that allowed by law, with full intention to violate the
law, at the expense of the defendants, com­mitted a flagrant violation of Act
2655, otherwise known as the Usury Law, causing the defendants damages and
attorney's fees, the amount of which will be proven at the trial;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this is the second time this same case is
filed before this court, the first having been previously filed and docketed in
this court as Civil Case No. 75845 (Branch VII) and the same was dismissed by
the Court of First Instance of Manila on July 13, 1961 in Civil Case No. 43121
(Branch XVII) and for repeatedly bringing this case to the court, harassing and
persecut­ing defendants in that manner, defendants have suffered mental anguish
and anxiety for which they should be com­pensated for moral damages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="9">September 7<i>, </i>1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Briones</span> filed an unverified reply in which he merely
denied the allegations of the counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon the defendants moved for the rendition of a summary judgment
on the ground that, upon the record, there was no genuine issue of fact between
the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Municipal Court granted
the motion and rendered judgment sentencing the defendants to pay the plaintiff
the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> with interests thereon at the
legal rate from <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1962</st1:date>,
plus the sum of P150.00 as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this judgment, the defendants appealed to the Court of First
Instance of Manila where, according to the appealed decision, "de­fendant
has asked for summary judgment and plaintiff has agreed to the same." <span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal p. 21).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having found the motion for summary judgment to be in order, the court
then proceeded to render judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Judgment is, therefore, rendered, ordering Defendant to pay
Plaintiff the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,180.00</span> with interest thereon
at the legal rate from <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="10">October 16,
 1962</st1:date> until fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
judgment repre­sents Defendant's debt of P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
less usurious interest of P120.00 and the ad­ditional sum of P200.00 as
attorney's fees or a total deduction of P320.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff shall pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal defendants claim that the trial court erred
in sentencing them to pay the princi­pal of the loan notwithstanding its
finding that the same was tainted with usury, and erred likewise in not
dismissing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not now disputed that the contract of loan in question was
tainted with usury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only questions
to be resolved, therefore, are firstly, whether the creditor is entitled to
collect from the debtor the amount representing the principal obligation;
secondly, in the affirmative, if he is entitled to collect inter­ests thereon,
and if so, at what rate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Usury Law penalizes any person or corporation who, for any
loan or renewal thereof or forbearance, shall collect or receive a higher rate
or greater sum or value than is allowed by law, and provides further that, in
such case, the debtor may recover the whole interest, commission, premiums,
penalties and surcharges paid or delivered, with costs and attorney's fees, in
an appropriate action against his creditor, within two (2) years after such
payment or delivery (Section 6, Act 2655, as amended by Acts 3291 and 3998).</p>

<p class="BODY">Construing the above provision, <span class="GramE">We</span> held
in Go <span class="SpellE">Chioco</span> vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>,
45 Phil. 256 that even if the contract of loan is declared usurious the
creditor is entitled to col­lect the money actually loaned and the legal
interest due thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Gui</span> <span class="SpellE">Jong</span>
&amp; Co. vs. Rivera, et al., 45 Phil. 778, this Court likewise declared that,
in any event, the debtor in a usurious contract of loan should pay the cred­itor
the amount which he justly owes him, citing in support of this ruling its
previous decisions in Go <span class="SpellE">Chioco</span> Supra, Aguilar vs. <span class="SpellE">Rubiato</span>, et al., 40 Phil. 570, and Delgado vs. <span class="SpellE">Duque</span> <span class="SpellE">Valgona</span>, 44 Phil, 739.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all the above cited cases it was recognized and held that
under Act 2655 a usurious contract is void; that the creditor had no right of
action to recover the inter­est in excess of the lawful rate; but that this did
not mean that the, debtor may keep the principal received by him as loan – thus
unjustly enriching himself to the damage of the creditor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then in Lopez and <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span> vs. El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino, 47 Phil. 249, We also held that the
standing jurisprudence of this Court on the question under consideration was
clearly to the effect that the Usury Law, by its letter and spirit, did not
deprive the lender of his right to recover from the borrower the money actually
loaned to and enjoyed by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court went further to say that the Usury Law did not provide for
the forfeiture of the capital in favor of the debtor in usurious contracts, and
that while the forfeiture might appear to be convenient as a drastic measure to
eradicate the evil of <span class="GramE">usury,</span> the legal question
involved should not be resolved on the basis of convenience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other cases upholding the same principle are <span class="SpellE">Palileo</span>
vs. Casio, 97 Phil. 919 and <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> vs. Perez, G.R.
No. L-19554, <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1964</st1:date>,
10 SCRA 199, 200-202.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter <span class="GramE">We</span> expressly held that when a contract is found to be
tainted with usury "the only right of the respondent (creditor) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> was merely to collect the amount of the loan, plus
interest due thereon."</p>

<p class="BODY">The view has been expressed, however, that the ruling thus
consistently adhered to should now be abandoned because Article 1957 of the new
Civil Code - a subsequent law - provides that contracts and stipula­tions, under
any cloak or device whatever, intended to circumvent the laws against usury,
shall be void, and that in such cases "the borrower may recover in
accordance with the laws on usury." From this the conclusion is drawn that
the <u>whole</u> contract is void and that, therefore, the creditor has no
right to recover - not even his capital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The meaning and scope of our ruling in the cases mentioned
heretofore is clearly stated, and the view re­ferred to in the preceding
paragraph is adequately answered in Angel Jose, etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Chelda</span>
Enterprises, et al. (G.R. No. L-25704, <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="4">April
 24, 1968</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question
of whether a creditor in a usurious contract may or may not recover the
principal of the loan, and, in the affirmative, whether or not he may also
recover interest thereon at the legal rate, <span class="GramE">We</span> said
the following:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The court found that there remained due
from defendants an unpaid principal amount of P20<span class="GramE">,287.50</span>;
that plaintiff charged usurious interests, of which P1,048.15 had actually been
deducted in advance by plaintiff from the loan; that said amount of P1,048.15
should therefore be deducted from the unpaid princi­pal of P20,287.50 leaving a
balance of P19,247.35 still payable to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court held that notwithstanding the usu­rious
interests charged, plaintiff, is not barred from collecting the principal of
the loan or its balance of P19<span class="GramE">,247.35</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it stated in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision, thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering the
defendant partnership to pay to the plaintiff the amount of P19<span class="GramE">,247.35</span>, with legal interest thereon from May 29, 1964 until
paid, plus an additional sum of P2,000.00 as damages for attorney's fee; and,
in case the assets of defendant partnership be insufficient to satisfy this
judgment in full, ordering the defendant David <span class="SpellE">Syjueco</span>
to pay to the plaintiff one-half (1/2) of the unsatisfied portion of this
judgment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"With costs against the defendants."</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appealing directly to <span class="GramE">Us</span>, defendants raise
two questions of law:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) In a loan with
usu­rious interest, may the creditor recover the principal of the loan?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) Should attorney's fees be awarded in
plaintiff's favor?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Great reliance is made by appellants on Art. 1411 of the New
Civil Code which states:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 1411.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
nullity proceeds from the illegality of the cause or object of the contract,
and the act constitutes a crimi­nal offense, both parties being in <span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span>, they shall have no
action against each other, and both shall be prosecuted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the provisions of the Penal Code relative
to the disposal of effects or instruments of a crime shall be applicable to the
things or the price of the contract."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This rule shall be applicable when only one of the parties is
guilty; but the innocent one may claim what he has given, and shall not be
bound to comply with his promise."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since, according to the appellants, a
usurious loan is void due to illegality of cause or object, the rule of <span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span> expressed in Article
1411, supra, applies, so that neither party can bring action against each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said rule, however, appellants
add, is modified as to the borrower, by express provision of the law (Art.
1413, New Civil Code), allowing the borrower to recover interest paid in excess
of the interest allowed by the Usury Law. As to the lender, no exception is
made to the rule; hence, he cannot recover on the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So - they continue - the New Civil Code
provisions must be upheld as against the Usury Law, under which a loan with
usurious interest is not totally void, because of Article 1961 of the New Civil
Code, that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Usurious contracts
shall be governed by the Usury Law and other special laws, so far as they are
not incon­sistent with this Code." <span class="GramE">(Italics ours.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>We do not agree with such reasoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1411 of the New Civil Code is not
new; it is the same as Article 1305 of the Old Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, said provision is no warrant for
de­parting from previous interpretation that, as provided in the Usury Law (Act
No. 2655, as amended), a loan with usurious interest is not totally void only
as to the interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>True, as stated in Article 1411 of the New Civil Code, the rule of <span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span> applies where a
contract's nullity proceeds from il­legality of the cause or object of said
contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, appellants fail to consider that a contract of loan with
usurious interest consists of principal and accessory stipulations; the
principal one is to pay the debt; the accessory stipulation is to pay interest
thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And said two stipulations are divisible in the sense that the
former can still stand without the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 1273, Civil Code, attests to this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The renuncia­tion of the principal debt
shall extinguish the accessory obligations; but the waiver of the latter shall
leave the former in force."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The question therefore to resolve is whether the illegal terms as
to payment of interest likewise renders a nullity the legal terms as to
payments of the principal debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
1420 of the New Civil Code provides in this regard:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In case of a di­visible contract, if
the illegal terms can be separated from the legal ones, the latter may be
enforced."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">In simple loan with stipulation of usurious
interest, the <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> of the debtor to pay the
principal debt, which is the cause of the contract (Article 1350, Civil Code),
is not illegal.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The illegality
lies only as to the <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> to pay the stipulated
interest; hence, being separable, the latter only should be deemed void, since
it is the only one that is illegal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Neither is there a conflict between the New Civil Code and the
Usury Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the latter, in Sec. 6,
any person who for a loan shall have paid a higher rate or greater sum or value
than is allowed in said <span class="GramE">law,</span> may re­cover the whole
interest paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The New Civil Code, in
Article 1413 states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Interest paid
in excess of the interest allowed by the usury laws may be recovered by the
debtor, with in­terest thereon from the date of payment." Article 1413, in
speaking of "interest paid in excess of the interest allowed by the usury
laws" means the whole usurious interest; that is, in a loan of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>, with interest of 20% per annum or P200 for one year,
if the bor­rower pays said P200, the whole P200 is the usurious interest, not
just that part thereof in excess of the interest allowed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this case that the law does not
allow division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole stipulation as
to inter­est is void, since payment of said interest is illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only change effected, therefore, by
Article 1413, New Civil Code, is not to provide for the recovery of the
interest paid in excess of that allowed by law, which the Usury Law al­ready
provided for, but to add that the same can be recovered "with interest
thereon from the date of payment."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The foregoing interpretation is reached with the philosophy of
usury legislation in mind; to discourage stipulations on usurious <span class="GramE">interest,</span> said stipulations are treated as wholly void, so
that the loan becomes one without stipulation as to payment of interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not, how­ever, be interpreted to
mean forfeiture even of the principal, for this would un­justly enrich the
borrower at the expense of the lender.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, penal sanc­tions are available against a usurious lender,
as a further deterrence to usury.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The principal debt remaining without stipulation for payment of
interest can thus be recovered by judicial action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in case of such demand, and the debtor
incurs in delay, the debt earns interest from the date of the demand (in this
case from the filing of the complaint).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such interest is not due to stipulation, for there was none, the same
being void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it is due to the
general provision of law that in obligations to pay money, where the debtor
incurs in delay, he has to pay interest by way of damages (Art. 2209, Civil
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court a quo there­fore, did
not err in ordering defendants to pay the principal debt with interest thereon
at the legal rate, from the date of filing of the complaint."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In answer to the contention that the forfeiture of the principal
of the usurious loan is necessary to punish the usurer, We say this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Usury Law there is already
provision for adequate punishment for the usurer, namely, criminal prosecution
where if convicted, he may be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than P50 nor
more than P500, or imprisonment of not less than 30 days nor more than one
year, or both, in the discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He may further be sentenced to return the entire sum received as
interest, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of non–payment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, of course, to be assumed that this
last penalty may be imposed only if the return of the entire sum received as
interest had mot yet been the subject of judgment in a civil action involving
the usurious contract of loan.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at the above conclusion <span class="GramE">We</span>
also con­sidered our decision in <span class="SpellE">Mulet</span> vs. The People
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(73 Phil. p. 60), but found that the same does not apply to the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts therein involved were as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1929" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1929</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubillos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Espectacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Rubillos</span> secured from
peti­tioner Miguel <span class="SpellE">Mulet</span> a loan of P550, payable
within 5 years at 30 per cent interest per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the deed of mortgage executed by the <span class="SpellE">Rubillos</span> as a security, the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,375</span>
was made to appear as the capital of the loan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This amount obviously represented the actual loan of P550 and the total
inter­est of P825 computed at 30 per cent per annum for 5 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within four years following the execution of
the mortgage, the debtors made partial payments aggregating P278.27, on account
of interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the debtors
paid the whole capital of P550, due to peti­tioners promise to condone the
unpaid in­terest upon payment of such capital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But to their surprise, petitioner informed them that they were still
indebted in the sum of P546.73 which represented the balance of the usurious interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in consideration of this amount,
petitioner pressed upon the debtors to execute in October, 1933, in his favor,
a deed of sale with <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro of a parcel of
land, in substitution of the original mortgage which was cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the date of the execution of the new
deed up to 1936, petitioner received, as his share of the products of the land,
the total sum of P480.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecuted on <st1:date year="1936" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1936</st1:date>, for the violation
of the Usury Law, peti­tioner was convicted by the trial court, and on appeal,
the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
directed at that portion of the decision of the appellate court ordering peti­tioner
to return to the offended parties the sum of P373.27, representing interests re­ceived
by him in excess of that allowed by law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was <span class="SpellE">Mulet's</span> claim that, as the
amount of P373.27 had been paid more than two years prior to the filing of the
complaint for usury against him, its return could no longer be ordered in
accordance with the prescriptive period provided <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
in Section 6 of the Usury Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
amount was made up of the usurious interest amount­ing to P278.27 paid to <span class="SpellE">Mulet</span>, in cash, and the sum of P480.00 paid to him in kind,
from the total of which two amounts 14% interest allowed by law – amounting to
P385,00 - was deducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our decision was
that <span class="SpellE">Mulet</span> should return the amount of P480.00 which
represented the value of the produce of the land sold to him under <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u> which, with the unpaid
balance of the usurious interest, was the consideration of the transaction –
meaning the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de</u> <u>retro</u>
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court then said:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This last amount is not usurious interest on
the capital of the loan but the value of the produce of the land sold to
petitioner under <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>,
with the unpaid balance of the usurious interest (P546.73) as the consideration
of the trans­action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This
consideration, because contrary to law, is illicit, and the contract which
results <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, null and void.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1275, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, under the provisions of article 1305, in
connection with article 1303, of the Civil Code, when the nullity of a contract
arises from the illegality of the consideration which in itself constitutes a
felony, the guilty party shall be subject to criminal proceed­ing while <u>the
innocent party may recover whatever he has given, including the fruits thereof</u>."
(<span class="GramE">underlines</span> supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that in the <span class="SpellE">Mulet</span>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that this decision expresses the fair and just intent
of our usury laws and sufficiently effectuates the public policy that should be
pursued in usury cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">I consider usury to be unchristian and inhuman, particularly
because it thrives best in the misery of people by taking advantage of them
when they are pre­cisely in urgent need of money to save themselves from a
tight situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usury has always been
consi­dered as a scourge everywhere in the world since the time of the Holy
Scriptures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these notwithstand­ing,
I do not believe in condoning the whole indebted­ness of a person who borrows
money, only because he has been made to agree, directly or indirectly, to pay
more interest than that authorized by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is my considered view that what the law proscribes and declares null
and void is not the lending of money, but only the collection of excessive
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing morally wrong
in allowing a money-lender to get back the money he has loaned because, after
all, the borrower has used the same for his own needs, and it is only fair that
he should not be enriched at the expense of another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, to my mind, is obvious from the
language of Article 1957 of the Civil Code which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"Contracts and stipulations, un­der any cloak or device
whatever, intended to circumvent the laws against usury shall be void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The borrower may recover in accordance with
the laws on usury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(n)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Properly construed, the phrase "contracts and
stipulations" in this provision does not contemplate the totality of the
contract of loan but only the por­tion thereof that is "intended to
circumvent the laws against usury", and that necessarily is no more than
any term, "cloack or device" which results in the col­lection of
interest in excess of the rate allowed by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, the same provision expressly provides that inspite of the
nullity it ordains, "the borrower may recover in accordance with the laws
or usury." In other words, instead of leaving the consequences of the
declared nullity to be in accordance with general principles, the article
itself spells out in black and white what should be done with the proceeds of
the proscribed act, and it says that the special laws on usury shall be
followed in that respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the same effect is Article 1961 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"Usurious contracts shall be governed by the Usury Law and
other special laws, so far as they are not inconsistent with this Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(n)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And I see no point of collision between
the Civil Code and the Usury Law for the simple reason that even before Art.
1957 declared usurious contracts and transactions null and void, section 7 of
the Usury Law already provided thus:</p>

<blockquote>"All covenants and stipulations contained in conveyances,
mortga­ges, bonds, bills, notes, and other contracts or evidences of debts, and
all deposits of goods or other things, whereupon or whereby there shall be <u>stipulated</u>,
<u>charged</u>, <u>demanded</u>, reserved, se­cured, taken, or received, direct­ly
or indirectly, a higher rate or greater sum or value for the loan or renewal
thereof or forbearance of money, goods, or credits than is hereinbefore
allowed, shall be void:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided,
however, That no merely clerical error in the computation of interest, made
without intend to evade any of the provisions of this Act, shall render a
contract void:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And provided, further,
That no­thing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the purchase by an
innocent purchaser of a negotiable mercantile pa­per, usurious or otherwise,
for valuable consideration before maturity, when there has been no intent on
the part of said purchaser to evade the provi­sions of this Act and said pur­chase
was not a part of the ori­ginal usurious transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, however, the maker of said note
shall have the right to recover from said original holder the whole interest
paid by him thereon and, in case of litigation, also the costs and such
attorney's fees as may be allowed by the court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it is to be noted that Sec­tion 6 of the
Usury Law provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Any person or corporation who, for any such loan or renewal
thereof or forbearance, shall have paid or delivered a higher rate or greater
sum or value than is hereinbefore allowed to be ta­ken or received, may recover
the whole interest, commissions, premiums <u>penalties and surcharges</u> paid
or delivered with costs and attorney's fees in such sum as may be allowed by
the court in an action against the person or corporation who took or received <u>them</u>
if such action is brought within two years after such payment or delivery:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That the creditor shall
not be obliged to return the interest, commis­sions <u>and premiums</u> for a
period of not more than one year collected by him in advance when the debtor
shall have paid the obligation before it is due, provided such interest, and
commissions and premiums do not exceed the rates fixed in this Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, then, even as the Civil Code yields to the
Usury Law in Articles 1967 and 1413, in reality there is no conflict between
their correspond­ing provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say
that because these laws specify only the remedies in favor of the borrower,
they im­pliedly deny to the lender any remedy to recover the principal of the
loan is, I submit, a <u>non</u> <u>sequitur</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears to me more logical to construe the
provisions allowing the borrower to recover all the interest he has paid, as
Article 1413 of the Civil Code and Section 6 of the Usury Law have been
construed together to mean in Angel Jose v. Chelda Enterprises, cited in the
main opinion, as indicating that the borrower may not reco­ver from the lender
the amount he has paid as payment of his principal debt, and conversely, that
the lender may collect the same if it has not been paid by the borrower.</p>

<p class="BODY">In brief, my point is that while it is true that Article 1957 of
the Civil Code declares that all usur­ious contracts and stipulations are void,
this is not­hing new, for such has been the law even under the Usury Law before
the Civil Code went into effect, and, moreover, it is evident that the Civil
Code itself yields to the Usury Law when it comes to the question of how much
of the loan and interests paid by the borrower may be recovered by him, and the
Usury Law is clear that he may recover only all the interests, in­cluding, of
course, the legal part thereof, with le­gal interest from the date of judicial
demand, without maintaining that he can also recover the principal he has
already paid to the lender.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Beyond the area of debate is the principle that in a contract of
loan of a sum of money, the cause, with respect to the lender, is generally the
borrower's prestation to return the same amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my view, however, that in a contract
which is tainted with usury, that is, with a stipulation (whether written<i> </i>or
unwritten) to pay usurious interest, the prestation to pay such interest is an
integral part of the cause of the contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is also the controlling cause, for a usurer lends his money not just to have
it returned but indeed to acquire inordinate gain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1957, which is a new provision in the
Civil Code, provides as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Contracts and stipulations, under any cloak or device whatever,
intended to circumvent the laws against usury shall be void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The borrower may recover in accordance with
the laws on usury." This article which declares the contract itself - not
merely the stipulation to pay usurious interest - void, necessarily regards the
prestation to pay such usurious interest as an integral part of the cause,
making it illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, the motive of the usurer is his desire to acquire
inordinate gain; this motive becomes an integral and controlling part of the
cause because its realization can be achieved only by compliance by the
borrower with the stipulated prestation to pay usurious interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law never proscribes a contract merely because of the immoral
motive of a contracting party, for the reason that it does not concern itself
with motive but only with cause.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
An exception is where such motive becomes an integral part of the cause, like
the stipulated usurious interest in a contract of loan.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the old law, according to <u>El Hogar</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
considered the usurious loan valid as to the loan and void as to the usurious
interest, the new law, in article 1957 of the new Civil Code, declares the
usurious loan void as to the loan and void as to the usurious interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is the reason for the new law?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is none other than its
intention to regard the usurious interest as an integral part of the cause,
thus making it illegal; otherwise, the new law would be devoid of reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any interpretation that divests the new law
of reason, that declares the usurious contract void and in the same breath
permits recovery of the principal of the loan - which was the same result under
the old law, as well as under <u>El Hogar</u> that considered the usurious
contract valid as to the loan - renders article 1957 of the new Civil Code meaningless
and pointless.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prestation to pay usurious interest being an integral and
controlling part of the cause, making it illegal and the con­tract of loan
void, article 1411 of the new Civil Code should be applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This article provides:</p>

<blockquote>"When the nullity proceeds from the ille­gality of the cause
or object of the contract, and the act constitutes a criminal offense, both
parties being in <u>pari</u> <u>delicto</u>, they shall have no action against
each other, and both shall be prosecuted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the provisions of the Penal Code rela­tive to the disposal of
effects or instruments of a crime shall be applicable to the things or the
price of the contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This rule shall be applicable when only one of the parties is
guilty; but the innocent one may claim what he has given, and shall not be
bound to comply with his promise."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An exception is, however, provided in the second sentence of
article 1957 which states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>''The
borrower may recover in accordance with the laws on usury." As an
exception to the general rule in article 1411, the debtor is allowed in
accordance with the Usury Law to recover the amount he has paid as usurious
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, article 1413 explicitly
authorizes that "Interest paid in excess of the interest allowed by the
usury laws may be recovered by the debtor, with interest thereon from the date
of payment." But the lender is not allowed to recover the principal,
because no such exception is made; hence, he falls within the general rule
stated in article 1411.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Mulet vs. People,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the Supreme Court, in effect, recon­sidered its opinion in <u>El Hogar</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Mulet</u>, the plaintiff extended a
usurious loan to Rebillos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
debtor failed to pay the whole usurious interest, the creditor, in
consideration of the said unpaid interests, made the debtor execute a <u>pacto
de retro</u> sale of certain properties to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then sought to be exempt from returning the value of the produce of
the lands so transferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice
Moran, speaking for the Supreme Court, said:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * We are of the opinion that the peti­tioner should be
ordered to return * * * the amount * * * of P480.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This last amount is not usurious interest on
the capital of the loan but the value of the produce of the land sold to
petitioner under <u>pacto de retro</u>, with the unpaid balance of the usurious
interest as the considera­tion of the transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This consideration, because contrary to law,
is illicit, and the contract which results therefrom, null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the unpaid usurious interests as the con­sideration of the
<u>pacto de retro</u> sale render such sale null and void, <u>a</u> <u>fortiori</u>,
the usurious inte­rest as consideration of the contract of loan, also renders
such loan null and void."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Asturias</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
et al. vs. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Jesus Barrera, stressed
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A contract designed to hide
a usurious agreement not only violates the law but contravenes public
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a contract can not be
countenanced and is therefore illegal and void from its inception."</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in <u>El Hogar</u> that a usurious loan was valid as
to the principal but void as to the usurious interest was based upon the laws
then in force, namely, the old Civil Code and the Usury Law, both of which did
not contain any specific explicit provision proscribing the contract itself. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I am fully persuaded that in drafting Chapter
2, Title XI of Book IV of the new Civil Code, the Code Commission knew of the
majority opinion in El Hogar, took note of it, and, to offset any doubt
concerning the intention of the Commission to overrule <u>El Hogar</u>,
formulated articles 1957 and 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
it is of great significance to me that when the Commission formulates article
1957, knowing that under <u>El Hogar</u> the usurer may recover the principal
of the loan, it omitted affirmance of the right of the lender to recover the
principal, and instead emphasized that "the borrower may recover in
accordance with the laws on usury."</p>
