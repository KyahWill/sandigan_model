				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Appeal from a decision of
the Court of Juve­nile and Domestic Relations dismissing the petition </span>of
Virginia <span class="SpellE">Basas</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
hereinafter referred to as appellant - for a change of names of the minors
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Gui</span>, Alberto <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Basas</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Basas</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> and Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Basas</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
her petition, appellant alleges that said minors are he</span><span style="">r </span><span style="">children, born out
of wedlock, on August 23, 1953, </span><span style="">July
4, 1956, De­cember 17, 1958 and May 22, 1960, respectively; that, although the <span class="SpellE">the</span> children had been registered, in the Office of the
Local Civil Registrar of Manila, under the names aforementioned, they were
baptized as Antonio Chua, Jr., Alberto Chua, Jose Ernesto Chua y <span class="SpellE">Basas</span>, and Evelyn Chua, respectively; and that these discrep­ancies,
between their names as registered in the aforementioned office and as entered
in the records of the parish churches in which they were, respectively,
baptized, are "very confusing and may mislead the people and the
authorities of their true identities." Appellant prayed, therefore, that
the names of said <span style="">minors </span>be
changed to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Basas</span>, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Basas</span>,
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Basas</span> and Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Basas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due publication of
the corresponding notice and hear­ing, the aforementioned </span><span style="">Court rendered</span><span style=""> the appealed decision, dis­missing appellant's petition, for the
following reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In <u>this proceeding, petitioners have asked that they be
authorized to change their surnames to <span class="SpellE">Basas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have alleged that they were born out of
wedlock, since their father was married to a woman in </u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u>China</u></st1:place></st1:country-region><u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being Illegitimate <span class="SpellE">offsprings</span>,
they claim to be entitled to use their mother's surname under the </u><u><span style="">provision of Article 368 of the Civil </span>Code</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners further claimed that although in
their birth certificates they carry the surname <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Gui</span> for Antonio and <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> for the
other petitioner, all <u>of them have however been listed</u> in <u>their
baptismal certificates with the surname Chua.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their mother stated that this has led to confusion as to the identi<span style="">ties </span>of the minors</u> especially when
enrolling them in school as sometimes the submission of the birth certificates
are required and at other times it is their baptismal certificates that are <span style="">required<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"xx<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">xx</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>This Court has previously ruled that aliens cannot avail
themselves of Rule 103</u> (Sp. Proc. No. 03252 <span class="SpellE">Sim</span>
Chi Tat, Petitioner), <u>and that it will not entertain a petition for a change
of name when peti</u><u><span style="">tioner<span style="">'s</span> citizenship <span style="">is </span>either <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> <span style="">or doubt</span>­<span style="">ful</span></span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">(Sp. Proc. No. 02915,
Chua <span class="SpellE">Mah</span> Tuan Petitioner).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a recent case (Lim v. de la Rosa L-17790,
March 31, 1964), a statement made by the trial court <span style="">in a change of name proceedings</span> to<span style=""> </span>the effect that petitioner was a Filipino was deemed by the
Supreme Court to be an indication that petitioner was in­deed a Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling confirms the advis­ability of this
court's denying a change of name where a petitioner's claim of Filipino
citizenship is open to doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice
J.B.L. Reyes, in Board vs. Domingo, G.R. No. L-21274, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7"><span style="">July 31,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, has said:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It is highly desirable that courts should at all times be keenly
aware that certain aliens are apt to resort to despe­rate means in order to
obtain the benefits of Filipino citizenship, and that they should ever endeavor
to bar the possibil­ity that judicial proceedings should be utilized to
circumvent the policy of our Constitution and statutes, even tempora­rily.'</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"In the case at bar,
the children involved would be Chinese citizens if they are natural chil­dren,
or if their parents are legally married.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>The Court has grave doubts in respect of the allegation made in their
behalf that they are illegitimate</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of late, there has been a trend or claims of illegiti­macy being made by
children of Chinese fathers and Filipino mothers with the obvious aim of ob­taining
judicial recognition, however, indirect, that they are entitled to be
considered Filipino citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
has refused to give due course to petitions based on such claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the following statements, among others,
have been made:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
The Chinese community, </span>within the last few years, has realized that
there is an advantage in alleging that Chinese nationals are not married to
their Filipino wives, to enable their children to claim Philippine citizenship
without going through naturalization proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Often-times <span style="">the non-</span><span style="">marriage, or illegitimate</span><span style=""> </span>status of the children, is sought to
be established indirectly through petitions for change of surnames.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many instances have already come before this
Court.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Take the case of petitioner’s mo­ther.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that her reason for in­stituting
this proceeding is so that '"as long as I am still alive I want his papers
to be complete.'" Although the statement can be limited to mean only
papers re­lative to the surname being used, it "'strikes the Court as an
unguarded ad­mission that what is here substantially sought is the
establishment of the <span style="">al­leged </span>Philippine
citizenship of petitioner in addition to legalization of the use of the
mother's surname., (Sp. Proc. No. 04022, Ernesto Ng, Petitioner).</p>

<p class="2Q">'If it be a fact indeed that <span style="">petitioners
</span>are illegitimate children of their parents, the petition filed herein
should be granted pursuant to the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Ing</span> King vs. Rep., G. R. No. L-8301, April 28, 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>However, unlike the situation in that
case, the claimed <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> in this proceeding has
not</u> been <u>proven to the satisfaction of the Court</u>.</p>

<p class="2Q">'<u>The mere statement of the mother that they were not married to
each other does not completely convince the Court that the allegation is true</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although negative in nature, the allegation <span style="">of non-marriage </span>is es­sential to the
establishment of the <span style="">illegitimate
relationship </span>and substantial corroborating evidence <span style="">is </span>required by the Court to dispute
the presumption that a man and a wife deporting themselves as husband and wife
are legal­ly married (Cu v. <span style="">Rep., </span>89
Phil. 473).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­<span style="">tioner </span>minors were born in 1955, 1957 and 1960, which are periods
after it has general­ly been realized that there is<span style=""> an </span>advantage in <span style="">alleging that Chinese nationals are not
married to their Filipino wives, thus enabling their children to claim
Philippine citizen­ship without naturalization proceedings. Many claims of that
nature have already come before this court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'If Tan Kun were single at the time the petitioners were conceived,
they would have the status of recognized natural chil­dren of their parents and
would have to bear their father's surname (Art. 266, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To controvert that possibility, the mother,
but not the father, has testified that the latter has a wife in China.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That bare statement does not constitute
satisfactory proof of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
allegation that a Chinese national resident in our country has a wife in China
is already a trite one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, it
was invoked and in effect rejected in 1910 in <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Joc</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lieng</span></span><span style=""> </span>v. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quia</span></span><span style="">, </span>et
al., 16 Phil. 137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may meet success
where officials are with actual or mercenary <span class="SpellE">naivete</span>,
but courts have to re­ject the proposition unless substantiated by strong
evidence.' (Sp. Proc. No. D-00089, <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> Tan, et
al., Petitioners).</p>

<blockquote>"Lastly, the court believes that its discretion should be
exercised against the instant petition for the reason that it appears that the
minors involved herein<span style=""> have been
baptized under a different family name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It can be presumed that Chinese children from abroad have been brought,
and are being brought, into this country, either openly or surreptitiously, to
assume the identity of children locally born.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In most </span>in­<span style="">stances,
discrepancies are bound to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court would not like to confirm that a child born un­der one name with an
indicated father, and a child baptized with another name, and with another indi­cated
father, is one and the same person, for the court might unwittingly give
practical legality to a </span><span style="">substitution
of identity."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering </span><span style="">that appellant's petition is based upon the </span>pre­mise
<span style="">that the persons recorded in the Office
of the Local Civil </span>Re<span style="">gistrar of
Manila as Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Gui</span>,
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Basas</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ernet</span><span style="">o</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Basas</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> and

the very same persons </span><span style="">baptized
as </span><span style="">Antonio Chua, Jr., Alberto
Chua, Jose Ernesto Chua <span class="SpellE">Basas</span></span><span style=""> </span>an <span style="">Evelyn Chua, respectively; that the main evidence on the of the persons
to whom </span><span style="">these two </span><span style="">(2) sets of
names </span><span style="">correspond is </span><span style="">appellant's own testimony, which the trial
Judge<span style="">&nbsp; </span><sup>_</sup> who, </span><span style="">having observed </span><span style="">appellant's demeanor during the trial, was in
</span><span style="">a far better <span style="">position than we are, to gauge her
truthfulness </span></span><span style="">found it </span><span style="">hardly </span><span style="">convincing; that it has </span><span style="">not been satisfactorily explained </span><span style="">why t</span><span style="">he </span><span style="">aforementioned minors were allegedly baptized with </span><span style="">a surname </span><span style="">dif<span style="">ferent from that appearing
in their respective birth certificates, </span></span><span style="">well as from that of their alleged mother and alleged father; </span><span style="">that the </span><span style="">relief prayed for by appellant herein is predicated upon an allegation </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">fact </span><span style="">which cannot be determined without </span><span style="">passing upon the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">filiation</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of said minors, in relation to a man who is
not a party in this </span><span style="">pro<span style="">ceedings, without inquiring into the question
</span></span><span style="">whether he is </span><span style="">guilty or</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">not of <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>, and without affecting, not only their civil status,
but, also, their nationality; and that the question whether or not</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">change of name should be authorized is primarily addressed </span><span style="">t </span><span style="">the judgment, as well as to the discretion of the Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we do </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">see how any
