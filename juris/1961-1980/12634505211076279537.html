				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1949" day="17" month="11">November <span style="">17, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>Francisca <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>
bought five hun­dred (500) square meters of land situated in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tata­lon</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city> for P<span style="">1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> </span>from the late Agustin de Torres, husband of <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> Guerrero.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This land was part of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate which
was the subject of a compro­mise agreement on <st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="3">March <span style="">16, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>subsequently approved by the Court
of First Instance, between the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> (one of whom
was <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> Guerrero as widow and successor of Agustin
Torres) and J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, in
consideration of P1<span class="GramE">,201,063.00</span> gave up their claim
over the estate, but in the agreement it was provided that J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., will recognize the contracts of sale en­tered
into by the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> over the said lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> buyers
(a list of them was furnished J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co.)
may, it was stipulated, continue the contracts of sale by paying J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., the current prices under conditions set
up by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, on <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="3">March <span style="">23, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co. sought before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, to eject Francisca <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> from the land through
an action for recovery based on alleged ownership.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As a result, the Court of First Instance rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="11">November 13, <span style="">1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>ordering
<span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> to vacate the land, remove her cons­tructions
and pay P<span style="">120.00 </span>monthly rental
from April <span style="">1948 </span>until
restoration of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> after the judgment became final, execution of the
judgment was or­dered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> moved on <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="3">March
 <span style="">7, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>to stay the execution but four days
later her motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
appealed this order of denial but the Court of First Instance dis­allowed her
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her motion for
reconsideration was denied, <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> filed in the Court
of Appeals a petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a><span style=""> </span>to
compel the Court of First Instance to approve her appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals dismissed her petition
on the ground that an order of execution of a final judgment is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1962</st1:date>,
upon motion of J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., and after the
finality of the Court of Appeals' decision, the Court of First Instance <span class="GramE">issued</span> a writ of demolition against <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She however moved to stay the enforcement of
the writ and was given until <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="4">April 1,
 1962</st1:date> to vacate the premises voluntarily - otherwise, the sheriff
will de­molish her house.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, in a petition for prohi­bition with preliminary
injunction before the Court of Ap­peals<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span style=""> </span>sought to enjoin the enforcement of
the decision <span style="">in
</span>Civil Case <span style="">No. </span><span class="GramE">Q-4193 and the enforcement of the demo­lition
order issued on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 27, 1962</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the Court of Appeals denied her
petition, holding that the decision in Civil Case No. Q-4193, having become
final and <span class="SpellE">execu­tory</span>, a writ of prohibition will not
lie to restrain en<span style="">forcement of the writ
of execution issued pursuant to the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It also ruled that the order denying the motion to suspend the
enforcement of the writ of execution and an order of demolition may not be
reviewed by a writ of certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> filed a new suit before the same Court of First
Instance<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> for the annulment of the judgment <span style="">in Civil </span>Case
No. <span class="GramE">Q-41930 on the ground of fraud, seeking to enjoin its
execution and the declaration of the orders of execution and demolition as null
and void.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also prayed for
specific performance on the part of <span style="">J.M.
</span><span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., praying that the latter be
ordered to execute a deed of sale of the land in her favor as per compromise
agreement of <st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="3">March 16, <span style="">1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>at P7.00 per square meter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of her
allegations of fraud she alleged </span>that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> vendee she sought the execution of
a new contract of sale in her favor in accordance with the agreement but was
told to wait until the approval of the subdivision plan of the <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span> Estate; that upon her re­ceipt of the notice of the
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, she went to the office of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc., managing partner of J.M. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tuason</span></span><span style=""> &amp; Co., and demanded an explanation; that the head of the
Investigation Department told her not to worry and to just give the case to a
lawyer, then forget it; that from then on she was assured that the case was a
mere formality devised to drive out the squatters, and any decision therein
would not really be executed against her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, even when judgment was given she did not take any step to vacate
or appeal the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, she
received a demolition order dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="1"><span style="">January </span>27, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., opposed the
petition and later moved for its dismissal on the grounds that the complaint
stated no cause of action or that if there was a cause of action, <span style="">the same was </span>barred
by prior judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First
Instance dismissed the case despite <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Lazo</span></span><span class="GramE"> 's</span> oppo­sition to the motion to dismiss, for the reason
that the complaint stated no cause of action because the plaintiff had lost her
preferential right according to the case of J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>, L-16836, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> Besides,
plaintiff herself asked for extension up to <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1962</st1:date> to vacate the premises which the court
interpreted as her admission that she was satisfied with the judgment against
her.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From this order of dismissal <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>
appealed to the Court of Appeals which in turn certified the case to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent the questions of
sufficiency of cause of ac­tion and bar by prior judgment, it must first be
determined whether the complaint to annul on ground of fraud should be allowed
in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Francisca </span><span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> claimed she never took steps to vacate or appeal the
judgment in Civil Case No. Q-4193 because she was assured it would not be
executed against her anyway, yet, when execution of the judgment was ordered on
<st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="1">Jan. <span style="">12, </span>1961</st1:date>, she never
questioned the judgment on the grounds <span style="">for
</span>which she now wants the same annulled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The execution order was indicative of the intent to ease her out of the
land, in disregard of the alleged assurance to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she still relied on such alleged
assurance, the writ of demolition issued January 27, 1962 against her undoubted­ly
left no doubt about the intentions of J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, she sought only
suspension of the enforcement of the writ of demolition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked, as found by the lower court, that
she be given until April 1, 1962 to vacate the premises - a fact that plainly
supports the conclusion that she acquiesced to the judgment sought to be
executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She unduly delayed too long
before alleging fraud in the circumstances leading to the rendition of the
judgment against her, when she could have asserted the same right after the
order of execution was given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such undue
de­lay from at least <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="1"><span style="">Jan. 12, </span>1961</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1962</st1:date>, considering the
continuous threat of her <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, mili­tates
against her case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And such circumstances
of delay can be discerned from the face of the complaint, in the light of its
reference to the records of <span style="">Civil </span>Case
No. <span class="GramE">Q-4193.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> or unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintiff
in enforcing <span style="">a
</span>right is persuasive of a want of merit, since <span style="">it is </span>human nature for one to assert his rights once threatened or
invaded, and may according go the <span style="">circumstances
be destructive </span>of the right itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> These
considerations negate the need of any further dis­cussion on the issues raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same renders the complaint subject to dismissal for lack of
cause of action (Sec. <span style="">1[f], </span>Rule
<span style="">8, </span>old Rules of Court) or
release, waiver and abandonment thereof (Sec. 1[g] Rule <span style="">8, </span>old and Sec.1 [a] Rule 16, new, Rules of <span style="">Court), </span>as regards that part seeking
to annul the deci­sion in <span style="">Civil </span>CaseNo.Q-4193
on the ground of fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the portion of the complaint seeking to enforce <span style="">an alleged preferential right to </span>buy
the land under the compromise agreement, the same is barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>as
