				<H3>JESUS JIMENEZ, SR., PROTESTANT AND APPELLEE, VS. MARGARITO LOFRANCO, PROTESTEE AND APPELLANT. GREGORIO APARECE, ET AL., PROTESTANTS AND APPELLANTS, VS. MARINO PACALDO, ET AL., PROTESTEES AND APPELLANTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are two election protests coming up from the Bohol court of
first instance. The first (No. 1305) concerns the office of Mayor,
Inabanga, Bohol, and the second (1315) relates to that of Vice-Mayor
and councilors of the same town.
<p>Said court declared protestant Jesus Jimenez the duly elected Mayor,
and protestants Gregorio Aparece and Councilor Lofranco, Vice-Mayor and
councilor respectively. According to the court, the first won by a
plurality of 504 votes, the second by 295 votes and the third by 222
votes.</p>
<p>The three losers went to the Court of Appeals for revision ; but the
latter forwarded the matter to this Tribunal. Two questions are
involved. The first is whether the lower court committed error in
rejecting as "marked" ballots containing the prefixes "Sr.", "Mr.",
"Datu", "Don", "Ginoo", "Hon.", "Dra.", "Gob.", etc.</p>
<p>The trial judge, Hon. Hipolito Alo, rejected hundreds of ballots for protestees<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> containing such prefixes for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In sustaining the invalidity of the ballots, we took into account the following circumstances:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(<em>a</em>)
In every ballot only one candidate is given a prefix, the rest none.
And we believe that such procedure was followed in order to identify
the elector who had prepared the ballot. Among the invalidated ballots
we do not find a single ballot where two candidates bear prefixes.</p>
    <p>(<em>b</em>)
In several ballots the prefixes given to one and the same candidate are
of different nature, thus facilitating the identity of the electors who
had prepared them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We are not oblivious of
our duty to use extreme caution before invalidating a ballot, but from
a cursory reading of the invalidated ballots, where different prefixes
are used, an impartial mind will be fully convinced that such prefixes
have no ether purpose than to identify the electors who had prepared
the ballots. It is for instance beyond human comprehension that while
in the ballot a candidate for councilor is given the prefix Hon., no
single candidate either for Senator or Governor is given tin same
prefix in that ballot, neither is the rest of the candidates given any
prefix.</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
  <p>Although Section 149, paragraph 5, of the Revised Election Code provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ballots
which contain prefixes such as "Sr.", "Mr.", "Datu","Don", "Guinoo",
"Hon.", "Dr", "Gob.", or suffixes like "hijo", "Jr.", "Segundo", are
valid.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>this law only applies if the prefixes were not used as identification marks."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon a review of the ballots with prefixes—which are all mentioned
in the decision—we cannot say that the trial judge committed legal
error in rejecting the same and practically declaring that the
protestees or their partisans, cleverly taking advantage of the
provisions of section 149, paragraph 5, devised a pattern or system to
mark and identify ballots and votes, and employed the same in the
different precincts. Let us consider the ballots in one precinct—No. 1
for instance which the judge invalidated:</p>

the candidate Lofranco was given <em>in the same precinct</em> about 30 different prefixes, none of them repeated. See this list of Precinct No. 2.</p>

<p>And this system of marking was used more or less extensively in 38 other precincts, of the 43 election precincts in that town.</p>
<p>Protestees alleged that the prefixes were used merely as a sign of
respect; and some witnesses were presented to that effect. Yet, it was
not shown that these were the same voters who had cast the marked
ballots. And it is incredible that one candidate from Pangasinan
(Quimson) should get such appellations as "Dato", "Dr.", "Hon.", "Sir",
"Ginoo", whereas none of Bohol received equally respectful appellations
in the same ballots. (The province had such candidates for Senator as
Borja and Pajo.)</p>
<p>Finally, although this is not necessarily conclusive, there is the telling circumstance that the protestees themselves regarded <em>as marked</em>—and
so objected thereto—other ballots of protestants that bore the same or
similar prefixes or suffixes. And the court, acting impartially,
sustained the objections, and rejected many ballots for protestants too.</p>
<p>As already stated, the use of prefixes to identify, appears to have
been used in forty out of the 43 election precincts of the
municipality. It would not be far-fetched to hold that appellees
cleverly, resorted to it, but the contest uncovered the deception, and
the court quite correctly frustrated it.</p>
<p>The second and last question is appellants' contention that the
trial judge should have invalidated the returns of the whole precinct
No. 5, after finding several ballots (12) written by two hands (each
ballots) and several ballots (5) written by one hand (all of them). We
hold that this has no merit, these—alone—being insufficient to justify
annulment of the balloting in the entire precinct. Anyway, the whole
precinct had only 132 votes (p. 105, brief of appellants) and supposing
they were all for protestants, the annulment thereof could not
obviously overcome their plurality specified at the beginning of this
decision (504, 295, 222 respectively).</p>
<p>Premises considered, the decision appealed from is affirmed. Costs against appellants.</p>
<em>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepción, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.
