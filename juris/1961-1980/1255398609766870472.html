				<H3>PILAR GREGORIO AND PACIFICO TUASON, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE EULOGIO MENCIAS, JUDGE OF THE SECOND BRANCH OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, AND MERCEDES N. DE RELUCIO, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari and mandamus to annul two orders of the 
Court of First Instance of Rizal, dated May 30, 1959 and September 17, 1959, in 
Civil Case No. 4640, entitled "Mercedes N. de Relucio, plaintiff-appellee, 
versus Pilar Gregorio and Pacifico Tuason, defendants-appellants, and to compel 
respondent judge to enter an order restoring Pilar Gregorio and Pacifico Tuason, 
petitioners, therein, to the possession of two lots subject matter of this case. 
The dispositive portion of the order of May 30, 1959, reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court hereby grants the motion for preliminary 
mandatory injunction filed by plaintiff (Mercedes N. de Relucio). Let a writ of 
preliminary mandatory injunction be issued in this case in favor of the 
plaintiff, upon the latter's posting of a bond in the amount of P15,000.00, to 
be submitted to this Court for its approval." (Name supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Order of September 17, 1959, denied defendants-appellants' motion for 
reconsideration of the above order.</p>
<p>The record discloses the following facts: The lots involved in this action 
are two fishponds, formerly designated as Lots Nos. 48 and 61, but presently 
known as Lots Nos. 5 and 7, Block 22, Longos Estate, which previously belonged 
to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila (MITRA). These lots were leased by 
the MITRA to one Ariston Nuñez, who had introduced improvements thereon. After 
his death in 1924, his leasehold rights thereon were transferred to his widow, 
Esperanza Garcia, and to his only daughter, Mercedes Nuñez de Relucio. Upon the 
death of Esperanza Garcia, said leasehold rights exclusively belonged to said 
Mercedes Nuñez de Relucio.</p>
<p>Sometime in 1947 the Loñgos Estate, together with other haciendas belonging 
to the MITRA, were sold by the latter to the Republic of the Philippines, free 
from any liens or encumbrances, excepting leases. Pursuant to Commonwealth Act 
No. 539, the Rural Progress Administration took over the administration and 
disposition of said Estate. In November, 1950, the Rural Progress Administration 
was abolished and its powers and duties were transferred to the Landed Estates 
Division of the Bureau of Lands.</p>
<p>On May 20, 1955 Mercedes N. de Relucio filed with the Landed Etates Division 
a formal application for the purchase of said fishponds. Eligio Estella of the 
Bureau of Lands, conducted an investigation, and on May 25, 1955, rendered a 
report, recommending approval of Relucio's application. (Annex 3 to Joint 
Answer)</p>
<p>No action, however, was taken by the Bureau of Lands upon Relucio's 
application for the purchase of the lots. On September 9,1955, Republic Act 1400 
was approved and by virtue thereof, the Landed Estates Division of the Bureau of 
Lands was abolished and its powers and functions were transferred to the newly 
created Land Tenure Administration.</p>
<p>On October 11, 1952, Mercedes N. de Relucio leased said fishponds to Pilar 
Gregorio for a period of four years, starting from August 5, 1952 and ending on 
<em>August 5, 1956</em>. The lease contract was embodied in a public instrument, 
and in this document, Pilar Gregorio agreed to deliver the fishponds at the 
expiration of the contract on August 5, 1956 and to relinquish all the 
improvements made by her on the fishponds during the time of her occupation as 
lessee (Annex 4—Joint Answer). On August 5, 1956, Relucio notified Pilar 
Gregorio to vacate the lots and to deliver possession thereof to her (Relucio), 
in accordance with the terms of the lease contract. Because of the refusal of 
Pilar Gregorio to do so, Relucio filed on October 15, 1956, Civil Case No. 1340, 
and entitled "Mercedes N. de Relucio, plaintiff, vs. Pilar Gregorio and Pacifico 
Tuason, defendants" for unlawful detainer and damages, before the JP Court of 
Malabon, Rizal. On Otober 29, 1956, the defendants filed an answer, admitting 
therein the existence of the lease contract mentioned in the complaint and the 
termination thereof on August 5, 1956, but claiming as a special defense, that 
they "continue to be in possession of Lots 5 and 7 with the sanction and 
authorization of the Land Tenure Administration * * *."</p>
<p>On January 4, 1957, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the LTA, 
filed with the CFI of Rizal, an action with preliminary injunction, against 
Mercedes N. de Relucio and JP of Malabon (docketed as Civ. Case No. 4397, 
entitled "Republic of the Philippines, etc., plaintiff, vs. Mercedes N. de 
Relucio, et al., defendants), to recover from defendant Relucio the sum of 
P46,633.34 by way of unpaid rentals and to compel her co-defendant Justice of 
the Peace to desist from further proceeding with Civil Case No. 1340, pending in 
his court. A writ of preliminary injunction was issued, but thereafter, upon 
motion of the defendant Relucio, the same was dissolved upon the latter's filing 
a bond of P10,000.00.</p>
<p>The hearing of Civil Case No. 1340 by the Justice of the Peace of Malabon 
continued. After a protracted trial, the Justice of the Peace, rendered, on July 
10, 1957, a judgment ordering defendant Pilar Gregorio and her husband Pacifico 
Tuason to vacate the premises and to deliver the same to plaintiff Relucio, and 
to pay said plaintiff the sum of P433.50 as monthly rentals from August 6, 1956 
until the lots shall have been vacated. From this decision, defendants spouses 
appealed to the CFI of Rizal, which appeal is docketed as Civil Case No. 
<em>4640</em> of that court and is mentioned in the earlier part of this 
decision. On August 8, 1957, the Land Tenure Administration, filed and served 
upon appellee Relucio a petition to intervene in Civil Case No. 4640, which 
petition was, on March 24, 1959, denied by said court. The order of denial was 
not appealed. Under date of August 21, 1957, defendants-appellants filed their 
Answer in Civil Case No. 4640, alleging as special defenses that the 
relationship of landlord and tenant between them and the appellee had terminated 
on August 5, 1956, and that they (Spouses Gregorio and Tuason) are now in 
possession of the fishponds by virtue of another lease contract entered into 
with the Government.</p>
<p>After the perfection of the appeal, appellee Relucio on September 2, 1957, 
filed a petition for the issuance of a <em>writ of preliminary mandatory 
injunction</em>, invoking the provisions of articles 539 and 1674 of the new 
Civil Code. In her petition, appellee averred that the appealed case of unlawful 
detainer was decided in her favor by the Justice of the Peace of Malabon; that 
she has a good and valid cause of action; that the appeal interposed by the 
defendants is frivolous and purely dilatory, and that the unlawful detention of 
the fishponds by appellants have caused irreparable damage to appellee. </p>
<p>In opposition thereto, the appellants claim that the appellee, Relucio, has 
lost her right to file the petition because she did not do so within 10 days 
from the time of the perfection of the appeal (July 29, 1957); and that 
appellants have a valid defense and have filed a supersedeas bond to answer for 
whatever damage the appellee may suffer. The Land Tenure Administration likewise 
filed a written opposition, claiming that the writ will affect the interests of 
the Government. On September 20, 1957, the appellee in her reply to the 
oppositions, argued that the motion was filed on time and that defendants' 
appeal was not meritorious because: (a) they cannot deny appellee's title to the 
lots; (b) the appellee has the right to recover the possession of the lots upon 
the expiration of the lease contract; (c) the question of ownership of the 
fishponds is extreneous to the issue involved, which is merely <i>de facto</i> 
possession; (d) the Land Tenure Administration has no personality to appear in 
said case, because its petition to intervene has not been granted.</p>
<p>On May 23, 1959, the respondent Court set the petition for preliminary 
mandatory injunction for hearing. Both parties appeared with their respective 
counsel, and submitted the petition for consideration of the Court. On May 30, 
1959, the court issued the order sought herein to of said order was denied by 
the court on September 17, be annulled. An "omnibus Motion for Reconsideration" 
1959. This is the other order also sought to be voided. Hence this petition.</p>
<p>The present petition was given due course and a writ of preiminary injunction 
was issued on November 18, 1959, as prayed for in the petition, upon filing of a 
bond of P10,000.00. In compliance therewith, the respondent court on November 
27, 1959 ordered respondent Relucio to deliver possession of said lots back to 
the petitioners. A motion dated December 3, 1959 filed by respondent Relucio, to 
set aside the writ issued, and to file a counterbond, was denied by this Court, 
on December 8, 1959.</p>
<p>It being a well established doctrine that in cases involving issuance of a 
preliminary injunction, this Court will not interfere with the exercise of sound 
discretion of a lower court (Rudolfa vs. Alfonso, 76 Phil. 225), it is important 
to determine in this petition whether or not the respondent judge has committed 
grave abuse of discretion in issuing the two orders complained of.</p>
<p>In support of their claim that the disputed orders are null and void, 
petitioners contend that (a) respondent Relucio did not file on time her motion 
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction; (b) respondent 
judge granted the motion without receiving evidence to support the diputed 
orders; and (c) the appeal of petitioners is not frivolous because they have a 
valid defense, which is, that petitioners are no longer tenants of respondobts 
Relucio, but that they are now occupying the fishponds as lessees of the Land 
Tenure Administration.</p>
<p>Petitioners predicated their first contention upon the provisions of article 
539 in relation to article 1674 of the Civil Code, arguing that the 10 days 
period should be counted from the perfection of the appeal, and in the present 
case, the motion for the mandatory preliminary injunction was filed beyond said 
period. The articles in question are hereunder reproduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 1674. In ejectment cases where an appeal is taken, the remedy granted 
in article 539, second paragraph, shall also apply, if the higher court is 
satisfied that the lessee's appeal is frivolous or dilatory, or that the 
lessor's appeal is prima facie meritorious. The period of ten days referred to 
in said article shall be counted from the time the appeal is perfected".</p>
<p>"Art 539. Every possessor has a right to be respected in his possession and 
should he be disturbed therein he shall be protected in or restored to said 
possession by the means established by the laws and the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>A possessor deprived of his possession through forcible entry may within ten 
days from the filing of the complaint present a motion to secure from the 
competent court, in the action for forcible entry, a writ of preliminary 
mandatory injunction to restore him in his possession. The court shall decide 
the motion within thirty (30) days from filing thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first contention cannot be sustained, in view of our ruling in the case 
of De la Cruz vs. Bocar, et al., 99 Phil., 491, pertinent portions of which read 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With respect to the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction 
against Cruz in Civil Case No. 3110, of the Court of First Instance, we gather 
from the pleadings filed in the said Court marked as annexes by both parties 
that petitioner Cruz claims that the petition for the issuance of the writ was 
filed beyond the ten days period fixed by Art. 1674 of the New Civil Code for 
the reason that the appeal was perfected on November 2, 1954, and the motion for 
the issuance of the writ was filed on November 23, 1954. Plaintiff Rufina and 
Company, however, explained that the said ten days should be counted not from 
the actual date of the perfection of the appeal which was on November 19, 1954. 
We agree with plaintiff-respondent. An appellee in a case appealed from the 
Justice of the Peace Court to the Court of First Instance is not called upon to 
be always on guard in the Justice of the Peace Court to ascertain the exact date 
and hour the appeal is perfected. All that an appellee is expected to do is to 
wait for the official notice to him of said perfected appeal from the Court of 
First Instance where the appeal is taken. Otherwise, said appellee may be 
prematurely filing a petition for the issuance of a writ of preliminary 
mandatory injunction in the Court of First Instance before the appeal is 
actually received by the said court; and said appellee would not know how to 
entitle or number his petition, and the Clerk of Court may not admit said 
petition because there is as yet no case or record of a case to which it may be 
attached and incorporated. <em>We, therefore, rule that the period of ten days 
mentioned in Art. 1674 within which to file a petition for a writ of preliminary 
mandatory injunction should be counted from the date when the petitioning party 
is notified of the perfection of the appeal.</em>" (Italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>And the above ruling can not be otherwise, also for other reasons. A literal 
interpretation given to the provisionsm of law under discussion, would prove the 
extraordinary remedy of preliminary mandatory injunction unavailing. The 
issuance of such writ in an ejectment case is expressly vested in the appellate 
court because the law employs the phrase "higher court", and it is the higher 
court which must satisfy itself that the appeal is either frivolous or dilatory, 
in the case of the lessee, or <em>prima facie</em> meritorious in the case of 
the lessor. The record of an appealed case, whether from a municipal court or 
court of first instance, is invariably remanded to, or received by, the clerk of 
the appellate court beyond 10 days from the perfection of the appeal. And this 
happens despite the mandate of the law requiring clerks of court to transmit the 
record of an appealed case within a specified period (within 5 days in the case 
of municipal or justice of the peace courts, section 5, Rule 40, and within 10 
days in the case of courts of first instance, section 11, Rule 41, Rules of 
Court), a plain ministerial duty on the part of these court officials of which 
parties litigants have no intervention whatsoever. ( See Sycip vs. Hon. Judge E. 
Soriano, et al., [CA] 52 Off. Gaz. 1474)</p>
<p>There are no potent or cogent reasons advanced to reverse or in any manner 
alter said ruling, which finds a fitting application to the facts obtaining in 
the case at bar. The Code Commission, it should be recalled, has stated that the 
purpose of said article 1674 Civil Code (supra) is to prevent the lessee from 
<em>unduly</em> prolonging possession of the leased properties during an appeal. 
Admittedly, when respondent Relucio filed on September 2, 1957 her motion for 
preliminary mandatory injunction, she had not even received from the trial court 
a notice of the appealed case, and the period of limitation had not 
commenced.</p>
<p>It is not true that the trial court did not have evidence to support its 
disputed orders. The lower court had set the motion for hearing on September 14, 
1957 and May 23, 1959 with the sole purpose of receiving evidence. It was during 
these hearings that respondent Relucio presented several exhibits as evidence, 
and the petitioners had none. The evidence submitted by respondent Relucio, the 
pleadings filed by both parties and the decision of the Justice of the Peace 
Court of Malabon, were taken into consideration by the respondent court as basis 
for granting the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. As shown by the 
stenographic notes, petitioners' counsel just submitted the matter of the 
issuance of the injunction to the court for resolution.</p>
<p>Petitioners claim that their appeal is not frivolous; that they were no 
longer tenants of respondent Relucio, and were then in possession of the 
fishponds as lessees of the Land Tenure Administration (LTA); and that they 
vacated the lots in question from August 6, to August 9, 1956, after the 
termination of the contract of lease with Relucio. These claims were, however, 
denied by respondent Relucio and do not also reflect the truth. In petitioner 
Gregorio's application for the purchase of the fishponds, filed with the LTA on 
August 17, 1956 (Annex B to Petition), she unequivocably stated, thus—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. I have been an occupant of the Longos Estate/Homesite from August 5, 1952 
to present and/or the lots applied for from August 5, 1952 to present. * * * 
"</p></blockquote>
<p>In denying petitioner Gregorio's application, the LTA, on August 24, 1956, 
wrote—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * please be informed that after an investigation conducted by a 
representative of this Office you have been occupying the premises only as a 
lessee of Mrs. Mercedes N. Relucio since the year 1952. * * *." (Annex C of 
Petition). </p></blockquote>
<p>On August 28, 1956, petitioner Gregorio again wrote to the LTA (Annex D to 
Petition), stating that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am at present in actual, material and physical possession of said lots 
since August 5, 1952. * * *." </p></blockquote>
<p>Still in another application for the lease of the lots dated September 6, 
1956 (Annex E to Petition), petitioner Gregorio reiterated that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2. I have been an occupant of said lots from August 5, 1952 to the present; 
said occupation was/is material, actual and physical * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>Although during the months of August and September, 1956, petitioner Gregorio 
had been negotiating for the lease of the fishponds from the LTA, after her 
application to purchase the same was denied, the required bond of P6,000, which 
finalized the lease contract, was approved by the LTA only on October 18, 1956, 
one day after the filing of the action for unlawful detainer. This being the 
case, petitioners can not now deny the title of their lessor, respondent 
Relucio; neither can they assert any right adverse to said title, which may 
change their relationship (Art. 1436, New Civil Code, Sec. 68-b, Rule 123, Rules 
of Court); and can not plausibly establish a defense that another lease contract 
then existed with the LTA.</p>
<p>This is on one hand. On the other, respondent Relucio's evidence discloses, 
that she and her predecessors-in-interest have been in possession of the leased 
properties, as lessees of the MITRA, for many many years and that she had 
introduced substantial improvements thereon. Petitioners' only claim of damages 
consisted in the improvements allegedly made in the fishponds, during the four 
(4) year period of the lease contract. But petitioner Gregorio had agreed to 
turn over said improvements to respondent Relucio upon the expiration of the 
lease.</p>
<p>Under the facts herein obtaining, it becomes abundantly clear that respondent 
judge, in promulgating the Orders complained of, did not act without or in 
excess of his jurisdiction. No instance has been shown that there was any abuse, 
much less grave or capricious, of discretion, practiced by said respondent 
judge. The petitioners have not also established any clear right, so as to 
render the refusal of respondent Judge to order the restoration of the 
properties in litigation to them, an unlawful exclusion from the use and 
enjoyment of such right.</p>
<p>The petition for Certiorari and Mandamus is dismissed, for lack of merit. The 
Orders of the respondent Judge dated May 30, 1959 and September 17, 1959 are 
affirmed. The writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued by this Court is 
dissolved. With costs against petitioners.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
