				<H3>MANUEL UY, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ENRICO PALOMAR, IN HIS CAPACITY AS POSTMASTER GENERAL, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ZALDIVAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> filed a complaint with the
Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 55678) against the Postmaster
General, praying for an injunction to restrain said Postmaster General and his
subordinates, agents or representatives from enforcing Fraud Order No. 3, dated
November 22, 1963, declaring Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Sweepstakes
Agency as conducting <span style="">a </span>lottery
or gift enterprise and directing all postmasters and other employees of the
Bureau of Posts concerned to return to the sender any mail matter addressed to
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Sweepstakes Agency or to any of its agents
or representatives with the notation "Fraudulent" stamped upon the
cover of such mail matter, and prohi­biting the issuance or payment of any
money order or teleg­raphic transfer to the said agency or to any of its agents
and representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As
prayed for in the complaint, a writ of prelimi</span>nary injunction was issued
<u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Postmaster General moved for the
dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction, but the motion was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Postmaster General filed an answer to the com­plaint, setting
up the defense that Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span style="">was </span><span style="">con­</span>ducting
a lottery or gift enterprise that <span style="">is </span>prohibited by law; that <span style="">as </span>Postmaster
General he has the authority to issue the fraud order in <span style="">question and </span>he did not abuse his
discretion in doing so; and that Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> had not
exhausted all the <span style="">administrative remedies before in­voking judicial intervention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court, on the </span><span style="">basis </span><span style="">of the stipulation
of facts submitted </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the parties, declared Fraud </span><span style="">Order </span>No. 3 contrary to law and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the rights of the plaintiff and made permanent
the preliminary injunction previously issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Postmaster General appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The salient facts gathered from the stipulation of facts and
culled from the briefs of the parties are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
for short) <span style="">is </span><span style="">a </span>duly <span style="">authorized agent or the Philippine Charity
Sweepstakes Office (PCSO, for short), </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">government entity created and empowered by </span>law to hold
sweepstakes draws and lotteries for charitable <span style="">and public purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such
agent of the </span><span style="">PCSO, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is engaged in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">sale and distribution or sweepstakes and
lottery tickets which the PCSO prints and issues for each and every one of the
not less than twenty draws that said office annually holds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To carry out its business of selling sweepstakes
and lottery tickets issued by the </span>PCSO, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
upon authority of the said office, employs sub-agents throughout the
Philippines, through which sub­agents not less <span style="">than 70% of </span><span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> total <span style="">sales </span>for <span style="">each draw are made;
and, with the consent of the PCSO, <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span> agrees
to give 50% of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">agent's prize to the sub­agent selling the prize-winning ticket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agent's prize is 10% of the prize won by
the ticket sold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the Grand Christmas Sweepstakes Draw which would be held on
December 15, 1963, the PCSO fixed the first, second and third prizes at
P700,000.00, P350,000.00, and <span style="">P175,000.00,
respectively, and set a sale goal of P6,000,000.00 worth </span>of
tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PCSO directed its duly
authorized agents to undertake every means possible to help achieve the
six-million-peso sales goal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In com­pliance
with said directive, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> devised and, through
his representatives, offered to the public, the "Grand Christmas Bonus
Award" plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plan was designed
to boost the sales of tickets for the PCSO Grand Christmas Sweepstakes
Draw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said plan, the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> sub-agents and purchasers of <u>whole</u>
sweepstakes tickets sold by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and his
sub-agents may, in addition to the regular prize money of the December 15, 1963
draw, win bonuses and awards as follows: for the sub-agent and buyer of the
ticket winning the first prize, one 1963 Volkswagen sedan each; for the
sub-agent and buyer of the ticket winning the second prize, one <span class="SpellE">Radiowealth</span> 23-inch television set each; for the sub-agent
and buyer of the ticket winning the third prize, one <span class="SpellE">Radiowealth</span>
refrige­rator each; for the sub-agents and buyers or the tickets winning any of
the six fourth prizes, one <span class="SpellE">Radiowealth</span> sewing machine
each; and for the sub-agent and buyer of the ticket winning the charity prize,
one <span class="SpellE">Radiowealth</span> Fiesta "hi-fi" radio set
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for the amount paid for the
authorized price of the sweepstakes tickets, those entitled to benefit from the
plan did not have to pay any other amount in consideration of the right to benefit
from the plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The awards may be claimed
by presenting to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the sales invoice of
the winning tickets, in the case of the sellers, and the eight shares of the
winning tickets, in the case of the buyers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforementioned plan is a modification (or alter­native plan,
as the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> calls it) of the original scheme
presented by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, thru counsel, to the
Assistant Postmaster General in <span style="">a </span>letter dated October 15, 1963, and which
the latter, in his answer dated October 18, 1963, considered as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Postal Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> advertised his "Grand
Christmas Bonus Award" plan, <span style="">as </span>described above, in the metropolitan news­papers
of nationwide circulation, the first of such ad­vertisements appearing in seven
such newspapers in their issues of <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="11">November
 18, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The newspaper
advertisements were repeated almost every week after <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1963</st1:date>, with the last of them
published in the issue of the "Daily Mirror" of <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the fraud order in question was issued by the
Postmaster-General (appellant, for short) under date of <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it was only on December 10, 1963
that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> came to know of the issuance and
context thereof when he sought clarification from the Manila Post Office why
his parcels con­taining sweepstakes tickets for <span style="">his sub-agents, as well as his other mail matters of purely personal
nature, </span>were refused acceptance for mailing the day previous.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed the complaint,
mentioned at the beginning of this opinion, alleging among others, that in
issuing <span style="">Fraud Order No. </span>3 the
appellant "has acted arbitrarily or gravely exceeded his authority, and/or
committed an error of law."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Disclaiming that in issuing the <span style="">fraud order </span>he acted arbitrarily, or gravely exceeded his
authority and/or com­mitted an error of law, appellant, in his answer to the
complaint, cites as basis or his action, the provisions of Sections 1954 (a);
1982, and 1983 of the Postal Law (Chap­ter 52 or the Revised Administrative
Code), pertinent portions or which read:</p>

by any postmaster of any postal money order or telegraphic transfer to said
person or company, or to the agent of any such person or company, whether such
agent is acting as an </span><span style="">individual </span><span style="">or as a firm,

(Underscoring supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Invoking the phrase "upon evidence satisfactory to
him", the appellant contends that the fraud order in question was legally
issued because he had been satis­fied with the evidence presented to him that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was conducting a lottery or gift enterprise.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
We note that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> does not question the
authority of the appellant, under Section 1954 (a), 1982 and 1983 <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>, to prohibit the use of the mails, the money
order system and the telegraphic transfer service for the promotion of
lotteries, gift enterprises or fraud­ulent schemes.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, appellant would be remiss in the performance of his duties should he
fail to exercise his authority under the Postal Law if and when the <span style="">mails, the money order system, and the
telegraphic trans­<span style="">fer </span></span><span style="">service are
utilized </span><span style="">for the promotion or <span style="">lotteries, </span>gift enterprises </span><span style="">and <span style="">similar
</span>schemes prohibited by </span><span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's
authority, however, </span><span style="">is not
absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Neither does </span><span style="">the law
give him unlimited discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appel­lant
may only exercise his authority if there is a clear showing that the mails, the
money order system and the telegraphic transfer service are used to promote </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">scheme </span><span style="">or enterprise prohibited by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the present case,
therefore, </span>the question that must be resolved is whether <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> "Grand Christmas Bonus Award" plan
constitutes <span style="">a
</span>lottery, gift enterprise, <span style="">or
similar </span>scheme proscribed by the Postal Law, afore-quoted, as would
authorize the appellant to issue the fraud order <span style="">in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Before <span style="">we </span>resolve the question, however, we wish to advert to the claim
of the appellant that he had made <span style="">his
decision </span>based upon satisfactory evidence that the "Grand Christmas
Bonus Award" plan of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is a lot­tery or
gift enterprise for the distribution of gifts by chance, and his decision in
this regard cannot <span style="">be </span>reviewed
by the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, the appellant, in his brief<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>,
says:</p>

<blockquote>"It is respectfully submitted that corollary to the rule that
courts can­not interfere in the performance of or­dinary duties of <span style="">the </span>executive department is the
equally compelling rule that decisions of the defendant on questions <span style="">of fact are final and conclusive and
generally cannot be reviewed by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For it cannot be denied that the Post­master General is charged with
quasi-ju­dicial functions and vested with discre­tion in determining what is <span class="SpellE">mailable</span> mat­ter and in withholding from the plaintiff the
privilege of using the mail, the money order system and the telegraphic
transfer service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> As the disputed Fraud Order No. 3 was issued

decision had no reasonable basis whatever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither can it be said </span><span style="">that
</span><span style="">he exceeded his authority nor
that he abused his discretion."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this connection </span>it
may be stated that the Postal Law contains no provision for judicial review of
the decision of <span style="">the </span>Postmaster
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, in Reyes
vs. <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
had stated that the action of the Director of Posts (now Postmaster General) <span style="">is </span>sub<span style="">ject to revision </span>by the courts in case
he exceeded his authority or his act is palpably wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in "El Debate" Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said that the courts will not interfere with <span style="">the </span>decision of <span style="">the </span>Director
of Posts (Postmaster General) as to what <span style="">is, </span>and what is not, <span class="SpellE">mailable</span>
matter unless clearly of opinion that it was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the courts will in<span style="">terfere with the decision or </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Postmaster General if it clearly appears that the decision is
wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, by said rulings,
recognizes the availability of judicial review over </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">action of the </span><span style="">Postmaster
Gen­</span><span style="">eral, notwithstanding the
absence of statutory pro­vision for judicial review of his action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not </span><span style="">be amiss to state that said rulings are in consonance with American
jurisprudence to the effect that the ab­sence of statutory provisions for
judicial review does not necessarily mean that access to the courts is
barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The silence of the Congress is
not to be cons­</span><span style="">trued as
indicating a legislative intent to preclude judicial review</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">American</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">School</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> of Magnetic </span><span style="">Healing vs. <span class="SpellE">McAnnulty</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, the U.S. Supreme Court, speak­</span><span style="">ing on the power of the courts to review the

<blockquote>"That the conduct of the <span class="SpellE">postoffice</span> <span style="">is </span>a part of the administrative
department of the government is entirely true, but that does not necessarily
and always oust the courts of jurisdiction to grant relief <span style="">to a party aggrieved by any action by the
head, or one of the subordinate officials, of that Department, which is
unauthorized by the statute under </span><span style="">which
he assumes to </span><span style="">act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts of all its officers must be
justified by some </span><span style="">law; </span><span style="">and in case an of­ficial

relief."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also invokes the doctrine of exhaustion of
administrative remedies, and asserts that the action of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
in the present case was premature be­cause he had not first appealed the fraud
order to higher administrative authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This assertion of appellant has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule on exhaustion of ad­ministrative
remedies is not a hard and fast one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
admits of exceptions, amongst which are: (1) where the question involved <span style="">is </span>purely a <span style="">legal one</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>,
and (2) where there are circumstances indicating the urgency or ju­dicial
intervention<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question involved in the present case is
legal -- whether or not the "Grand Christ­mas Bonus Award" plan of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, based upon the facts as stipulated, is <span style="">a </span>lottery
or gift enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We take note that
the Grand Christmas Sweepstakes draw in con­junction with which <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> plan was offered, was scheduled for <st1:date year="1903" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1903</st1:date>, or barely five
days from <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1963</st1:date>,
the date when <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> learned of the issuance of the
fraud order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time was of the essence to
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now resolve the main question in this case, name­ly, whether
or not <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> "Grand Christmas Bonus <span style="">Award" plan constitutes a lottery or </span><span style="">a gift </span><span style="">enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no statutory definition of </span>the terms "lottery"
<span style="">and "gift enterprise".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in the </span><span style="">case or "El

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> while countless defini­tions or lottery have been

prize; and third, chance (Horner vs. United States [1982] 147 U.S. 449; Public

laid down the test in more definitive terms, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The examination of authorities made in the present case

<p class="BODY">The test indicated in the foregoing rulings simply means that

differently, there is considera­tion or price paid if <span style="">it </span>appears that the prizes offered, by whatever name they may be

the sale of chances among the participants in order to win the prizes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, if the prizes do not come out of

there being no "contribu­tion in kind to the fund or property to be

also relied upon although only in so far as the element of chance is concerned

other meaning than that which is consistent with the nature of the word
associated therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, if lottery
is prohibited only if it involves a consideration, so also must the term 'gift
enterprise' be so construed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
there is not in the law the slightest <span class="SpellE">indicium</span> of any
intent to eliminate that element of consideration from the 'gift enterprise'
therein included.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
