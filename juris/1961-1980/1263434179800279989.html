<p class="BODY">Following is a summary of the evidence presented by the
prosecution:</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 7, 1967, Sgts. Bonifacio Bonotan and Salvador Geraldo,
both members of the 431st PC Company, were at Caputian Island to conduct an
investigation of the reported suicide of a Chinese named Pa Uy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about 10:30 in the morning of the same
date, some fishermen reported that they had very little catch that morning
because there were Muslims who had been dynamite fish­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Responding to said report, the two PC
soldiers boarded a PC 40 HP motor boat with Felix Bildera, a civilian, as
motorman, and pulled out to sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of
the accused, who were in two ban­cas, were caught with the dynamited fish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After their arrest, the two bancas were towed
with a rope, one behind the other, by the PC motorboat towards the direction of
the PC Barracks at Davao City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On board
the FIRST BANCA immediately behind the PC motorboat, were the accused Abubakar
Aplasi, Mastalgari Pawaki, Janay Apsari and <u>Tambutso Patuhin</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aboard the SECOND BANCA, which was farther
from the PC motorboat, were the accused <u>Samin­di Cosing</u>, <u>Jayri Jamari</u>
and <u>Tambusong Mohamadsali</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before
long, another motorboat of 18 HP (the ATTACKING MOTORBOAT) carrying the accused
Pangalasan Anodin, Pabling (Bisaya), Jawali (Badjao), Madai Santalani,
Montalgawi Tolawi, Talasan Sansiwi, and Sapal Jabal, intercepted the PC
motorboat while still in the open sea between Talicud Island and Samal Island.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pabling (Bisaya), still at-large at the time
of the trial, acting as the leader of the group in the ATTACKING MOTORBOAT
together with Jawali (Badjao), also a fugitive from justice, tried to negotiate
with the apprehending PC Sergeants for the release of the arrested fishermen
and of the bancas which were being towed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Failing in their efforts, Pabling (Bisaya) suddenly threw a stick of
dynamite at the PC motorboat but did not hit the PC soldiers.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, at least three shots were heard to have been fired by the PC
soldiers and Jawali (Badjao) was, in fact, hit and was bleeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Pabling (Bisaya) and Jawali (Badjao) then each threw two more sticks of
dynamite at the PC motorboat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One PC
soldier was thrown out of the PC motorboat after one of the explosions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants <u>Tambutso Patu­hin</u> in the
FIRST BANCA, and <u>Tambusong Mohamadsali</u> and <u>Samin­di Cosing</u> in the
SECOND BANCA also threw dynamite sticks at the PC motorboat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the dynamiting was over, Pabling
(Bisaya) and Jawali (Badjao) picked up the dead bodies of the other PC soldier
and the civilian in the PC motorboat, tied a stone each to their feet and
dropped them into the sea.</p>

<p class="BODY">A PC patrol was dispatched to the sea area to hunt for the
culprits and to recover the bodies of the victims but this proved
unsuccessful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only pieces of the PC
motorboat as well as the out­board motor itself were recovered (Exhibits F and
G).</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no eyewitness to the crime committed in the open
sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lead came when one of the
investigating officers, Captain Avelon, came upon the accused Sapal Jabal at
Piapi, Davao City, repainting a banca.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When about to be apprehended, Sapal Jabal ran but was chased and
apprehended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he was
with the group who dynamited the PC motorboat and likewise mentioned as his
companions Talasan Sansiwi, Mantol­gawi Tolawi, Pangalawan Anodin and Madai
Santalani.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appre­hension of the eleven
other accused followed thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Investi­gation was conducted by the PC in the Tausog dialect, a dialect
understood by the accused, which was interpreted to them by Corporal
Espantaleon (Exhibits C, D, E, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q and R), wherein they
respectively admitted having been with the group and described their respective
participations in the dynamiting incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Statements were sworn to, some before Assistant Provincial Fiscal
Matondo, Jr. and others before Spe­cial Counsel Escovilla.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite their confessions, the accused, testifying individ­ually,
except for Talasan Sansiwi, who is dumb and did not take the witness stand,
denied having killed the victims and invoked the common defense of alibi,
claiming that they were not present at the scene of the crime during the
alleged time of its commission but were in their respective homes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contradicting the evidence presented by the prosecution to
establish the voluntariness of the extrajudicial confessions they had executed,
they countered that they suffered different forms of mal­treatment inflicted
upon their persons by the PC soldiers during the investigation to force them to
affix their thumbmarks in their re­spective Affidavits and to admit complicity
in the killing of the two PC soldiers and one civilian.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower Court held that "the following
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pabling (Bisaya) and Jawali
(Badjao), who are still at large, Tam­butso Patuhin, Samindi Cosing and Jayri
Jamari and Tambusong Mohamadsali were all responsible for the act of throwing
dynamites which blasted the two (2) PC soldiers and one (1) civilian."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Although, according to the trial Court, the accused <u>Tambutso Pa­tuhin</u>, <u>Samindi
Cosing</u> and <u>Jayri Jamari</u> mentioned in their respect­ive statements
that they did not hit the PC motorboat, the trial Court opined that "there
was concert of action with the leader of the group who blasted the said PC
soldiers and thereby proved the existence of conspiracy among them."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sentence was meted out accordingly, as heretofore quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellants, through their counsel <u>de</u>
<u>officio</u>, attribute to the trial Court the following errors:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICT­ING THE

COMPANION NAMED FELIX BILDERA.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CON­VICTING THE
ACCUSED-APPELLANTS WHEN, EVEN ASSUMING THAT THEIR ALLEGED EXTRAJUDICIAL
CONFESSIONS ARE VALID AND ADMISSIBLE IN EVI­DENCE, THE PROSECUTION DID NOT
ESTABLISH THAT THERE WAS A CRIMI­NAL CONSPIRACY AMONG THEM AND THE PERSONS WHO
ACTUALLY KILLED THE ALLEGED VICTIMS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CON­VICTING SAPAL
JABAL AS AN ACCES­SORY TO THE CRIME CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION, THERE BEING NO
EVI­DENCE TO SHOW THAT THE ACTS IM­PUTED TO HIM FALL WITHIN THE PUR­VIEW OF
ARTICLE 19 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The third assigned error relative to Sapal Jabal need not be
considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not an appellant,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and he has passed away, according to a Manifestation, dated May 26, 1969,
submitted by <u>counsel</u> <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact that, in its
judgment, the trial Court relied heavily on the extra-judicial confessions
executed by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
would have us believe that duress and violence were used in procuring those
affidavits from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not
persuaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corporal Felipe T. Tuvilla,
who took the statements of Madai San­talani, Jany Apsari, Sapal Jabal, Tambutso
Patuhin, and Abubakar Aplasi (Exhibits K to R) declared that the statements
were given free­ly and voluntarily.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Sgt. Carbonnel, who obtained the statements of <u>Samindi Cosing</u> and <u>Tambusong
Mohamadsali</u> (Exhibits C and E) also made a similar declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assistant Provincial Fiscal Maton­do; before whom
Madai Santalani, Mantolgawi Tolawi, Jany Apsari, Sapal Jabal, Tambutso Patuhin,
Pangalawan Anodin, Mastalgari Pawaki, Abubakar Aplasi subscribed their
statements, declared that he interrogated the accused and each one of them
voluntarily admit­ted the contents thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, he added that relative to the State­ment of Sapal Jabal
(Exhibit O), this accused repudiated a particular portion of his statement and
denied participation in the killing so that he crossed it out (Q. &amp; A. No.
12, Exhibit O).<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> Fiscal
Mantilla also testified that he was with the PC patrol dispatched to the crime
scene and he knew for a fact that the accused <u>Tambusong Mohamad­sali</u> and
Pangalawan Anodin volunteered to point to the exact spot where the blasting
took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Special Counsel Escovilla,
before whom <u>Tambusong Mohamadsali</u> and <u>Samindi Cosing</u> subscribed
their affidavits, also declared that those two accused gave their statements
freely and voluntarily.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the accused-appellants were not informed of their
right to remain silent and to counsel will not render their extra-judicial
confessions inadmissible as the confessions were obtained in 1967, or prior to
the effectivity of the new Charter on January 17, 1973.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, the defense has not presented any evidence of
compulsion or duress nor violence on their persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They failed to complain to the swearing
officers (t.s.n., April 4, 1968, p. 48);<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
they did not institute any criminal or administrative action against their
alleged torturers for maltreatment (t.s.n., May 13, 1968, p. 349);<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span> they
showed no mark of violence in their bodies (t.s.n., July 31, 1968, p. 109);<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
neither did they have them­selves examined by a reputable physician to buttress
their claims.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Additionally, the fact that the accused, in their respective State­ments,
tended to exculpate themselves and instead pointed to Pabling (Bisaya) and
Jawali (Badjao) as their leaders but who are still at large, as the real
culprits (Exhibits K, N, P and R), is another factor indicating voluntariness.</p>

<blockquote>"Where the narration of the declarant tends to explain his con­duct
or shift the blame to others, this is a circumstance that may be considered as
demonstrative of voluntariness rather than of com­pulsion."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the extrajudicial confessions of the accused, having
been voluntarily given, are admissible in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commis­sion of the crime is corroborated
by evidence of the <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u>, particularly, the debris of
the PC patrol boat which were recovered, (Exhs. F and G), and by the statement
of Fiscal Montilla that <u>Tam­busong Mohamadsali</u> and Pangalawan Anodin
could point to the exact spot where the felony was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The element of death in the <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u>
and the criminal agency causing it have been estab­lished, besides the fact
that it may be proven circumstantially or presumptively.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respective Statements
of the accused (Exhibits C, D, E, K to R) are unanimous in that Pabling
(Bisaya) and Jawali (Badjao) were the leaders of the group and the actual
perpetrators of the criminal act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Typical of such a declaration is that of Pangalawan Anodin, one of their
companions in the same motorboat, who stated:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Q. 18<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>- <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened, after this?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
intercepted the PC sea patrol who was towing the 2 pump-boats and when we were
already near them, Pabling (Visaya) talked to the members of the PC sea
patrol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, Pabling
(Visaya) lighted a dynamite that he was holding, then stood up and threw it to
the PC Outboard Motor hitting the rear portion of same resulting to the death
of a civilian who was operating and one (1) soldier near him and destroying the
said portion of the Out-Board Motor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the throwing of dynamite by Pabling (Visaya) was immediately fol­lowed
by the two throws of Jawali (Badjao) of 2 dynamites wherein I did not see
anymore whether it hit the PC Out-Board Motor or not as I was already taking
cover inside our Out-Board Motor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
I again saw Pabling (Visaya) threw 2 dynamites and after this, I stood up and saw
the already blasted PC Out-Board Motor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That we went near and there I saw two (2) dead bodies, that of a civi­lian
and that of a soldier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Pabling
(Visaya) and Jawali (Badjao) tied a stone of a head size respect­ively to one
of the legs of each dead body and dumped them into the sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this, we left for Piapi, Davao
City." (Exhibit L)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Further, that Pabling (Bisaya) and Jawali (Badjao) were actually
the ones who disposed of the bodies of the victims is corro­borated by <u>Tambusong
Mohamadsali</u> in his Statement (Exh. C), when he stated:</p>

<blockquote>Q.
13<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
killing the two PC soldiers and their civilian companion, what did you do to
them?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
killing them with dynamite blasts, Pabling (Visaya) picked up the dead bodies
of one PC and the civilian from the PC motor boat with the help of his
companions in their group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The body of
the other PC soldier was thrown out after the blasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pabling (Visaya) tied a big stone in the feet
of the PC soldier whose body was found on board and also the civilian com­panion
with big stone tied in his feet and dropped them to the sea and both were
sunk." (Exh. C)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The statements of <u>Jayri Jamari</u>, Madai Santalani, Pangala­wan
Anodin, Mantolgawi Tolawi and Sapal Jabal are to the same effect (Exhs. D, K,
L, M and O).</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial question to determine is whether, on the part of the
accused-appellants, as found by the trial Court, there was "concert of
action with the leaders of the group who blasted the said PC soldiers and
thereby proved the existence of conspiracy among them."</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule affirmatively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
no previous agreement to commit the crime was evidently proven, the existence
of a conspir­acy may be inferred from the acts of appellants tending to show a
community of criminal purpose or design.</p>

<blockquote>"The agreement of which the law speaks is not limited to one
which is written or otherwise expressly or direct­ly made prior to the
commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
necessary that the malefactors, for an appreciable time prior to the commission
of the crime, had actually come together and agreed in terms to pursue a common
design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For conspiracy to exist, it is
enough that the participants had the same pur­pose and were united in its
execution, as may be inferred from the attendant circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To establish conspir­acy, it is not necessary
to prove pre­vious agreement to commit a crime if there be proof that the
malefactors have acted in concert and in pursuance of the objectives.
Conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such
point to a joint purpose and design.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their action must be judged not by what they say, for what men do is the
best index of their intention."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That the accused-appellants were animated by the same purpose and
were united in the execution of the criminal act may be deduced from their own
Statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By their respective ad­missions,
accused-appellants stated in their Affidavits that they actually participated
in the throwing of dynamite at the PC motor­boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote <u>Tambutso Patuhin</u>:</p>

<blockquote>"Q. 7<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
is your participation in this killing incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
<u>I have thrown (1) dynamite</u> to the already blasted PC Outboard Motor per
order of Pabling (Visaya) but it did not hit the said Outboard Motor."

<blockquote>"Q. 11 -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will you please relate how the incident took place?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x After throwing their dynamites, the men in the third banca shouted at us
riding in the two bancas being towed that we must also throw our dynamites at
the PC motorboat or else they would blast us also with dynamites and so <u>we
also threw dynamites</u> at the PC motorboat." (Exh. C)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, <u>Samindi Cosing</u> admitted his participation in
the dynamite throwing in his Affidavit, partly quoted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>20 -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who threw dynamites at them?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>I
threw dynamite</u> but it did not hit the PC." (Exh. E)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In so far as <u>Jayri Jamari</u> is concerned, the incriminating
evidence is clear from the answer he gave to the following question.</p>

<blockquote>"Q.
8<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Samindi
Cosing and Tambusong Mohamadsali declared that you with the rest of your companions
in another banca that was also apprehended by the same PC patrol to include
that other banca which intercepted the PC while you were being towed <u>killed
the PC soldiers by blasting them with dynamites</u>, is this also true?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- <span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
is true, sir." (Exh. D) (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact that accused-appellants directly participated in
dynamiting the PC motorboat was corroborated by Sapal Jabal who was in the same
ATTACKING BOAT as the leaders, Pabling (Bis ya) and Jawali (Badjao), thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.
26 <span style="">&nbsp;</span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aside
from your group of seven men, do you recall if any on board the two Pump-Boat
had also thrown dynamites to the PC OutBoard Motor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first Pump-Boat I saw <u>Tambutso
Patuhin throw the dynamite once</u> but it did not reach the PC Outboard Motor
and in the other Pump-Boat I saw <u>Samindi Cosing throw one</u> but it did not
also hit the PC Outboard Motor." (Exh. O) (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mastalbari Pawaki corroborated that fact when he said in his
Affidavit:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.
21 -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While you were already towed by
the PC sea-patrol towards the direction of Davao City, what happened, if any?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x I also saw Jawali (Badjao), <u>Tambutso Patuhin</u> and <u>Samindi Cosing
throw dynamite to the banca</u> where the two (2) soldiers and one (1) civilian
rode on." (Exh. Q) (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Abubakar Aplasi's declaration was in the same vein:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.
7<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aside
from Pabling and Jawali, who else of your companions you also saw threw
dynamites to the PC Outboard Motor?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Affidavits of Pangalawan Anodin and Madai Santalani were to
the same effect (Exhs. L-3 and K-3, respectively).</p>

<p class="BODY">Although they admittedly hurled dynamite, the accused-appellants
tried to exculpate themselves from criminal liability by interposing the
defense that they did so only in obedience to the command of their leaders and
under "compulsion of an irresistible force or under the impulse of an
uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater injury," that of being dynamited
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find such defense
a valid one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In some early cases, it has
been held:</p>

<blockquote>"A threat, in order to induce insu­perable fear, must promise
such grave results, and such results must be so imminent, that the common run
of men would succumb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime
threatened must be greater than, or at least equal to, that which we are
compelled to commit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x before a force can be considered to be an irresistible
one, it must produce such an effect upon the individual that, in spite of all
resistance, it reduces him to a mere instrument and, as such, it compels his
members to act and his mind to obey."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Duress as a valid defense should be based on reasonable fear
of a real and imminent danger to one's life or limb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not consist of specula­tive, fanciful,
or remote fear."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the command was, in fact, given, and the threat
made, the fear engendered thereby was more fanciful and remote rather than
real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, it is doubtful that
the leaders Pabling (Bisaya) and Jawali (Badjao) would have made good their
threat considering that they themselves were nego­tiating for the release of
the entire group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another, they all
had a common cause against the PC, then a common enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is more logical to conclude, therefore,
that accused-appellants hurled dynamite because they were motivated by a common
senti­ment, that of escaping the clutches of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention that when they did so the PC
motorboat had already been blasted and the victims dead so that the situation
would not have been al­tered, is hardly plausible under the circumstances
surrounding the incident and has not been sufficiently established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, for conspiracy to exist,
participation in every detail of execution is not indispensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there is "a closeness of personal
association and a concurrence of sentiments," as in this case,
"conspiracy may be inferred."</p>

<blockquote>"Conspiracy implies concert of design and not participation in
every detail of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is proved
that two or more persons aimed, by their acts, at the accomplishment of some
unlawful object, each doing a part so that their acts, though appa­rently
independent, were in fact con­nected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of
personal association and a concurrence of sentiments, conspir­acy may be
inferred although no actual meeting between them to conspire is proved, for the
prosecution need not establish that all the parties thereto agreed to every
detail in the execution of the crime or that they were actually together at all
stages of the conspiracy."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy having been established, the act of one is the act of
all.</p>

<blockquote>"Everyone of the conspirators who took active part in its
execution, is therefore responsible for all of the acts of the others in
furtherance of the com­mon design."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of the crime
committed is Murder because of the presence of the qualifying circumstance of
having been com­mitted by means of explosion (Art. 248(3), Revised Penal Code).</p>

<blockquote>"A person who threw a hand grenade at his victim who was
killed as a result of the explosion is guilty of murder."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a> </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is complexed with the crime of Direct Assault upon Agents of
Persons in Authority as it has been proven that the two PC enlisted men were
engaged in the performance of their official duties at the time they were
attacked by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, when a single act
constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, the penalty for the most
serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be applied in its maximum
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty prescribed for
Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code is <u>reclusion temporal</u>
in its maximum period to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
imposable penalty therefore, is death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being a single indivisible penalty, it has to be applied regardless of
any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the
commission of the deed.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a> However, in view of the dissent of
Justice Ramon C. Aquino, concurred in by Justice Antonio P. Barredo, the
required number of votes for the imposition of the capital punishment has not
been obtained and, therefore, the penalty to be imposed is the next lower in
degree, or <u>reclusion perpetua</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In so far as <u>Samindi Cosing</u> is concerned, considering his
minority, the penalty one degree lower, or <u>reclusion perpetua</u>, has been
correctly imposed (Art. 68(2) in relation to Art. 61(1), Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment of the trial Court is hereby
modified in that <u>Tambutso Patuhin</u>, <u>Jayri Jamari</u> and <u>Tambusong<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mohamadsali</u> shall suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion
perpetua</u>, and the amount of indemnity to be paid to the heirs of each of
the deceased is hereby raised from P10,000.00 to P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">With proportionate costs against the accused-appellants.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the holding that the four accused-appellants are
criminally liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they should be
convicted of three separate offenses because there were three victims who were
killed by means of separate acts and not by a single act.</p>

<p class="BODY">They are guilty of <u>two separate</u> complex crimes of murder
with <u>atentado</u> as to the two Constabulary sergeants and of simple murder
as to the dead civilian.</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent as to the imposition of the death penalty on the three
accused because they were not the leaders of the assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two leaders, Pabling Bisaya and Jawali
Badjao, are at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs.
Cabrera, 43 Phil. 64 and 82; People vs. Sakam, 61 Phil. 27, 35; People vs.
Moreno, L-37801-05, October 23, 1978, 85 SCRA 649; People vs. John Doe, L-2463,
March 31, 1950.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the fact that the accused are non-Christians should be
taken into account (Sec. 106, Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu; People
vs. Main, 51 Phil. 933; People vs. Mori, L-23511 and L-23512, January 31, 1974,
55 SCRA 382, 404).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the three accused, who were sentenced to death, should
each be sentenced to three <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetuas</u>, subject to the
forty-year limit.</p>
