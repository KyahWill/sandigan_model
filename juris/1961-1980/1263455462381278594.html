				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by the Solicitor General from the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> granting the
petition of TAN KHE SHING alias TAN KEE SING to be admitted as citizen of the
Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, a citizen of the Republic of China was born
August 31, 1925 in <span class="SpellE">Fukien</span>, China.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arrived to the port of Manila on November
19, 1929, on board the vest SS SUSANA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was in Manila for one week, then proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Mogpog</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>, where he stayed for another week and
finally went to <span class="SpellE">Boac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>,
where he established his legal residence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He finished his primary grades at the primary school in <span class="SpellE">Boac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>, his elementary
grade, at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Republican</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and his high school course
at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Anglo-Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, where he lived for a
period of two to three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1950" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1950</st1:date>, in City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
he contracted marriage with So <span class="SpellE">Moy</span> Hun, another
Chinese, with whom he has six children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three of these children who were of school age at the time of the
hearing of the petition, namely, Antonio, Alfredo, and Webster, were enrolled
and studying at the Crusader's Academy located a <st1:street><st1:address>649 <span class="SpellE">Ongpin</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has a general merchandise store at the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Boac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>, with a working capital of P30,000.00 and from
which he derived an annual income of from P6,000.00 to P7,000.00 in the years
1960 and 1961, and more or less P9,000.00 in the year 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two witnesses, Ex-Governor Miguel <span class="SpellE">Manguerra</span>
and Ex-Mayor Jose M. Madrigal, both residents of <span class="SpellE">Boac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> vouched for petitioner's good moral
character and irreproachable conduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the Solicitor General alleges that the Court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in not finding
that the petition a has not evinced a sincere desire to embrace Filipino
customs and traditions; and (2) in not finding that petitioner has not
conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner by his continuous use
of an alias without judicial authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assigned error, the Solicitor General
points out in his brief:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> All the
children of the petitioner who are of school age are now presently enrolled and
studying at the Crusader's Academy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that said school is recognized by the government and is
a branch of the San Juan de <span class="SpellE">Letran</span> College, it cannot
also be denied that most of the students in said school are the children of
Chinese nationals the same being located in the center of the teeming Chinese
district of <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the inference of the Solicitor General may be correct,
there is nothing in the record to show that the students in the Crusader's
Academy are predominantly children of Chinese nationals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if there had been a showing to that
effect the enrollment of petitioner's children in said school, would adversely
reflect in his sincerity to embrace Filipino Customs and traditions.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot therefore, rule that the trial
court erred on this particular point.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second assigned error, petitioner admits that in
almost all the documentary evidences presented by him the name TAN KHE SHING
alias TAN KEE SING appears; but contends that this fact does not constitute a
violation of law which may disqualify him from acquiring Filipino citizenship
because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) his use of the alias TAN
KEE SING is one of the exceptions provided for Section 1 of Commonwealth Act
142, petitioner having used alias since childhood when he entered the public schools;
and (2) that he has only one "name”, which name been spelled in two
different ways, to wit: TAN KEE SHING and KEE SING.</p>

<p class="BODY">On direct examination petitioner tried to explain the use of the
alias TAN KEE SING by stating that when he was enrolled in the primary school,
his teacher misspelled his name and from that time on he has adopted the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, except for petitioner's
own testimony no other evidence was introduced to show that in the primary
grades he was using and/or was known by the name TAN KEE SING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as no corroborative evidence was
adduced to show the veracity of his assertion, petitioner's contention cannot
be sustained on the first ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the second ground relied upon by the petitioner, TAN
KEE SING cannot be considered as just another way of spelling TAN KHE
SHING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a different name al­together,
an alias in contemplation of law, since "the dif­ference of one letter in
a name may mean the distinction of identity of one person with that of
another" (Tan vs. Republic G. R. No. L-16384, <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1962</st1:date>; Khan vs. Republic, G. R. No.
L-19709, <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="9">Sept. 30, 1964</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view thereof, we find that the petitioner has used the alias
TAN KEE SING in violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142, a ground sufficient to
warrant the denial of a petition for naturalization.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as "this case is open for review in its entirety by
this Court regardless of whether or not objection had been made in connection
with a particular point during the proceedings below" (Go In <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> vs. Republic, G. R. L-17919 July 30, 1966; <span class="SpellE">Kwock</span> How vs. Republic, G. R. L-18521, Jan. 30, 1964; <span class="SpellE">Tio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Chai</span>
vs. Republic, G. R. L-19112, Oct. 30 1964), we note that the petition of
applicant is fatally deprive on at least two more points:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the notice and publication requirements
of the law were not complied with; and the petition failed to state applicant's
former place of residence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other than the affidavit of the Director-Publisher of the
"NUEVA ERA" to the effect that said newspaper was general circulation
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there is no evidence that it was of general circulation in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.
In the case of Tan Ten <span class="SpellE">Kock</span> vs. Republic, G. R. No.
L-18344, <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1964</st1:date>
and reiterated in the case of Tan <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> vs. Republic,
G. R. No. L-23181, <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="10">Oct. 24, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The law requires that the newspaper in which the petition for
naturalization is to be published must be of general circulation in the
province where peti­tioner resides.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While, in the instant case, there is an affidavit executed by the Editor
of the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era to the effect that the said
newspaper is of general circulation in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
this statement is not sufficient proof that there has been compliance with the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Positive evidence must be presented
to prove that the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era is of general circulation
in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, and it is incumbent,
upon petitioner to present such evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The purpose of the law in requiring publication of the notice is
to inform those officers and the public in general of the filing of such a
petition in order that the public officers and private citizens supposed to be
acquainted with the petitioner may furnish the Solicitor General or the
provincial fiscal with such necessary information and evidence as there may be
against the petitioner (Anti-Chinese League of the Phil. vs. Alfonso Felix,
etc., et al., G. R. No. L-998, <st1:date year="1947" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1947</st1:date>, 77 Phil. 1012).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering then that the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Era is
published in Spanish and not in English or in the dialect of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, which are more commonly used in petitioner's
province of residence, and that there has been no positive and direct proof
that it is generally circulated in said pro­vince, the publication made therein
may not be taken as having served the objective of the law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the second point, the petitioner on cross?examination
stated that he stayed at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Anglo-Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>, which is located in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
from two to three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, his
petition does not state that he resided in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
at any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that such
failure to mention petitioner's former residences affects the jurisdiction of
the court to hear the case" (O Ku <span class="SpellE">Phuan</span> vs.
Republic, G.R. No. L-23406, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="8">August 31,
 1967</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court had
occasion to explain this point, thus:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
a petition for naturalization, petitioner should set forth not only his present
place of residence but also his "former places of residence."
(Section 7, Revised Naturalization Law) The statement of all the places of
residence, past and present, is required to inform the gen­eral public and to
enable it to register its protest through the administrative agencies of the
Government, if warranted, against petitioner's desire to embrace
citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For petitioner to omit some
of his previous residences is to withhold full opportunity for intelligent
objection and virtually to defeat the purpose of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lo vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-15919, <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1961</st1:date>; Qua vs. Republic, G. R.
L-19834, <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1964</st1:date>;
Go vs. Republic, G. R. L-20558, <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1965</st1:date>; Tan vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-22207, Nay 30, 1966).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nor would petitioner be right by his contention that the provision
of section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law refers merely to legal residence
and not to physical or actual residence as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in mind the purpose of the law, which
is to accord a fair op­portunity for protest against naturalization by those
who know the applicant, it is not difficult to see that actual or physical
residence merits the same importance, if not indeed more, as legal
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in whatever place the
applicant establishes his actual residence, there he evinces his conduct and
exhibits his acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people around him
or those with whom he mingles, acquire an intimate knowledge of his ge­nuine
personality become better judges of his fitness for citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, legal residence could be the
place where the applicant seldom stays.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a gauge of his real self, information yielded by the legal residence
could be illusory, for the people in such place may gain but a superficial
knowledge of the subjects conduct and activities, which could be just an
inkling of a few of the many facets of his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considerations such as these have impelled
this Court to underscore the importance of alleging the actual or physical
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>” (Chua Eng Go vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-21054, <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1967</st1:date>).</blockquote>
