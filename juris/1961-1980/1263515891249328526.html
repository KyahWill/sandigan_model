				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original action for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners Gil V. <span class="SpellE">Maribao</span>
and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanillo-Maribao</span>
- hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> - pray that
certain orders issued by Hon. <span class="SpellE">Numeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>, as Judge of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
in Sp. Civil Case No. 711-0 of said court, be annulled and that he be declared
to be without jurisdiction to try said case, as well as "immediately en­joined
from proceeding further with the case."</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that, on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1">January
 25, 1965</st1:date>, the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:place></st1:city>
instituted said Case No. 711-0 for the expropriation of several tracts of land
located within its territorial boundaries, to be used as "<st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:place><st1:placename>Government</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place></st1:place>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the defendants therein - altogether 31
in number - were pe­titioners herein, as owners of some of the lots sought to
be expropriated. In its complaint, the City prayed, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, for an order fixing the sum of P50,000 as the
provisional value of all the properties involved in the case and directing the
defendants to deliver immediately the possession of said properties to the
City, upon the deposit of said sum with its treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 3, 1965, judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> issued an order fixing said provisional value at
P50,000, and, a certification by said Treasurer, to the effect that this amount
is provided for in the current annual budget of the City and is available for
expenditure, having been forthwith submitted, Judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>
ordered, on the same date, the issuance of the corresponding writ of
possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants other than the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span>
filed motions to dismiss, which Judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> denied
in an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order, moreover, declared that the City
has the lawful right to expropriate the aforementioned properties, upon payment
of just compensation, and appointed the City and Highway Engineer, the City
assessor and the Assistant City Auditor as Commissioners to ascertain amount of
said compensation and then report thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="3">March 27,
 1965</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> appointed a new set
of commissioners, composed of District Supervisor, and two (2) barrio captains.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, or on March 5, 1965, the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span>
filed a motion to set aside said orders of February 3 and 23, 1965, upon the
ground that the same were issued before the court had acquired jurisdiction
over their persons by service of summons, which took place on February 23,
1965, and another motion to dismiss the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These motions were denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> on <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="3">March
 13, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> filed three (3) motions for reconsideration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one, dated April 15, 1965, as regards the
denial of the motion to set aside the orders of February 3 and 23, 1965;
another, dated April 17, 1965, with respect to the denial of the motion to
dismiss; and still another, dated April 19, 1965, urging the appointment, in
lieu of the commissioners appointed in the order of March 21, 1965, of a
commissioner to represent the plaintiff, another commissioner to represent the
defendants, and a third commissioner to represent the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These three (3) motions for reconsideration
were denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile the commissioners had begun to perform their functions
and to receive evidence, after which they submit­ted their report, copy of
which was received by the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1965</st1:date>, recommending payment
of P0.29 to P0.30 per square meter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under date of <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1965</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> filed their opposition to said report,
alleging that they had no chance to present evidence as regards the value of
their property and the commissioners had not duly considered actual sales of
portions of the land sought to be expropriated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1965</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> rendered his decision fixing the value
of the properties in litigation at P0.30 a square meter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this decision was, on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1965</st1:date>, served on the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span>, who, on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="7">July
 17, 1965</st1:date>, moved for a reconsideration thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration was denied on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four (4) days later, the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span>
filed a motion for new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July
 23, 1965</st1:date>, they had commenced the present original civil action for
certiorari, based, mainly, upon the theory that Judge <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>
had acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack of jurisdiction:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In giving due course to the complaint in said
Case No. 711-0, despite the absence of allegation that the President or the
proper department head had approved or authorized the exercise of the right of
eminent domain by the City;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In issuing the writ of possession and
appointing commissioners to ascertain the value of the properties sought to be
expropriated, before the court had acquired jurisdiction over the person of
said defendants by the service of summons upon them, and before their motion to
dismiss had been denied;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In not requiring the City to deposit
"money" be­fore the issuance of said writ of possession;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In denying their motion to set aside the
orders of February 3 and 23, 1965, as well as the motion to reconsider the
order of denial of said motion to set aside;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In appointing as commissioners city officers
who are, consequently, biased and incompetent, and who gave the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> no chance to present their evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition herein is clearly devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged absence of presidential or
departmental approval of the exercise by the City of the power of eminent
domain - assuming such approval to be necessary, on which we need not and do
not express our view - did not affect the jurisdiction of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same unquestionably had jurisdiction over
the subject-matter of the proceedings, over the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span>
- who, admittedly, had been duly served with summons - and over the properties
sought to be expropriated, which are within the Province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the assumption above referred to, the
absence of said approval, at most, affected the <u>cause of action</u> of the
City, not the <u>jurisdiction</u> of the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither did the other alleged irregularities complained of by the
<span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> divest said court of its aforementioned
jurisdiction or constitute a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said alleged
irregularities are mere incidents in the exercise of said jurisdiction, on
which the parties are free to disagree with the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may seek a review of its rulings
thereon, but, on appeal, after the rendition of final judgment, not by original
action of certiorari, which may not be availed of except in the absence of
appeal or other plain speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE">Ma­ribaos</span> could have availed
of said appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, some of, their
co-defendants in Case No. 711-0 have appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic flaw in the position taken by the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span>
is that it is predicated upon the erroneous premise that the lower court had no
jurisdiction to entertain, hear and decide the case, because the City had not
secured the approval thereto of either the President or the proper department
se­cretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the issues raised by
the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> in the lower court were founded mainly
upon this mistaken notion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such was the
basis of their motion to dismiss and their mo­tion for reconsideration of the
order denying said motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grounds upon which their other motions were based were
foreign to the matter of jurisdiction of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is true even as regards the orders issued
before the <span class="SpellE">Maribaos</span> had been summoned, for, after
service of summons upon them, they had ample opportunity to be heard, and were
actually heard, in connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the irregularities complained of may not be dealt with in this
original action for certiorari.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The review thereof may be sought only by appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
