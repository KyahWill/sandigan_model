				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Defeated in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>,
Province of Iloilo, and again thwarted by the Court of First Instance of
Iloilo, plaintiffs, in their appeal <u>in</u> <u>forma</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pauperis</u></span>,
seek the reversal of the last named court's order dismissing their complaint
which prays that they be awarded damages for the seizure and public auction
sale of a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> which they claim to be theirs but
for which they hold an admittedly falsified certificate of ownership of large
cattle not in their name but in the name of one <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1962</st1:date>,
defendant chief of police seized from plaintiffs a male <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>,
eight years old, with municipal and owner's brands of CB and M,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also seized was covering
Certificate of Ownership of Large Cattle No. 3180194 issued on <st1:date year="1957" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1957</st1:date> in the name of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This seizure concededly was made upon the
authority of a municipal ordinance of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
enacted in <span class="GramE">pursuance</span> of Sections 538 and 540 of the
Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1962</st1:date>, defendant municipal
treasurer caused to be sold at public auction the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
for P285 to one Elias <span class="SpellE">Gallar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That sale was later approved by the Provincial
Board of Iloilo.<br></p><p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs aver that
they acquired the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in question sometime in
1959 from <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>
in exchange for an old <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ownership Certificate 3180194 heretofore
mentioned was turned over to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
this ownership certificate is falsi­fied is beyond debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, the lower court's finding not
disputed but on the contrary admitted by plaintiffs is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"To resolve whether the plaintiff
acquired the ownership of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in question, we
examined plaintiff's Exhibit A [Certificate of Ownership of Large Cattle
3180194 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>]
and we found therein erasures which can be clearly seen with a naked eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span> after the phrase – '<span class="GramE">This</span>
certificate <span class="SpellE">witnesseth</span> that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>' - has been written over an erasure of the
said space and so with the signature of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span> over the lines 'signature of owner' [which] is
also written over an erasure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also,
after the phrase 'brand of owner' the mark there M is also over an
erasure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We noted that all these
superimposed writings are written in a different indelible pencil and
distinctly different from the other writings in Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also at the back of said Exhibit A, we
noticed erasures which could clearly be seen on both figures of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> repre­senting their cowlicks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These erasures clearly show that this
certificate was altered and falsified."<br>

</p><p class="BODY">The original of the said Certificate of Ownership of Large Cattle
3180194, Exhibit B, on file with the office of the municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, conclusively proves the fact that the copy
thereof seized from plaintiffs' possession was falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that Exhibit B, it appears that the owner
was <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Torquemada</span>, not
<span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>; that
the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> described therein was one and one-half
years old and the brand owner is H, contrary to what appears in plaintiffs'
document, Exhibit A, which says that the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was
three years old and the brand of the owner M.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the <span class="GramE">description of the cowlicks of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in Exhibit B are</span> different from those found
at the back of Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, there is the fact that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Armentia</span> filed a complaint for falsification of
public document against <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>
for having falsified said Certificate of Ownership of Large Cattle 3180194.</p>

2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear then
that the sole question that presents - <span class="GramE">itself</span> is
whether or not, on the face of the foregoing facts, the seizure and public
auction of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> by the local officials of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span> give plaintiffs a cause to complain for damages.<br>

<p class="BODY">The question here presented is by no means new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Tobias</u> (1968), 23 SCRA 928, was decided by this Court on facts
strikingly similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants now
before us were also defendants in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a seizure of a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> which was in the possession of therein plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Landa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, as here, the date of the seizure is <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The date of the auction sale is likewise the
same - <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Landa's</span> proof of
ownership of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was a certificate that was
also falsi­fied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise issued
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>,
the same name appearing in the certificate of ownership possessed by plaintiffs
herein, the <span class="SpellE">Armentias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span>,
the registered owner appearing on the certificate on file in the municipal
treasurer's office was also different - a certain <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elvas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
arguments posited in <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span> are along the same
lines as the arguments presented by plaintiffs here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span>,
the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissed plaintiff's complaint for
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need but reproduce <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>haec</u></span>
<u>verb</u> the pertinent portions of our decision in the <span class="SpellE">Landa</span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Speaking thru Mr. Chief Justice
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, we there said:</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff maintains that the lower court erred in holding
that he had no title to the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, for
non-compliance, on his part, with the provisions of the Revised Administrative
Code, requiring the registration of cattle, prescribing the procedure for the
transfer thereof, regulating amendments to certificates of ownership, and
establishing the necessity of registration and issuance of a certificate of
transfer in order that the same may be valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He invokes the provision of the Civil Code, governing contracts in
general, to the effect that 'contracts shall be obligatory in whatever form
they may have been entered into provided all essential requisites for their
validity are present.' In addition, to the essential requisites specified in
the Civil Code, the Revised Administrative Code prescribes, however, another
requisite, as regards the transfer of title to the cattle, namely, the registration
of said transfer and the issuance to the transferee of the corresponding
certificate of transfer, neither of which has been proven in the case at bar.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Although plaintiff claimed to have the
aforementioned certificate of transfer, but he did not produce the same.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, plaintiff could not possibly have
such certificate, for the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was allegedly
conveyed to him by <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>,
whereas the registered owner is <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Elvas</span> - and plaintiff knew this fact - and there is no
competent proof that <span class="SpellE">Elvas</span> had ever assigned the
animal to <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the complaint for swindling filed against <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>
indicates that the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> did not belong to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of the aforementioned
provisions of the Revised Administrative Code, the title to the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> could not have passed, therefore, to <span class="SpellE">Landa</span>, in consequence of his alleged transaction with <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>, who had no such title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss to note that <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span> might be no more than a figment of the
imagination, for he has neither taken the witness stand nor been found."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After we described the alterations on the certificate of ownership
presented by <span class="SpellE">Landa</span>, we ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"Under these circumstances, it is clear that the policemen had
reasonable grounds to suspect that plaintiff's possession of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was unlawful, as well as to seize the animal and
deliver the same to the municipal treasurer, as provided in Section 538 of the
Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
thereto and to Section 540 of the same Code, said municipal treasurer had, not
only the authority, but, also, the 'duty' to issue, post and cause to be served
a notice of the seizure or taking of said animal, and, if the owners thereof
'fail to <u>present</u> <u>themselves</u> within the time specified in the
notice and <u>prove</u> <u>title</u> to the animals taken or seized as
aforesaid,' notice of such fact shall be given by said officer to the provincial
board, 'which shall order said animals to be sold at public auction,' after
giving the notice prescribed in said legal provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 'purchaser at such sale shall' - in the
language of Section 540 - 'receive a good and indefeasible title to the animal
sold.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even if plaintiff were hypothetically the true owner of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in question, his only remedy was, accordingly, to
claim it before the municipal treasurer and prove to the latter his
(plaintiff's) title thereto, either prior to or at the time of the auction
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not having done so, plaintiff can
not now make such claim judicially and try to prove his title - which, after
all, he has failed to establish - much less seek indemnity from the public officers
who, by reason of their official duties, had a hand in the seizure and sale of
the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering the stipulation of the parties herein, to the effect
that said sale had been '<u>duly</u> approved by the Provincial Board,' apart
from the legal presumption 'that official duty has been regularly performed' we
must assume that defendants herein had complied with the requirements of the
legal provisions above referred to, and, conse­quently, they can not be held
liable for the aforesaid seizure and sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiff further alleges that the lower court erred in not
declaring that the public auction of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in
question as 'astray' is against the law, because the animal was taken or seized
from him, not found <u>astray</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
pretense is groundless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not borne
out by paragraph 3 of the partial stipulation of facts cited by him in support
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale at public auction was
held pursuant to the aforementioned Section 540, captioned 'Sale of unclaimed'
- not astray - 'animal,' although referring to 'all <span class="SpellE"><u>estray</u></span>
and all animals recovered from thieves or <u>taken</u> by peace officers from
persons unlawfully or reasonably suspected of being unlawfully in possession of
the same' - which are the subject-matter of Section 538 - the owners of which
'fail to present themselves within the time fixed in the notice and prove title
to the animals <u>taken</u> or <u>seized</u> as aforesaid.' Such is precisely,
the situation obtaining in the case at bar."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No reason exists why we should break away from the <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span> pronouncements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not to lose sight of the purpose of the
legal provisions requiring the branding and registration of ownership of large
cattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as 1910, we have said
in <u>U.S.</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Toribio</u></span>, 15 Phil.
85, 89, that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Act primarily
seeks to protect the 'large cattle' of the Philippine Islands against theft and
to make easy the recovery and return of such cattle to their proper owners,
when lost, strayed, or stolen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this
end it provides an elaborate and compulsory system for the separate branding
and registry of ownership of all such cattle throughout the Islands, whereby
owners are enabled readily and easily to establish their title; it prohibits
and invalidates all transfers of large cattle unaccompanied by certificates of
transfer issued by the proper officer in the municipality where the contract of
sale is made; and it provides also for the disposition of <span class="SpellE">estrays</span>
and animals recovered from the possession of thieves or persons unlawfully in
possession, so as to protect the rights of the true owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">All this, manifestly, in
order to make it difficult for any one but the rightful owner of such cattle to
retain them in his possession or to dispose of them to others."</span></p>

3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question
in our mind that upon the provisions of Section 538 of the Revised
Administrative Code, the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in dispute was
lawfully seized by defendant chief of police from plaintiffs who were
"unlawfully or reasonably suspected of being unlawfully in the
possession" thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor should
there be any quibbling as to the right of defendant municipal treasurer to
dispose of said <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> pursuant to Section 540 of
the Revised Administrative Code, as we have ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Tobias</u>. For, the certificate of ownership there presented in
the first place is falsified on its face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To be stressed at this point are the provisions of Section 527 of the
Revised Administrative Code, thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Erasures, interlineations, or amendments in certificates of
registry or transfer shall be presumed to be invalid unless noted over the
signature of the official or persons issuing or executing the same." Appro­priate
it is to state that the alterations superimposing the name of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span> on the
certificate in question do not bear the signatures required in Section 527
aforesaid. 'Those alterations, therefore, are invalid, no evidence to the
contrary having been adduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
thus hard put to conclude that <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span> is the legal owner of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being the owner, he had nothing to
transfer to plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as we have
observed in <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span>, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Armentia's</span> complaint
against <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>
for falsification of public document "indicates that the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> did not belong to him."<br>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, there is Section 529, Revised Administrative Code,
which stands in plaintiffs' way. It states that "[n]o transfer of large
cattle shall be valid unless the same is registered and a certificate of
transfer obtained as herein provided." Gauged by this requirement, the
transfer to the <span class="SpellE">Armentias</span> of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
cannot be valid and, in the words of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Veloso</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Becerra</u>, 34 Phil. 334, 335, "conveyed no title" to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, such transfer is not
registered; and they did not obtain a certificate of transfer in their names or
in that of either of them.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the circumstances, of course, this transfer could not have been
possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because no legal transfer from
the registered owner, <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Torquemada</span>,
to <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span> or
to plaintiffs, for that matter, was proved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, as was ruled in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Landa</u></span>
decision, plaintiffs' remedy was to claim the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
before the municipal treasurer and prove their title thereto, prior to or at
the time of the auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Which they did not.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We thus conclude that the <span class="SpellE">Armentias</span>
have not duly established their ownership to the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>;
and that it was only in pursuance of a legal duty that defendant local
officials seized the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and caused it to be
sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may not be held liable for
damages to plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE REASONS GIVEN</b>, the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1964</st1:date> dismissing
