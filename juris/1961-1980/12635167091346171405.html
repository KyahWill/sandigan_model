				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Plaintiffs Manuela S. <span class="SpellE">Formento</span> and
Rodolfo L. <span class="SpellE">Formento</span> seek the review of a decision of
the Court of Appeals reversing that of the Court of First Instance of Manila
and absolving the defendants from plaintiffs' complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Late in 1962, defendant <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Guariño</span> was accused, in Criminal Case No. 67117 of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, of damage to property and less serious
physical injuries through reckless negligence, in that, being the driver of JD
passenger bus bearing plate No. PUB-154 <span class="SpellE">Mla</span>. '62,
which was owned and operated by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Heras</span>, on
September 5, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Guariño</span> drove said bus so
recklessly and imprudently that the vehicle hit and bumped a motor­cycle driven
by plaintiff, Rodolfo L. <span class="SpellE">Formento</span>, with his co-plaintiff
and wife, Manuela S. <span class="SpellE">Formento</span>, as a backseat rider,
in consequence of which both sustained less serious physical injuries and the
motor­cycle was damaged in the total sum of P163.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having pleaded guilty to the charge, upon
arraignment, on January 28, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Guariño</span> was
forthwith sentenced to one (1) month and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> and to indemnify the offended parties in the sum of <span style="">P</span>163 - represent­ing the amount of the
damage caused to the motorcycle - with subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 29, 1963, plaintiffs commenced the present civil action,
against <span class="SpellE">Heras</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guariño</span>,
for damages allegedly sustained by the former by reason of said negligence of <span class="SpellE">Guariño</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that plaintiffs'
cause of action is barred by the decision in the criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court deferred action on the motion to
dismiss and directed the defendants to answer the complaint, whereas the
defendants filed a third party complaint, against <span class="SpellE">Fieldmen's</span>
Insurance Co., on a common carrier's accident insurance policy covering the bus
in­volved in the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants,
likewise, filed their answer, admitting that the JD transit belongs to <span class="SpellE">Heras</span> and that <span class="SpellE">Guariño</span> was
driving the bus aforementioned, but denied the other averments of the
complaint, and pleaded <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>,
based upon the judg­ment in the criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, in its answer to the
third party complaint, the insurance company admitted its third party liability
under said insurance policy and adopted, by reference, the defenses set up by
the defendants against plaintiffs' complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course thereafter, the Court of First Instance of Manila
rendered judgment for the plaintiffs, sentencing <span class="SpellE">Heras</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Guarino</span>, jointly and severally, to pay to the
plaintiffs the sums of P464, as compensatory damages - for medical treatment,
transpor­tation in the course thereof and medicine - <span style="">P1, </span>000, as moral dam­ages, P500, as attorney's fees, all with
interest at the rate of six per centum (6%) per annum, from March 29, 1963,
until fully paid, and the costs of the suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It likewise sentenced the insurance com­pany to reimburse <span class="SpellE">Heras</span> the amounts he had been sentenced to pay to the
plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, taken by the
three (3) defendants, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the lower
court and ab­solved said defendants from the complaint, with costs against the
plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue before us is whether the present action is barred by
the decision in the criminal case, considering that plain­tiffs had not
reserved therein the right to recover damages in a separate proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants maintain the affirmative view for
the reason that their civil liability for said damages is deemed set­tled by
the decision in the criminal case, under the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, plaintiffs urge a negative answer, upon the ground
that their complaint in the present case seeks to enforce a liability arising,
not from a crime, but from a <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter theory is supported by our decision in De Leon
Brokerage Co. vs. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> in which,
speaking for this Court, then Associate Justice (later Chief Justice) Cesar <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> expressed himself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The court of origin and the appellate court <u>correctly
considered respondent's complaint to be based on a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that she suf­fered injuries
because of the carelessness and imprudence of petitioner's chauffeur, who was
driving the cargo truck TH-776 belonging to peti­tioner, which truck collided
with the passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> wherein she was
riding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since averment had been made of
the employer-employee rela­tionship and of the damages caused by the employee
on occasion of his function, <u>there is a clear state­ment of a right of
action under Article 2180 of the Civil Code.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The parity between that case and the one at bar becomes more
apparent when we consider that, in the former, we held that "what­ever
doubts remain as to the nature" of the action filed by the injured party
"are resolved by the prayer" that the employer and the employee
"be held <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable" - which is,
likewise, made in the complaint of plaintiffs herein - because the employer's
liability under the Revised Penal Code<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> is merely
subsidiary in nature, whereas that arising from a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
is <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> in character;<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> that in
both cases the criminal conviction of the employee was alleged in the civil
complaint, and this fact was considered <u>insufficient</u>, in the De Leon
Brokerage case, to detract from the nature of the cause of action set up in
said<span style=""> </span>pleading, as one based upon
a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>; and that, in both, the employer
clearly understood that such was the foundation of the lia­bility exacted by
the injured party, in as much as the former alleged that it had exercised due
diligence in the selection of, and exercise of supervision over, his employee,
a defense available under the Civil Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> but not
under the Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">The plea of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> set up by the defendants is anchored upon
Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1. - <u>Institution of criminal and civil actions</u>.
- When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for recovery of civil
liability arising from the offense charged is impliedly instituted with the
criminal action, unless the offended party expressly waives the civil action or
reserves his right to insti­tute it separately.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 2. - <u>Independent civil action</u>. - In the cases
provided for in Articles 31, 32, 33, 34 and 2177 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
an indepen­dent civil action entirely separate and distinct from the criminal
action, may be brought by the injured party during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the criminal case, pro­vided the right is reserved as required in the pre­ceding
section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such civil action shall proceed
in­dependently of the criminal prosecution, and shall require only a
preponderance of evidence. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These provisions are, however, <u>inapplicable</u> to the case at
bar, inasmuch as the former form part of the revised Rules of Court, which
became effective on <u>January 1, 1964</u>, and the present civil action was
commenced over nine (9) months prior the <span class="SpellE">reto</span>, or on <u>March
29, 1963</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in Reyes v. <span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Rosa,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> it was
held that, in view of Article 33 of the New Civil Code, which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"In cases of defamation, fraud, and <u>physical injuries</u>,
a civil action for damages, entirely se­parate and distinct from the criminal
action, may be brought by the injured party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such civil action shall proceed <u>independently</u> of the criminal
prose­cution, and shall require only a preponderance of evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">a civil complaint, filed in 1955, for the
recovery of damages arising from physical injuries inflicted and slander or
defamation committed by the defendants, was not barred by the judgment in the
criminal action against the latter for said acts, despite plaintiff's failure
to reserve, in said criminal action, the "right to institute a separate
civil action for damages." This view was reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Ortaliz</span>
v. Echarri<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a> involving another case of
physical injuries through neg­ligence committed by the driver of a motor
vehicle.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, owing to the policy set forth in the above-quoted Art.
33 of the Civil Code, it has been consistently held, not only that "the
responsibility arising from fault or negligence in <span class="SpellE">quasi­delicts</span>
is <u>entirely separate and distinct</u> from the civil liability aris­ing from
negligence under the Penal Code"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a>, but,
also, that - at least, in cases instituted before January 1, 1964 - the failure
to make, in the criminal action, the reservation required in said Rule, will
not bar a separate civil action for quasi <span class="SpellE">delict</span>,
provided that the injured party has not intervened "actually" or <u>actively</u>
in the prosecution of said criminal action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, in Parker v. Pan­lilio,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> we said:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
The failure, therefore, on the part of the petitioner to reserve her right to
institute the civil action in the criminal case cannot in any way be deemed as
a waiver on her part to institute a se­parate civil action against the
respondent company based on its contractual liability, or on <u>culpa</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>aqui­liana</u></span> under articles 1902 to 1910 of the Civil
Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It should be here emphasized that <u>these two actions are
separate and distinct and should not be confused one with the other</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the supposition that the one accused in
the criminal case is a driver, employee, or dependent of the respondent
company, the failure to reserve the right to institute a separate civil action
in the criminal case would <u>not</u> necessarily constitute a bar to the
institution of the civil action against said respondent, <u>for the cause of
action in one is different from that in the other</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are two <u>independent</u> actions
based on <u>distinct</u> causes of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This distinction is aptly stated in the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
case (<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>' vs. Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>,
73 Phil. 607).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court said: 'There
are two liabilities of <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>; first, the subsidiary
one because of the civil liability of the taxi driver arising from the latter's
<u>cri­minal</u> negligence; and, second, <span class="SpellE">Barredo's</span>
pri­mary liability <u>as an employer</u> under Article 1903.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The plaintiffs were free to choose which
course to take, and they preferred the second remedy.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so doing they were acting within their
rights' (pp. 614-615, id).</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'A distinction exists between the civil liability arising from a
crime and responsibility for <span class="SpellE"><u>cuasi</u>-<u>delitos</u></span>
or <u>culpa</u> <u>extra</u>-<u>contractual</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same neg­ligent act causing damages may
produce a civil liability arising from a crime under article 100 of the Revised
Penal Code, or create an action for <span class="SpellE"><u>cuasi­</u>-<u>delito</u></span>
or <u>culpa</u> <u>extra</u>-<u>contractual</u> under articles 1902-1910 of the
Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs were free to
choose which remedy to enforce' (<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> vs. Gar­cia
and <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>, 73 Phil. 607). "<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Azucena</span> v. Potenciano,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> the language used was:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court in <span class="SpellE">Dyogi</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, G.R. No. L-9623, <st1:date year="1957" day="22" month="1">Jan. 22, 1957</st1:date>, stated that Article 33 con­stitutes a
partial amendment of Rule 107.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Calo</span> vs. Peggy, G.R. No. L-10756, <st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1958</st1:date>, substantially the same situation
as the one now be­fore us was passed upon by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A minor son of the defendant there, while
driving a jeep belonging to the father, bumped and injured plaintiff Romeo <span class="SpellE">Calo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A criminal
action for serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence was
instituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it was pending a civil
action to recover damages on the theory of quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
was filed against the father of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a judgment of acquittal was rendered, where it was intimated that
the victim of the accident was the one at fault, the defendant in the civil
action moved for its dismissal, alleging that since in the criminal case there
was no reser­vation of the right to file a separate civil action for damages
the judgment of acquittal operated to ex­tinguish the civil liability of the
defendant based on the same incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, but on appeal this Court <u>reversed</u>
the ruling on the ground that the civil action was en­tirely independent of the
criminal case according to Articles 33 and 2177 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can in­deed be no other logical
conclusion than this, for to subordinate the civil action contemplated in the
said articles to the result of the criminal prosecution -whether it be
conviction or acquittal - would render meaningless the independent character of
the civil action and the clear injunction in Article 31 that this action 'may
proceed independently of the criminal proceedings and regardless of the result
of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, an exception
to this principle of separa­tion and independence of the two classes of actions
from each other has been recognized, namely, when the offended party not only
fails to reserve the right to file a separate civil action but <u>intervenes
actually in the criminal suit by appearing through a private prosecutor</u> for
the purpose of recovering indemnity for damages therein, in which case a
judgment of ac­quittal bars a subsequent civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria <span class="SpellE">Roa</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, et al., <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar, however, does not fall under
the exception, for the <u>plaintiff here did not so intervene in the criminal
action against defendant <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span></u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> contend that the civil
action referred to in Article 33 of the Civil Code is that which arises <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span>, or from the commission of the offense in­volving
defamation, fraud or physical injuries, and consequently, pursuant to Rule 107,
Section 1(a), the right to file it must be expressly reserved in the crim­inal
action if it is to prosper at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention is erroneous <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> Motor Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
presupposes that there must first be a conviction for the crime, for without
conviction there can be no offense to speak of from which civil liability could
arise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 33 contemplates a civil
action for the recovery of damages that is <u>entirely unrelated to the purely
criminal aspect</u> of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the reason why only a preponderance of evidence and not proof beyond reasonable
doubt is deemed sufficient.</blockquote>

states that in cases of defamation, fraud and physical injuries, a civil action
for damages, entirely separate and dis­tinct from the criminal action may be

institute an inde­pendent civil action.<span style="">&nbsp;

claiming damages or indemnity, and not to secure the conviction and punishment
of the accused therein as plaintiff now pretends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so because an offended party in
a criminal case may intervene personally or by attorney, in the prosecution of

<p class="2Q">"In a number of cases decided prior to <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>

institution of a criminal action for physical injuries the offended party need

<blockquote>"The issue now before us is whether or not the rule laid down
in the <span class="SpellE">Roa</span> case should govern this one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are of the opinion that there is a
demonstrable material differenc<span style="">e </span>between

decision of this Court, his <u>active intervention was allowed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if that had not been the purpose, or if
the of­fended party had reserved the right to file a sepa­rate civil action,
such intervention would not have been justified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the instant case <u>the criminal action against defendant <span class="SpellE">Luat</span> did not proceed to trial, as he pleaded guilty upon
arraignment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>mere appearance</u>
of private counsel in representation of the offended party did <u>not</u>
constitute such <u>active</u> intervention as could only import an intention to
press a claim for damages in the same action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is as reasonable to indulge the possibility that the private
prosecutors appeared precisely to be able to make a seasonable reservation of
the right to file a separate civil action which, even if unnecessary at the
time (1), would nevertheless have been the prudent and practical thing to do
for the purpose of better protecting the interests of their clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as matters turned out, the accused
pleaded guilty upon arraignment and was immediately sentenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Thereafter there was no chance to enter a
reservation in the record</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>We do not believe that plaintiff's substantive right to
claim damages should necessarily be fore­closed by the fact - at best equivocal
as to its purpose - that private prosecutors entered their ap­pearance at the
very inception of the proceeding, which was then cut short at that stage</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said with any reasonable
certainty that plaintiffs had thereby committed themselves to the submission of
their action for damages in that action.<span style="">&nbsp;

for further proceedings, with costs."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be noted that
counsel for the injured party was present at the arraignment of the accused in
the criminal case, although, in view of the plea of <span style="">guilty </span>entered by the latter, <u>there</u> <u>was</u> neither a trial,

civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the injured party was
not deemed barred from instituting the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
