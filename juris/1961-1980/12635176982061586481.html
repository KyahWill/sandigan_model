				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> in its Criminal Case No. 3285
convicting <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>,
Jr. and Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> of murder and sentencing the
first to an indeterminate penalty of from 10 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <u>mayor</u></span> to 17 years 4 months and
1 day of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal,</u></span> and the second to <span class="GramE"><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span><u>;</u></span>
both of them to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Aringo</span> in the sum of P6,000.00; and each to pay 1/3 of the
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution, relying mainly on the testimony of <span style="">two </span>eyewitnesses - <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Atun</span> and Percival Amador - and of the policemen who
went to the scene of the crime upon noticing the commotion it produced, sought
to establish the following: Between 1:00 and 2:00 o'clock <span style="">in </span>the afternoon of March 27, 1962,
some persons had a quarrel inside the <u>New <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> <span class="SpellE">Carinderia</span>,</u> an eatery located near the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Port Market, <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a short while the
protagonists came out through the backdoor of the <span class="SpellE"><u>carinderia</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> had
Rodrigo <span style="">in </span>a tight embrace from
behind, with his arms under the latter's armpits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Rodrigo was in that <span style="">position of apparent helplessness, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> </span>stabbed him with a <span class="SpellE"><u>balisong</u></span>,
or <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> knife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The stabbing continued while Rodrigo was led, or dragged, by Jose to a
bamboo bed (<span class="SpellE">papag</span>) nearby, and even after Rodrigo had
been forced down on it in a prone position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the policemen who responded to the commotion arrived, they found <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> still holding the fatal weapon, and Rodrigo's limp
body, bathed in his <span style="">own </span>blood, stretched on the <span class="SpellE"><u>papag</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A taxicab was commandeered to take the
wounded man to a hospital, but he <span style="">expired
even before </span>the vehicle could start.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The autopsy later conducted by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> <span class="SpellE">Lotivio</span>, a resident physician of the <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
<span style="">Provincial </span>Hospital, revealed
that the victim died from massive hemorrhage and shock as a result of the
multiple wounds (thirteen in all) sustained by him in the chest, abdomen, back
and the extremities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused did not take the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they presented <span style="">two </span>witnesses,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Daria</span> and Salvador <span class="SpellE">Petilos</span>,
who said that they saw the whole incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The substance of their testimony is as follows: Early in the afternoon
of March 27, 1962 <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>, a small-time peddler of
textiles in the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Port Market, was eat­ing his
lunch inside one of the eateries dotting the market site, when Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Aringo</span> <u>alias</u> Diego, a baggage boy in the same
market, approached him and demanded his fee for having carried <span class="SpellE">Avelino's</span> baggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Avelino</span></span><span style=""> said he </span>was willing to pay for the
services rendered at <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>, but not
for those rendered earlier in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then took some money from his pocket and proffered it to
Rodrigo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously peeved at having been
thus <span style="">publicly rebuffed, Rodrigo
brusquely </span>brushed <span class="SpellE">Avelino's</span> hand aside and
instantly gave him a fist blow in the face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> fell from his seat; he tried to get
up, but was given another blow, and then <span style="">a </span>third.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As he reeled from the force of the last blow a <span class="SpellE"><u>batangas</u></span>
knife he was carrying fell from his trousers pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> picked up
the knife, and Rodrigo, seeing that he <span style="">was
armed, rushed to the </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">carinderia's</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">kitchen and returned almost immediately </span>with
a 10-inch knife in his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With it he
swung at his antagonist, but the latter evaded the blow.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, an
uncle <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>,
noticed the commotion from outside the <span class="SpellE"><u>carinderia</u></span><u>,</u>
where he was loading baggage on a parked truck </span>some six meters
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shouted at Rodrigo to
stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodrigo paid no heed and instead
delivered another thrust at <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>, who again evaded
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the third attempt, Jose embraced
Rodrigo from behind, and it was at that moment that <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
stabbed Rodrigo and inflicted the numerous wounds which proved fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose took the kitchen knife from Rodrigo and
threw it away, and then released his limp body on the <span class="SpellE"><u>papag</u></span>
nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the policemen arrived <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Avelino</span></span><span style=""> </span>was still clutching the knife he had
used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both appellants were apprehended.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision rendered on <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1964</st1:date> <span style="">the
trial court sustained the prosecution's version of the incident and found </span>both
accused guilty of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
court credited <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> with the mitigating
circumstance of sufficient provocation or threat on the part of the victim, and
imposed upon him a lesser penalty than that imposed on his uncle.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' plea is self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <span style="">is </span>pre­dicated on
the theory that the deceased was himself armed with a knife with which he tried
to stab <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Avelino</span></span><span style="">, as declared </span>by the two witnesses for
the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several circumstances,
however, belie this claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">First, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
sustained no knife </span>wound at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Second, although <span style="">several
policemen </span>arrived at the scene of the incident almost immediately after
it happened, not one of them saw the knife allegedly used by Rodrigo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Nor </span><span style="">was </span>it shown to them, or at least
brought to their attention, by either of the <span style="">appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, when <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> surrendered to the policemen he declined to give
any statement, which <span style="">in the natural
course </span>of things he would have done if he had acted merely to defend
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A protestation of <span style="">in</span>nocence or justification is the
logical <span style="">and spontaneous reaction of a
man </span>who finds himself in such an <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
predicament as that in which the policemen came upon the appellants, with <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> still clutching the death <span style="">weapon and his victim </span>dying before him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But while it <span style="">is </span>clear
that <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> did not act in legitimate self-defense,
the trial court correctly held that there was sufficient provocation on the
part of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence <span style="">given </span>by the witnesses for the defense
as to how and why the fight started, and <span style="">as
</span>to the fact that the deceased hit <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> with
his fist, <span style="">is </span><span style="">not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by
the witnesses for the prosecution, who did not see the incident from the very
beginning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And one fist blow at least is
confirmed by the doctor who treated <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> for a
contusion around one eye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the fact that when <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
stabbed the victim the latter was practically helpless and unable to put up any
defense, being in the tight embrace of Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>,
was correctly appreciated by the trial court as treachery, and qualifies the
offense as murder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>
was found guilty as co-principal </span>on the ground that there was concert of
action between him and his nephew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence does not justify this finding beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the killing was
agreed upon between them <span style="">beforehand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No motive for it has
been shown </span>other than the provocation given by the deceased; and such
motive was true only insofar as <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances indicate that if Jose
embraced Rodrigo and rendered him helpless, it was to stop him from further
hitting <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> with his fists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Jose is not entirely free from
liability, for it has been established that even after the first knife thrust
had been delivered he did not try to stop <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>,
either by word or overt act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead
Jose continued to hold Rodrigo, even forced him down on the bamboo bed with <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> still pressing the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal it cannot be said that Jose's cooperation
was such that without it the offense would not have been accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But although not indispensable, it was a
contributing factor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Jose's initial
intent was free from guilt, it became tainted after he saw the first knife
thrust delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thirteen wounds
must have taken an appreciable interval of time to inflict, and Jose's
cooperation facilitated their infliction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He must therefore be held liable as an accomplice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The slaying of the
deceased having been qualified by treachery, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> is liable for murder, </span>the penalty of which
<span style="">is </span><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u></span> maximum to death (Art. 248, Revised Penal
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appreciating in favor of <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> the mitigating circumstance of sufficient pro­vocation
by the deceased without any generic aggravating circumstance to offset the
same, the penalty imposable upon him <span style="">is </span>the minimum period of the penalty for
murder (see par. 3, Art. 63, Revised Penal Code), which <span style="">is <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> maximum </span>(17
years, 4 months and 1 day to 20 years).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the resulting penalty is neither death nor life
imprisonment, the Indeterminate Sentence Law applies (Sec. 2, Act No. 4103 as
amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> <span style="">is </span>therefore
entitled to an indeterminate sentence, the upper range of which is reclusion
temporal maximum and the lower range - which <span style="">is </span>one degree lower than the penalty prescribed by the Revised
Penal Code for murder -<span style="">is </span>anywhere
within <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> maximum (10 years
and 1 day) to <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> medium (17 years and 4
months).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty meted out by the
trial court on <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>,
Jr. - "from 10 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> to 17 years 4 months and 1 day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>"
- is within the range allowed by <span style="">law </span>and <span style="">is </span>therefore correctly imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>,
the penalty prescribed by law, he being an accomplice, is one <span style="">degree lower </span>than that prescribed for
the principal, or <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> maximum
to <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> medium (10 years and <span style="">1 day </span>to 17 years and 4 months).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the Indeter­minate Sentence Law, and
considering that under paragraph 1, Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code,
"(W)hen there are neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances, (the
court) shall impose the penalty prescribed by law in its medium period,"
the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby, modified as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, as accomplice
to the offense of murder, is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from 4
years, 2 months and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> to 12 years and 1 day of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u>; the amount of the indemnity <span style="">is </span>raised from P6,000.00 to P12,000.00 to be paid the heirs of the
deceased by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Avelino</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>,
Jr. as principal; in case of the insolvency of the principal, Jose <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, as accomplice, is <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable for the indemnity due from said principal; and in all other respects the
judgment appealed from is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs in this instance.</p>
