<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING RELIEF TO THE PETITIONERS DESPITE
A PLAIN, SPEEDY and ADEQUATE REMEDY IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LAW AVAILABLE TO
THEM."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing assigned errors--appellant admits and <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> agree--may, in the context of the decisional
dispositions appealed from, be synthesized as a single determinative issue in
this appeal, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"May the
petitioners, who are the wife and minor children of one formerly an alien but a
naturalized Filipino citizen, and whose authorized periods of temporary stay
have already expired, continue <span style="">to </span>remain
in the <span style="">country?"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant--in support of his stand that petitioners, now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, have no further right to remain in this country
and should, therefore, be deported--argues that their authorized stay expired
on April 18, 1963, and, therefore, they are duty-bound to depart from the
country; and, that they cannot derive any legal right to stay simply because
their husband and father has already become a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners-<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>,
on the other hand, contend that they are now Filipino citizens pursuant to
Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law in view of Lee <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gak's</span> naturalization as of <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1964</st1:date>, and are, therefore, entitled
to stay as citizens in this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is thus obvious that the issue may be resolved by (1) a determi­nation of the
conflicting claims as to the effect of Lee <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gak's</span> naturalization on the citizenship of the petitioners,
and (2) the effect of the expiry, prior to Lee <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gak's</span> naturalization, of the periods of petitioners
authorized stay in this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit <span style="">in </span>this
appeal.</p>

<blockquote>1. It is now a settled rule that the wife and minor children of a
Chinese resident, who was naturalized as a Filipino citizen, acquired
Philippine citizenship under the conditions laid down in Section 15 of the
Revised Naturalization Law, and consequently, they cannot be deported.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This rule applies notwithstanding the expiry of the periods of their temporary
stay in the country prior to their acquisition of Filipino citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For petitione<span style="">rs' </span>acquisition of Filipino citizenship, in the language of Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, "... naturally bestows upon
them the right <span style="">to </span>stay in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>...and
if they elect to reside here, the Immigration authorities may neither deport

<p class="BODY">Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Effect of
the naturalization on </u><u><span style="">wife </span>and
children</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any woman who is now or
may hereafter be married to a naturalized citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and who might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Minor children of persons naturalized under this law and who have
been born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall be considered citizens thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A foreign-born minor child, if dwelling in the Philippines at the
time of the naturalization of the parent, shall automatically become a
Philippine citizen, and a foreign-born minor child, who is not in the
Philippines at the time the parent is naturalized, shall be deemed a Philippine
citizen only during his minority, unless he begins to reside permanently in the
Philippines when still a minor, in which case, he will continue to be a
Philippine citizen even after becoming of age.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prevailing rule is that under Section 15, an a lien woman
marrying a Philippine citizen, whether native-born or naturalized, becomes <u>ipso</u>
<u>facto</u> a Philippine citizen provided that she is not disqualified under
Section 4 of the same law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, an
alien woman married to a foreigner, who subsequently becomes a naturalized
Filipino citizen, acquires Philippine citizenship the moment her husband takes
his oath as Philippine citizen provided that she does not have any of the
disqualifications under said Section 4.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, Lee Nee <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiao</span> Eng became a Filipino citizen when her husband, Lee <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gak</span> took his oath of
allegiance on <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1964</st1:date>,
if she did not have any of the disqualifi­cations which would bar her from
becoming a Philippine citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
her children, who were in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and of minor age at the time their father was naturalized also automatically
became Philippine citizens by virtue of the same Section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Filipino citizens, petitioners <span style="">cannot, </span>therefore, be deported.</p>

<p class="BODY">As indicated in Opinion No. 38, Series of <span style="">1958, </span>of the Acting Secretary of Justice,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the married alien woman must file a petition for cancellation of her alien
certificate of registration with the Bureau of Immigration alleging, among
other things, that she is married to a Filipino citizen and that she is not
disqualified from acquiring her <span style="">husband's
</span>citizenship under Section 4 of the Revised Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon filing of said petition, which <span style="">should </span>be supported by <span style="">the joint affi</span>davit of the petitioner
and her Filipino husband to the effect that she does not belong to any of the
groups disqualified under Section 4, the Bureau of <span style="">Immigration will </span>conduct an investigation and thereafter
promulgate its decision granting <span style="">or </span>denying
the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the other petitioners, children of Lee <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gak</span>, it should be noted

the Associate <span style="">Commissioner of </span>Immigration,
<span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> N. Gaston, granted their petition for
