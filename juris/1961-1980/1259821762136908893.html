				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur denying 
a motion to set aside an alias writ of execution.
<p>On June 19, 1946, Mariano B. Delgado, acting through his wife, and defendant 
Wenceslao A. Lirag executed a deed whereby Delgado sold to Lirag a parcel of 
land situated in the municipality of Tinambac, Camarines Sur, for a specified 
price, payable in the manner therein stipulated. Alleging that Lirag had 
violated the terms of the agreement, on July 12, 1954, Delgado instituted this 
action, in said court, for the recovery of P8,000, plus attorney's fees and 
costs.</p>
<p>After the filing of Lirag's answer, or on December 20, 1954, the parties 
submitted to the court the following compromise agreement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"COME NOW the plaintiff and the defendant in the above-entitled case, 
assisted by their respective counsel, and to this Honorable Court respectfully 
submit the following agreement:</p>
<ol><li>That the parties hereby agree to rescind the deed of sale marked Annex 'A' 
to the complaint, dated June 19, 1946, subject to the conditions stated 
below;<br>
</li><li>That <em>the plaintiff will pay to the defendant the sum of P13,500.00 on or 
before December 31, 1955</em>, in full payment and satisfaction of all sums of 
money received by the plaintiff from the defendant as well as expenses incurred 
by the latter. Upon full payment of this amount, the <em>defendant will deliver 
to the plaintiff the land which is the subject-matter of the said deed of sale 
of June 19, 1946;</em><br>
</li><li>That the parties mutually relinquish their claims for damages and attorney's 
fees against one another;<br>
</li><li>That the <em>plaintiff may sell, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of the land 
subject-matter</em> of the sale dated June 19, 1946, or any part thereof <em>in 
order to raise such sum as may be necessary to pay the aforementioned amount of 
P13,500.00 to the defendant</em>, provided however, that no sale, mortgage or 
disposition made by the nlaintifF shall be valid unless made with the consent of 
the defendant; and that <em>in case of disagreement the matter shall be settled 
by the Court</em>. </li></ol>
<p>Wherefore, the parties respectfully <em>request that the foregoing agreement 
be approved and judgment be rendered in accordance therewith</em>, without 
pronouncement as to costs." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 23, 1954, the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur rendered a 
decision transcribing and incorporating as part thereof said compromise 
agreement, the dispositive part of which decision reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view thereof, the foregoing agreement is approved and judgment is 
rendered in conformity therewith, without pronouncement as to 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>On May 2, 1955, Delgado conveyed all his rights in and ,to the aforementioned 
property to one Valeric P. Tria, who, with Lirag's conformity, subsequently, 
substituted Delgado as plaintiff in this case. On February 29, 1956, Lirag filed 
a "motion for execution", upon the ground that Tria had not paid the sum of 
P13,500.00 on or before December 31, 1955, in violation of the compromise 
agreement and the decision. Over Tria's objection, the motion was granted by an 
order dated June 5, 1956. No appeal having been taken therefrom, the 
corresponding writ of execution was issued oh October 25, 1956. For reasons not 
stated in the record, said writ was not enforced. Hence, on motion of Lirag, an 
alias writ of execution was issued on January 29, 1958. Soon thereafter, or on 
February 18, 1958, Tria tiled a "motion to lift alias writ of execution", which 
was denied by an order dated March 1, 1958. Hence, this appeal by Tria.</p>
<p>Tria maintains that his failure to pay the sum of P13,500.00—which, according 
to the compromise agreement, incorporated into the decision was due on or before 
December 31, 1955—was imputable to Lirag, because the latter had, in violation 
of said agreement, refused to lend him (Tria) the original certificate of title 
to the property in question, as well as to sign papers and pleadings necessary 
to enable him (Tria) to raise funds which to pay said amount. This pretense was 
rejected by the lower court in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The motion is opposed on the ground that the movant, Wenceslao A. Lirag, 
violated the decision by refusing to lend to Valerio P. Tria Original 
Certificate of Title No. 181 and other papers necessary to enable him to 
contract a loan. The falsity of his excuse is patent. Under the terras of the 
decision, should any controversy arise between the parties over the stipulation 
allowing Delgado, Tria's predecessor in interest, to mortgage the land in 
question, it should be submitted to this Court for decision. Tria failed to call 
the attention of this Court to the alleged refusal of Delgado so that the 
controversy could be resolved conformably to the decision. Again, on January 14, 
1956, Counsel for Tria, Atty. Ruperto, sent Atty. Luntok, Lirag's counsel, a 
letter in answer to the latter's demand that Tria pay the amount of the judgment 
within 15 days. In that letter, Atty. Ruperto made no mention whatsoever of 
Lirag's alleged refusal to lend the title and other papers necessary to enable 
Tria to secure a loan. On the contrary, he requested that Tria be given an 
additional period within which to pay."</p></blockquote>
<p>We are fully in agreement with this view, which is borne out by the record. 
Eesides, notice of Lirag's motion for execution of the decision was duly served 
upon Tria, who filed a written opposition thereto. Yet, when the lower court 
issued its order of June 5, 1956, overruling this opposition and granting said 
motion, Tria did not appeal from said order and thus allowed it to become final 
and executory. He did not question its propriety until after the issuance of an 
alias writ of execution on January 29, 1958, or more than a year and a half 
later. It is now too late, therefore, to invoke the alleged breach of the 
compromise agreement by Lirag as a ground to bar the execution of the decision 
in this case. He could have, and should have, taken it up on appeal from the 
order of June 5, 1956.</p>
<p>Tria insists that the compromise agreement was merely a contract, which may 
be enforced by ordinary action for 6pecific performance, not by writ of 
execution. Said compromise agreement is, however, more than a contract. It had 
been submitted to the court for approval with the request that judgment be 
rendered in accordance therewith, and was accordingly approved by the court and 
incorporated into its decision, which was "rendered in conformity therewith". In 
other words, it was part and parcel of the judgment and may, therefore, be 
enforced, as such, by writ of execution. (Art. 2037, Civil Code of the 
Philippines.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
plaintiff-appellant, Valerio P. Tria. It is so ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., 
Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes,</em> and 
<em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
