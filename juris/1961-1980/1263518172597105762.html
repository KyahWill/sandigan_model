				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for certiorari and mandamus involving the
orders of Hearing Officer Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> of the
Workmen's Compensation Commission, dated July 7 and <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1965</st1:date>, issued in connection with a number
of employees' compensation claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 30 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act (No. 3428, as amended), respondent <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kap</span> Printing Press secured from petitioner Philippine
British Assurance Co., Inc., thru the latter's general agent, the St. Mary
Insurance Agency, Inc., a workmen's compensation insurance policy to cover payment
of all compensation benefits to which the insured's workers or laborers might
be legally entitled in accordance with said Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the policy was in force a number of employees filed their
respective compensation claims against <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kap</span> Printing Press, which claims were later amended to
include the Philippine British Assurance Co., Inc. as party respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of the aforesaid claims the
company filed its answers, with cross-claims against the <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kap</span> Printing Press, alleging that the insurance
policy was null and void on the ground that at the time it was issued the
insured concealed from the insurer the fact that "the claimants as well as
other employees of the insured were suffering from various illnesses and/or had
consulted the company physician on various matters of importance to their
health," and that consequently any <span style="">sums
</span>which the insurer might be compelled to pay under said policy should be
reimbursed by the insured employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kap</span>
Printing Press moved to dismiss the cross-claims, to which motion the
Philippine British Assurance Co., Inc. filed its written opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="7">July
 7, 1965</st1:date> the Hearing Officer of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission dismissed the cross-claims on ground of lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="7">July
 23, 1965</st1:date> the insurer filed a petition for review, to which an
opposition was filed by the claimants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On August <span style="">4 following the
Hearing Officer denied </span>the petition for <span style="">review on the ground that the order dismissing the </span>cross-<span style="">claims was not subject to appeal or review,
being an interlocutory order not affecting the merits of the compensation
claims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The two issues posed before us for resolution are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not the Workmen's Compensation
Commission has jurisdiction over the cross-claims filed by the insurer against
the insured employer; and (2) whether or not the order of the Hearing Officer
dismissing the cross-claims for lack of jurisdiction is subject to review by
the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner contends that
the Workmen's Compensation Commission has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate
an insurer's cross-claim against an insured employer under </span>Section
30-(f) of Republic Act 4119 and that to hold otherwise wo<span style="">uld </span>be in effect putting the insurer
out of court, considering that cross-claims not set up shall be barred.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 30(f) of Republic
Act 4119 amending the Workmen's Compensation Act provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. <span class="GramE">30(f</span>). Every policy of
insurance issued under this section shall contain a provision that, as between
the employee and the insurance carrier, the notice to or knowledge, of the
occurrence of the injury or accident on the part of the employer shall be
deemed notice or knowledge, as the case may be, on the part of the insurance
carrier; that jurisdiction over the employer is jurisdiction over the insurance
carrier; and the insurance carrier shall in all things be bound by and subject
to the orders, findings, decisions or awards rendered against the employer for
the payment of compensation under the provisions of this Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every such policy shall also contain a provision
to the effect that the insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer shall not
relieve the insurance carrier from the payment of compensation for injury,
illness or death sustained by an employee during the life of such policy."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing provision
is silent </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to the jurisdiction of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission over the </span>subject-<span style="">matter here under consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But since the </span>Commission is an administrative body created by law
to perform a specific quasi-judicial function it possesses only such
jurisdiction as is conferred directly by the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 46 of the Workmen's Compensation Act
defines this jurisdiction as <span style="">fol</span>lows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 46.</span> <span class="GramE">Jurisdiction.</span>
- The Workmen's Compensation Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
hear and decide claims for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act,
subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, in the same manner and in the same
period as provided by law and by rules of court for appeal from the court of
Industrial Relations to the Supreme Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Of course, by express mandate of Section 30-f, jurisdiction over
the employer is jurisdiction over the insurer, but this is true only insofar as
the employees' claims, and hence the insurer's liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
by virtue of the policy, are concerned, the only question at issue being the
compensability of such claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
grounds upon which petitioner's cross-claims are based are not alleged by way
of defense with respect to this issue and have no bearing thereon
whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner defines its
position succinctly as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"that while it stands responsible to claimants...in any amount that
the Workmen's Compensation Commission may finally adjudicate, nevertheless,
since the insured employer...violated the terms of the Insurance Act as well as
the terms of the policy itself any amount adjudicated by the Commission may be
recovered by Philippine British from <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kap</span>." These matters, however, are purely between the
insurer and the insured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged
breaches of the terms and conditions of the insurance contract have nothing to
do with whether the claimants-employees are entitled to the compensation
benefits asserted, but rather to the contractual relations between the <span class="GramE">insurer</span> and insured.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> matters which pertain to
the ordinary courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Larson's Workmen's Compensation Law, Vol. 3, 1968 ed., p. 443).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise the hearing and adjudication
thereof - for which a hearing officer of the Workmen's Compensation may not be
properly equipped - may needlessly tie up and delay the resolution of the main
issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, the argument that petitioner's cross-claims will be
barred if not set up in the answer cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the other issue raised by petitioner, that is,
whether or not the hearing officer (or referee) should have referred the
petition for review of his orders to the Commission, it seems that his refusal
to do so on the ground that the said orders were interlocutory took <span style="">note of the fact that no decision on the main
claims had yet been rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
implication is that the petition should await the decision so that the entire
case could be elevated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling is
not entirely without basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place, if the hearing officer, after receiving the evidence on the claims of
the employees, should decide that they are not compensable at all, then
petitioner's cross-claims would be unnecessary and the elevation of the order
dismissing them to the Commission, in advance of the decision itself, would
have been at least premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">fair presumption that this was the import of the hearing officer's
statement that the order complained of was interlocutory, aware as he must have
been of the provision of Section 4, Rule 15 of the Rules of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span> <span class="GramE">Duties of
Referee.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">- <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In case the referee does not render a new decision or amend
or modify the deci­sion or order sought to be reviewed, he shall immediately
issue an order denying the petition for review or motion for re­consideration
and elevating the entire case to the Commission for review."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is to be noted that
the foregoing rule speaks of "elevating the </span><u><span style="">entire</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">case to the Commission
for review." Obviously the entire case is not supposed to be </span><span style="">elevated </span><span style="">unless the employees' claims are first decided by the hearing officer,
for there can be no review of the entire case while the principal cause of
action has not been resolved in the first instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, we
agree with petitioner that if the sense of the ruling of the hearing officer is
that his order dismissing the cross-claims is not subject to review by the
Commission at all, then said ruling </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">palpably erroneous,
being contrary to Section 1 of the </span><span style="">same
</span><span style="">Rule 15 referred to above, which
</span><span style="">says </span><span style="">that "any party-in-interest who is
dissatisfied with the decision or order of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">referee may within
fifteen (15) days from receipt of notice thereof file with the referee a
petition for the review or reconsideration of said decision or order."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But whatever be the import of the order of the hearing officer
now sought to be reviewed - that it is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Commission at all or that the appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
was premature - we have deemed it wise and expedient to resolve the question of
jurisdiction on the merits in connection with the first issue, for to return
the case below so that the Commission may consider and resolve it would be an
exercise in futility, and might only involve further delay of the case to the
prejudice of the claimants-employees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the writ prayed for is denied and the petition
dismissed, with costs against petitioner.</p>
