<span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bibiana</span> Cortes

<p class="BODY">The Court of Agrarian Relations set CAR Case No. 492 <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 63 for pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notices of the pre-trial were sent to the counsel of the parties by said
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several postponements the
Court of Agrarian, Relations, by an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1965</st1:date>, finally set the case for pre-trial
conference and hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1965</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bogo</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="1">January 6,
 1965</st1:date>, was sent to the lawyers of the parties, namely, Atty. Jesus
M. <span class="SpellE">Almirante</span> for plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span> and Atty. Gabriel J. <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>
for defendant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No notices of pre-trial conference were sent

<p class="BODY">For failure of defendant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span> and his counsel, Atty. Gabriel J. <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, to be present at the pre-trial conference held on
March 2, 1965, relative to CAR Case No. 492-Cebu '63, the court declared him in
default upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelayo's</span>
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, on the same day,
plaintiff therein, <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>,
was allowed to present his evidence <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforementioned <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, CAR
Case No. 492-Cebu '63, was decided by the trial court on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1965</st1:date> in favor of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>, ordering the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the defendant tenant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span>, A copy of the decision was served upon
counsel for <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, a writ of execution, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1965</st1:date>, was issued to enforce the
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Claiming that he has no more remedy left to obtain relief from
the judgment, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span>
filed CAR Case No. 601- <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> '65 against <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span> for the
annulment of the proceedings had in CAR Case No. 492-Cebu '63.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground relied upon for this action is
that the Court of Agrarian Relations had no authority to declare him in default
for his failure and that of his counsel to appear in the pre­-trial conference
on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1965</st1:date>, as he was
not personally served with notice thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There having been no valid pre­-trial, he claims that all proceedings in
said case are null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a defendant in CAR Case No. 601-Cebu.'65, <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span> moved to dismiss the action on the ground that
the filing of an independent action, CAR Case No. 601-Cebu '65, is not the
proper remedy available to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span> as he should have filed a motion to lift the order
of default and in case of denial, to petition for relief under Rule 38 of the
Rules of Court or perfect an appeal from the decision in CAR Case No. 492-Cebu
'63.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss having been
denied, <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>
answered the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1966</st1:date>,
the parties in CAR Case No. 601-Cebu '65 filed an agreed statement of facts and
submitted said case for decision without introducing evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1966</st1:date>,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed CAR Case No. 601-Cebu '65 because
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span>
did not avail of the remedies under Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court for
relief from the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court also
said that even if the complaint in CAR Case No. 601-Cebu '65 were treated as a
petition for relief from the judgment in CAR Case No. 492-Cebu '63, the same
did not comply with the requisites of Rule 38 as regards verification of the
petition, affidavit of merit and allegation of good and substantial cause of
action or defense,</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span>
forthwith filed a motion for reconsideration and in a resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1966</st1:date>, the court <u>a quo</u>
denied the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present
appeal, docketed as CA-G.R. No. 38200-R, of the Court of Appeals seeking to set
aside the resolution of the lower court dated August 8, 1966 denying the motion
for reconsideration filed by plaintiff in CAR Case No, 601-Cebu '65; to set
aside the resolution of the same court dated April 5, 1966 dismissing CAR Case
No, 601-Cebu '65; and to declare that the said court has no power and authority
to declare the defendant in CAR Case No. 492-Cebu '63 in default and to declare
all proceedings in this latter case null and void and without effect; to
require the lower court to reopen and reinstate CAR Case No. 492-Cebu '63 and
to allow the parties thereto to present their evidence; to order the plaintiffs
in CAR Case No, 492-Cebu '63 to return and deliver to defendant therein the
possession of the land subject of the litigation and all improvements thereon
and for defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to pay the costs in CAR 3
Case No, 601-Cebu '65.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals in its
Resolution, the only issue presented for determination is whether it is
required under Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court that the parties, aside
from their counsel, should also be served with notice to appear at the time,
date and place of the pre-trial conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span> maintains that as defendant in CAR Case No.
492-Cebu '63, he and his counsel are entitled to be served notice of the
pre-trial conference "because Section 1 of Rule 20 has made it expressly
mandatory that such notice of pre-trial be served upon the parties and not only
upon the counsels of the parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span> contends that
service of notice upon the attorneys is sufficient and binding upon the parties
unless service upon the latter is ordered by the Court in accordance with
Section 2, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He contends that Rule 20 of the Rules of Court is not applicable in the
case; that there is no necessity for the court to direct the parties and their
attorneys to appear before it in a pre-trial conference since parties may
conduct their litigation personally or by the aid of attorneys in accordance
with Section 34 of Rule 138 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, according to him, notice to counsel is
notice to the parties per Section 2, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 6, 1965, when the court <u>a quo</u> issued the order
resetting for the last time the pre-trial conference of CAR Case No. 492-Cebu
'63 on March 2, 1965 resulting in the order declaring <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span> in default for failure to appear for the
pre-trial conference, Section 1, Rule 20, Revised Rules of Court was applicable
to the Court of Agrarian Relations be­cause Section 155 of the Land Reform Code
which took effect on August 8, 1963 provides that the Courts of Agrarian
Relations shall be governed by the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the counsel of the plaintiff-appellant that notice
of a pre-trial conference should be sent not only to the attorneys but also to
the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention of the
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is that notice to counsel is
notice to the party, citing Section 2, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that under the cited
Section and Rule, a notice to counsel is a notice to the party.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in a long line of decisions,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
has sustained this rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular
section is the general rule governing the filing and serving of papers and
orders of courts upon parties affected thereby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, since there is a specific provision of the Revised Rules of
Court governing service of notice specifically for pre-trial conference,
Section 1, Rule 20 thereof, there is no reason for applying the general rule as
the court <u>a quo</u> had done.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a 1975 case,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
this Tribunal, ruling on the matter of pre-trial, declared:</p>

<blockquote>"We hold that before the party is non-suited or considered in
default, it must be shown that the party and his counsel were duly served with
a notice of such pre-trial conference.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this purpose, <u>notice of the pre-trial must be served separately
upon the part affected thereby and his counsel of record</u>, stating therein
the purpose, time and place of the pre-trial conference and requiring said
party and his counsel to appear thereat." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, interpreting more cogently Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules
of Court, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
said:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Notice of pre-trial must be served separately upon the party
and his counsel . . . . This requirement is based on <u>Rule 20, Section 1
which makes pre-trial mandatory</u> and provides that 'after the last pleading
has been filed, the court shall direct the parties and their attorneys to
appear before it' for a pre-trial conference and on Section 2 which further
provides that (A) party who fails to appear at a pre-trial conference may be
non-suited or considered in default . . . . considering, however, the adverse
effects of a party's failure to appear at the pre-trial conference, before the
party is non-suited or considered in default, it must be shown that the party
and his counsel were duly served with notice of such pre-trial
conference." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A case in point is <span class="SpellE">Aducayen</span> vs. <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Municipal Court held a pre-trial conference and declared the
defendants in default because they failed to appear in said pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Briefly the facts are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Municipal Judge, in a complaint
filed before him for the collection of a sum of money, believing that he could
set a pre-trial conference, did schedule one at a certain date and time after
defendants had filed their answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendants, <span class="SpellE">Aducayen</span> being one of two and the
petitioner for review on <i><u>certiorari</u></i> with this Court, were not
served notice of the pre-trial conference resulting in their non­appearance
thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only counsel of the two
defendants appeared, having been served with notice of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Aducayen</span> received a copy
of the decision of the Municipal Judge which mentioned therein that evidence
was adduced solely by the plaintiff in view of the "default of defendant
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Aducayen</span>, who failed to appear at the scheduled
pre-trial conference." And, " . . . . finding the cause of action set
forth therein to have been sufficiently established, judgment in favor of
plaintiff and against defendant is hereby rendered as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Said the learned Mr. Justice Fernando on this judgment, speaking
for this Tribunal:</p>

<blockquote>"Where the facts disclosed a clear denial of procedural due
process, in that the municipal judge defaulted the defend­ant, even though he
duly filed an answer to the complaint and was not notified of the date of
pre-trial, and then a judgment was rendered against him on plaintiff's evidence
heard <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>, such a judgment is void and in
this sense 'it may be said to be a lawless thing, which can be treated as an
outlaw and slain at sight, or ignored wherever and whenever it exhibits its
head,' (Quoting Justice Street in <span class="SpellE">Banco-Espanol-Filipino</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, 37 Phil. 921 (1918).)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There having been no valid pre-trial conference for failure to
serve notice upon the party defendant in CAR Case No. 492-Cebu '63 as
prescribed by Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court, the order declaring the
defendant in default and the reception of evidence presented by the opposite
party, <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>, the judgment rendered and the
writ of execution and the order issued to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagarino</span> to show cause why he should not be held in
contempt, must be held, as We hereby hold, as invalid, null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of the trial court dated August
8, 1966 denying the motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiff-appellant in
CAR Case No. 601-Cebu '65 as well as the resolution of the same court of April
5, 1966 dismissing CAR Case No. 601-Cebu '65 and all proceedings had relative
