Luzon Stevedoring Corporation, seeking a review of a resolution of January 11,
1966, of respondent Social Security Commission, which set aside a reduction in
the monthly pension of three retired employees, the private respondents, is
foreclosed by <span style="">our </span>holding in
Rivera v. San Miguel Brewery Corp.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>It is
petitioner's contention that the appealed resolution of respondent Commission
is bereft of support in law, as the integration of its private pension plan
with the Social Security System could not have the legal effect of increasing
its financial liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a view of
petitioner, asserted before respondent Commission and adhered to tenaciously in
its brief submitted on May 2, 1967, was reflected in the aforesaid San Miguel
Brewery Corporation case, decisive of this controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not have been relied upon by
petitioner as it <span style="">was </span>decided
only after a year and two months later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respect for its controlling force calls for a reversal of the resolution
now on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted in the brief for petitioner Luzon
Stevedoring Corporation: "Respondents <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and Castillo are retired employees of the
petitioner at the latter's branch office in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>; <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span> having retired on November 30, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> on December 31, 1961 and Castillo on April 30,
1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since their retirement <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and Castillo
received monthly pensions from the petitioner in the amounts of P140.93,
P120.14 and P49.50, res­pectively pursuant to the petitioner's 1952 Plan for
Pensions and Death Benefits, a private plan exclusively maintained by herein
petitioner and to which none of the individual respondents nor any employee of
the petitioner for that matter contributes a single centavo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In July 1963 the monthly pension of <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and Castillo
were reduced by P22.99, P28.59 and P14.58 respectively petitioner having
exercised the prerogatives it reserved for it in the 1952 Plan for Pensions and
Death Benefits."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such reduction was questioned by respondents <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and Castillo before the Social Security
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An agreed statement of facts
was submitted by the parties, after a motion to dismiss filed by the Luzon
Stevedoring Corporation on the ground of lack of jurisdiction was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to such stipulation: "That
petitioners are retired employees of the respondent, both family men, <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span> of 65 years and 9 months; Castillo of 63 years
and 11 months; and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> 62 years and 11 months;
That petitioners <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span> rendered 36 years and 6
months since with the respondent; Castillo, 25 years and 10 months; and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, 28 years and 7 months; That by virtue of and
under the 1952 Plan for Pensions and Death Benefits adopted by the respondent
effective since July 1, 1952, and in view of their length of service and the
rates of monthly pays, petitioners were granted lump sum retirement allowances
and monthly pensions as computed by respondent in the attached schedules for
individual petitioners, * * *; That both petitioners and respondent are covered
members since 1958 of the Social Security System, with membership numbers as
alleged in paragraph 2 of the petition; and that with respect to the premiums
paid by petitioners and the contributions paid by the respondent to these
premiums, the Honorable Commission may take judicial notice from the records
and files of the system; That under the <span class="SpellE">unintegrated</span>
1952 Plan for Pensions and Death <span style="">Benefits
of </span>respondent, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span> received <span style="">a </span><span style="">monthly pension of </span>P140.93 since his retirement on <span style="">November 30, 1962; </span><span class="SpellE">Aniano</span>
Castillo, the <span style="">sum </span>of P49.50 since
<span style="">his retirement on April </span>30,
1960; and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, the sum of <span style="">P120.14 </span>since his retirement on
December 31, 1961; That on March <span style="">15,
1963, </span>respondent issued to all its <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Branch <span style="">employees </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">memorandum,
integrating its 1952 Plan for Pensions and Death </span>Benefits with the
Social <span style="">Security System* </span>* *;
That with respect to the petitioners, the integration was sought <span style="">to be </span>implemented by respondent,
beginning the month of July, 1963, and as a result thereof, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span> was to receive P140.93 to P110.94 a month, a
reduction of P29.99; Castillo from P49.50 to P34.90, or a reduction of P14.50; <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> </span>from
P120.14 to P91.55, or a reduction of P28.59; That the reduction of P29.99,
P14.58 and P28.59 from the respective pensions of <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span>,
Castillo and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> received from the respondent
are seven-twelfth (7/12) of P51.42, P25.00 and P49.02 which they respectively
receive from the Social Security System as their monthly pensions <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> * * *; That petitioners admit that respondent's
1952 Plan for Pensions and Death Benefits is exclusively maintained by said
respondent, to which petitioners or any employee of the said respondent do not contribute
a single centavo; and That the parties admit that petitioner's reduced pension
as alleged in paragraph 7 hereof, from the month of July, 1963 up to the
present, have been paid and received by petitioners from respondent subject to
the reservation that despite the receipt of said reduced pensions, the parties
submit to this Honorable Commission the issue of the legality or illegality of
said reductions as a result of the integration of respondent's 1952 Plan for
Pensions and Death Benefits with the Social Security System, * * *. "<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the respondent Commission issued the aforesaid
resolution of January 11, 1966, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads: "[Wherefore], the petition is hereby granted and
the respondent directed to pay to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Parohinog</span> the amount of P29.99, to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> the sum
of P28.59, and to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aniano</span> C. Castillo the
sum of P14.58, representing the monthly reductions from the appropri­ate
pensions under its private plan from July, 1963, contrary to Section 9 of the
law, in relation to the parties' agreement, and to continue paying them said
amounts in addition to the reduced pensions they are now receiving for as long
as they are entitled <span style="">thereto."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence, this petition for review which, as
noted at the outset, is on solid ground in view of our decision in Rivera v. </span><span style="">San </span><span style="">Miguel Corporation already referred to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have no choice then but to find for petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. Petitioner, in its resolute effort to do away with the appealed
resolution, would go further than merely challenge its conformity with
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its first error assigned would deny
respondent Commission any authority to act on the matter in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not merely seek to fasten a
restrictive interpretation to Section 5 of the Social Security Act which, on
its face, would show that any dispute arising therein "with respect to
coverage entitlement to benefits, collection and settlement of premium
contributions and penalties thereon, or any other matter related thereto, shall
be cognizable by the Commission <span style="">* * *.
"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On its face, support for the competence of
respondent Commission to decide as to whether or not private respondents could
be made to suffer a reduction in their pensions </span><span style="">wo</span><span style="">uld thus seem to be
evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, by viewing most
narrowly the authority thus conferred, petitioner would allege the
contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would go even further
invoking the principle of separation of powers to maintain that as the matter
is primarily judicial, the judiciary, not respondent Commission, is vested with
jurisdiction.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner thus pays obeisance to a concept of separation of
powers, in all its traditional rigidity, oblivious of consider­ations that
preclude an inflexible adherence to such a postulate if government under the
stress and strain of problems of ever-increasing complexity is to discharge
effectively its responsi­bilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
to be admitted that the functions of government in the main are distributed to
three departments, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial, which are
independent, co-ordinate and co-equal, with each of them having exclusive
cognizance of matters within its jurisdiction, supreme within its own sphere,
and free from interference in the exercise of powers entrusted to it, subject
to the scheme <span style="">a
</span>checks and balance as constitutionally ordained.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It is likewise a truism that on the legislature is vested the authority to make
the laws, on the executive to enforce them, and on the judiciary to interpret
them in the course of deciding <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
controversies of <span style="">a </span>private as well as of a public character in the course of
which the legality of the acts of the other two branches may be tested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would thus logically conclude that
the dispute between it and the three private respondents turning on their
respective rights under the private pension plan subsequently integrated in the
social security scheme, the courts, not respondent Commission, constitute the
appropriate forum for its resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is to ignore, however, that the principle of separation of
powers is a relative theory of government not to be enforced with pedantic
rigor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a principle of statesmanship
the practical demands of statecraft would argue against its theoretical application.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Laurel, with vigor and clarity, expressed the matter thus: "The
classical separation of governmental powers, whether viewed in the light of the
political philosophy of Aristotle, Locke, or Montesquieu, or of the
postulations of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>, Madison, or <span style="">Jefferson, </span>is a relative theory of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is more truism and
actually an interdependence than in independence and separation of powers, for
as observed by Justice Holmes in a case of Philippine origin, we cannot lay
down 'with mathematical precision and divide the branches into watertight
compartments' not only because 'the great ordinances of the Constitution do not
establish and divide fields of black and white' but <span style="">also </span>because ‘<span style="">even </span>the
more specific of them are found to terminate in a penumbra shading gradually
from one extreme to the other.' (Springer vs. Government [1928], 277 US, 189;
72 Law. ed., 845, 852.)"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus in <span class="SpellE">Arnault</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
in sustaining the power of a court of first instance to allow a person detained
for having been found in contempt of Congress to be released for a period of
not <span style="">less </span>than <span style="">six </span>hours as "a measure of
necessity for an adequate preparation" for his trial in a pending criminal
case, it was stated in the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>,
speaking <span style="">for </span>the Court, that
separation of powers <span style="">"is not rigid
and </span>absolute but abstract and general, intended for practical purposes
and adapted to common sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
such thing as complete and definite designation by the Constitution of all the
particular powers that appertain to each of the several departments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional structure is a complicated
system, and <span class="SpellE">overlappings</span> of governmental functions
are recognized, unavoidable, and inherent necessities of governmental
coordination."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Only lately, in Binging Ho v. Municipal Board of Canvassers,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, through Justice J. B. L. Reyes, in sustaining the validity of the
authority conferred on courts of first instance to order a judicial recount and
thus rejecting the contention that the function performed is administrative
rather than judicial, and therefore cannot be conferred on a court, adhered to
such an approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Appellant
also seems to have overlooked one basic feature of our tripartite system of
government: the existence of what Justice Holmes so appropriately termed penumbra
of governmental powers, of authorities 'shading gradually from one extreme <span style="">to </span>the other', and the absence of a
mathematically precise distinctive line between the actions of the recognized
branches of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realistically,
the practical demands of efficient government would prevent strict observance
of the principle of separation of powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it has been said that in determining the constitutionality of the
exercise of power by a department, the question to be asked is not whether the
power is essentially legislative, executive or judicial, but whether <span style="">it </span>has been specifically vested in it
by the Constitution, or properly incidental to the performance of the functions
of that department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where the power
is not peculiarly or distinctly legislative, executive or judicial, it is
within the authority of the legislature to determine where its exercise would
belong."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The doctrine of separation of powers then rightly viewed constitutes no
obstacle to respondent Commission inquiring into the validity of the reduction
of the pension of private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">To view the question more narrowly, there is no merit to
petitioner's assumption, flowing from his own reading of the implications of
separation of powers, that the performance of a function, quasi-judicial in
character, cannot be constitutionally <span style="">vested
in an administrative agency like respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The teaching of our decisions from the
earliest years under this system of government is precisely to the
contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief Justice Arellano as far
back as 1902 in a case reported in the first volume of the Philippine Reports,
erased any doubt that executive officials could in the discharge of their
functions pass upon and decide </span>legal questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the statutory power of the then
Collector of Customs "to prevent the entrance into the country of persons
from abroad whom he had reasonable grounds to believe guilty of having aided,
abetted, or instigated insurrection, <span style="">or
w</span><span style="">hom he [suspected] of coming to
the Philippines" with that purpose in mind, was upheld.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Necessarily, the performance of such a task
entailed the exercise of discretion <span style="">judicial
in </span>character, but that was no argument against its validity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">So it has been since then.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
To cast doubt, then, on the power of respondent Commission to assume
jurisdiction over the question here presented on the ground <span style="">that it </span>is legal in character and is
therefore cognizable only by courts of justice, comes rather late in the
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot quite carry
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention, if sustained
<span style="">would be </span>visited with
consequences far from desirable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if
it were thus, the enforcement of statutes intended, in the language of Justice
Laurel, to cope with "the growing complexity of <span style="">modern life" </span>calling for "the multiplication of the
subjects of governmental regulation"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>may be doomed to futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since statecraft must face the test of
actuality and necessarily pragmatic in its approach, there is no justification
for such insistence on ironclad formalism.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is undeniable is that if, as is the case with the social
security statutory scheme, its success depends on the respondent Commission
having to exercise the powers of rule-making and adjudication, then so it must
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any objection even from
the analytical standpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine
of separation of powers has not been ignored or disregarded, for neither the
lawmaking nor the judging prerogative is actually entrusted to respondent
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its function remains the
enforcement and execution of the statute of its creation, impressed at times,
and necessarily so, with either a quasi-legislative or a quasi-judicial
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus appear beyond
doubt that the first assignment of error is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2. Petitioner submits in its second assignment of error that
respondent Commission's holding that the reductions made by petitioner in the
monthly pensions of <span style="">private respondents
was </span>without legal justification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The assertion thus made, a matter concededly far from settled when
advanced, was, as <span style="">had been </span>pointed
out, found subsequently entitled to approval in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
case of Rivera v. San Miguel Brewery <span style="">Corporation,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the facts of which would </span><span style="">appear to be highly
</span><span style="">similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As set forth in the opinion of a
unanimous Court <span style="">penned </span>by
Justice Castro: "The Company <span style="">has a
</span>private benefit plan its Health, Welfare and Retirement Plan - which is
wholly company-financed because the employees do not contribute to its
maintenance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Company has integrated
its private plan with that of the Social Security system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It remitted to the latter the contributions
required of it for and in behalf of its employees - including the appellant
Rivera - but at the same time it has maintained its own private plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
that the Company's contributions to its private benefit plan are greater than
that required of it under the Social Security Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has, therefore, the right to deduct its
contributions to the System from the benefits accruing to its employees under
its private plan."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this portion of the opinion explaining why a reduction was proper:
"In the case at bar, the total of the retirement benefits due to Rivera
under the private plan of the Company was P1, 261.75.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since the latter had paid the amount of
P331.40 as its contribution to the Social Security System for and in behalf of
Rivera, it has therefore the right to deduct the latter amount from the total
amount of the retirement benefits, leaving a balance of P930.35, which latter
sum was paid to Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the
Company would be paying to the System and to its private plan, both for the
benefit of Rivera, the total amount of P1, 593.15 - a fact situation not
envisaged by the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> section <span style="">9 </span>(of the Social Security Act) which
emphatically stresses 'that the employer's total contribution to his private
benefit plan and to the Social Security System <u>shall be the same</u> as his
contribution to his private plan before the compulsory coverage.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The holding was further fortified in a resolution denying a
motion for reconsideration where this Court, again in an opinion by Justice
Castro, in rejecting the contention that the aforesaid section 9 of the Social
Security Act does not <span style="">authorize the
reduction of retirement benefit upon retirement or at any time but only and
immediately upon the integration of the private plan with the System, explained
why: "A searching scrutiny of the aforementioned section fails to elicit
any support for the appellant's contention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The section merely commands, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
(1) the integration of private plans with the System's plan, and (2) in case
the employer's contributions to his private plan are more than those required
of him under the Social Security Act, the payment by him to the System of the
contributions required of him, and the continuation of the payment of his contributions
to the private plan <u>less</u> his contributions to the System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no express or implied mention of the
need to make an </span><u><span style="">immediate
deduction</span></u><i><span style=""> </span></i><span style="">of his contribution to the System from his
contributions to the private plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would seem that this right to effect deduction, granted by law to the employer,
can be exercised by the latter at his leisure but before payment to the
employee of what is due to the latter under the private plan."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> To lend further emphasis to what was held,
it was stressed in the resolution: "And this is as it should be - for to
compel the employer to make the deduction every time he pays the required
premiums to the System, would be to constrain him to adopt and maintain a
cumbersome accounting procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely,
our lawmakers did not intend nor envision this possible inconvenience to the
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, where a right is
granted, whatever is necessary for the proper and effective exercise of said
right is presumed to have been granted likewise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Else, the right becomes inutile."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is doctrinal justification, then, for this assignment of
error, and petitioner must prevail.</p>

<blockquote>3. So the Court would rule, except for the writer of this opinion,
inclined as he is to have <span style="">a </span>reexamination of the Rivera doctrine so that the matter before
us could be inquired into freed from the compulsion that its authoritative
character imposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This suggestion is
made in view of the ambiguity lurking in the very same Section 9 of the Social security
Act, one of its provisos precisely prohibiting any discontinuance, reduction or
impairment of any benefit already earned thus giving rise to the vested right
argument relied upon by the then Solicitor-General Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, now a member of this Court, on behalf of
respondent Commission to sustain the challenged resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is even more persuasive to the writer's
way of thinking is the mandatory character of the social justice principle with
its embodiment of <span class="SpellE">Radbruch's</span> theory of subordination,
which if <span style="">applied to labor-management </span>relations
would entitle the claims of the former to priority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Serious misgivings assail him then as to the
desirability of a doctrine which, while on its face admittedly is buttressed on
logical grounds and not offensive to the sense of fairness if the traditional
assumption be indulged in that the scales between employer and employee are
evenly balanced, still may not be in conformity with the philosophy on which
the social justice mandate rests.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For it was rightly observed, in connection with an opinion
holding that temporary employees fall within the coverage of the Social
Security Act, that such a principle should mean that "they who have less
in life should be given more in law."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
To be more specific, where the right to a pension earned after years of
diligent performance is concerned, it would be, for the writer, an unwarranted
deprivation keenly felt if a diminution of what admittedly is not <span style="">a </span>munificent
sum is allowed, especially so in these days when inflation apparently cannot be
held in check.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fortunately for petitioner, the Court, to repeat, is of a
different mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence <span style="">the </span>controlling
force to be accorded to Rivera v. San Miguel Brewery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's appeal must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of respondent Commission of
January 11, 1966 is reversed and set aside, and the petition filed by private
respondents with respondent Commission contesting the deductions made from
their monthly retirement pension plans by petitioner is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

Section 5 of the Social Security Act <span style="">as </span>last amended by Republic Act No. 4857
(1966) reads as follows: "[Sec.] 5. <u><span style="">Settlement of Claims.</span></u><span style="">
-</span><span style=""> </span>(a) Any dispute arising
under this Act with respect to coverage, entitlement to benefits, collection
and settlement of premium contributions and penalties thereon, or any other
matter related thereto, shall be cognizable by the Commission, and any case
filed with the Commission with respect thereto shall be heard by the
Commission, or any of its members, or by hearing officers duly authorized by
the Commission, and decided within twenty days after the submission of the
evidence. The filing, determination and settlement of claims shall be covered
by the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission." Cf.

Cf. <span class="SpellE">Angara</span> <i>v</i>. Electoral Commission 63 Phil.
139 (1936). The instances cited by Justice Laurel', who wrote the opinion for
the Court, are the power of the President to approve or disapprove legislation,
his veto how­ever being subject to be overridden; his power to convene the
legislative body in special sessions; the power in turn of the latter to
confirm or reject Presidential appointments; its power not only to apportion
the jurisdiction of the courts but to determine what funds to appropriate for
their support; its power to impeach certain officials; and lastly as far as the
judiciary is con­cerned, its power of judicial review enabling it to annul
executive or legislative acts.</p>

so flexible and practical, so largely a " matter of sensible approximation
as the separation of powers."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the main with the opinion of Justice Fernando.</p>

<p class="BODY">I wish to add that the reduction of respondents-employees'
retirement benefits <u>under the private plan</u> for Pensions and Death Benefits
exclusively maintained by petitioner-employer since 1952 (before the enactment
on June 18, 1954 of Republic Act No. 1161, imposing compulsory social security
coverage and long before the actual implementation of September 1, 1957 of the
Social Security Act after its amendment on June 21, 1957 by Republic Act No.
1792) is a direct result of the mandatory integration of the private benefit
plan with the Social Security System plan as imposed by the Act. But over-all,
respondents-employees are not prejudiced by such reduction due to the mandatory
integration of the private plan with the System's plan under section 9 of the
Act and the cor­ollary mandate thereof that "where the employers'
contribution to his private plan is <u>more</u> than that required of him in
this Act, he shall pay to the System only the contribution required of him and <u>he
shall continue his contributions to such private plan less his contribution to
the System</u> so that <u>the employers' total contribution to his Private
benefit plan and to the Social Security System</u> shall be <u>the same</u> as
his contribution to his private plan <u>before </u>the compulsory
coverage."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This is evident from the figures given in the main opinion:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Parohinog's retirement pension under the private plan
was reduced by P29.99 from <u>P140.93</u> to P110.94 a month, but adding his
social security monthly pension from the System of P51.42, he was actually
receiving an increased total pension under the two plans of <u>P162.36</u> a
month;</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Castillo's private plan pension was reduced by P14.60<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
from <u>P49.50</u> to P34.90 a month, but with his additional social security
monthly pension of P25.00, he was actually receiving an increased total pension
under the two plans of <u>P59.50</u> a month; and</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span style="">Raymundo's
private plan pension was reduced </span>by P28.59 from <u>P120.14</u> to P91.55
a month, but with his additional social security monthly pension of P49.02, he
was actually receiving an increased total pension under the two plans of <u>P140.57</u>
a month.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1968 case of <u>Rivera vs. San Miguel Corporation,</u> penned
by Mr. Justice Castro, correctly laid down the doctrine, and properly applied
the clear and unambiguous provision of section 9 of the Act, that the
integration of an employer's private pension plan with the Social Security
System plan could not legally result in further increasing the employer's total
contribution to his private benefit plan <u>and</u> to the Social Security
System, in the face of the Act's express mandate that such total contribution
to <u>both</u> plans <u>"shall be the same </u>as his contribution to his
private plan <u>before</u> the compulsory coverage." The reduction in the
private plan pen­sion represents the employer's monthly contributions to the
System plan (which is not retained by the employer but is directly paid as the
employer's premium contribution to the System) and the sum total of such
contribution to the System <u>and</u> of the remaining contribution of the
employer to his private plan remains exactly the same as his contribution <u>solely</u>
to his private plan <u>before</u> the compulsory coverage, as ordained by
section 9 of the Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>Rivera</u> is therefore fully controlling in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And justly so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be readily seen that
petitioner-employer's con­tribution to its private benefit plan exclusively
maintained by it without any contribution from the employees and the resulting
private pentions paid by it (even though reduced to a certain extent
corresponding to the compulsory premium payment to the System plan) are still
much greater than those required of it under the Social Security System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>reduced</u> monthly pensions thus paid
by it under its private benefit plan, in the case of Parohinog and Raymundo,
amount to <u>double</u> their social security pensions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the Act by implication or
otherwise would warrant an inequitable construction in the name of abstract
social justice that would pen­alize a progressive and forward-looking employer
who has con<span style="">cretely
practiced social justice towards his employees by voluntarily and unilaterally
adopting and maintaining a <u>private</u> social security plan long before the
imposition by law of compulsory social security coverage and </span><span style="">require </span><span style="">the employer to
contribute to the compulsory plan of the System without deducting such contribution
from the remaining private plan, which the employer is required to continue
maintaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An analogous example of
such an unfair construction would be to require a non-agricultural employer
voluntarily paying an above-minimum daily wage of </span><span style="">P10.00 to employees without waiting for the
passage of <span style="">the recently enacted increased
minimum wage law fixing a minimum daily wage </span>of P8. 00 from P6.00, to
still pay the increased differential of <span style="">P2.00
besides the above-minimum daily wage </span>of P10.00 already being paid by the
employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The employer who has without compulsion of law taken the lead in
complying with the spirit of the Constitutional mandate to promote social
justice and in providing for social security against the hazards of disability,
<span style="">sickness, old age and death and thus </span>insuring
within his <span style="">capabilities the well-being
and economic </span>security of his employees<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
should not be inflicted the penalty of having to bear a greater economic burden
than that which he voluntarily assumed when he adopted his private plan, which
is more than that required of him under the Act, as indicated in Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Social Security Act recognizes this in
two of its provisos in section 9 thereof: (1) the second proviso "that
private plans which are existing and in force at the time of compulsory
coverage shall be integrated with the plan of the System in such a way that
where the employer's contribution to his <u>private plan is more than that
required of him in this Act</u>, he shall pay to the System only the
contribution required of him and he shall <u>continue his contributions to such
private plan less his contribution to the Sytem</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . , " such that where his contribution
to his private plan is <u>less</u> than that required of him in the Act, the
private plan is absolutely integrated, <span style="">or
</span>more accurately stated, <u>merged</u> into the System, and is
discontinued after due notice to the employees;<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) the fourth proviso "that the private benefit plan which the
employer shall continue for his employees shall remain under the employer's
management and control unless there is an existing agreement to the
contrary."</p>
