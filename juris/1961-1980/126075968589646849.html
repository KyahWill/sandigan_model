				<H3>PHILIPPINE PLYWOOD CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR UNION, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner, Philippine Plywood Corporation, hereinafter referred to as the 
Corporation, states in its petition herein that the same is one "for certiorari 
<i>as a special civil action</i>", because "the questions of law and facts" 
therein raised "would not be permissible in a petition for certiorari" as a 
means to secure a review on appeal, although it, likewise, avers that said 
petition "may also be treated by this Court as an appeal by certiorari".
<p>It is alleged in the petition that, in August 1950, thirty-seven (37) 
employees of the Corporation were dismissed for just causes; that, on January 4, 
1951, said employees moved for their inclusion as petitioners in Case No. 462-V 
of the Court of Industrial Relations, entitled "Plywood Labor Union-CLO 
<i>vs</i>. Philippine Plywood Corporation", which was begun on July 7, 1950; 
that, for reasons of expediency, the title of the case of said employees was 
changed to "National Labor Union <i>vs</i>. Philippine Plywood Corporation", and 
docketed as Case No. 553-V; that after due hearing and consideration of the 
evidence submitted, judgment was rendered on October 22, 1958, declaring that 
most of the aforementioned employees had been dismissed without just cause and 
directing their reinstatement, some with three (3) years backpay, others with 
back wages, from their respective dates of dismissal, minus the earnings they 
may have had elsewhere, one without backpay, and declaring that the other 
employees had been dismissed for just cause; that, upon motion for 
reconsideration, said decision was affirmed by the Court sitting <i>en banc</i>; 
that the Court had gravely abused its discretion in holding that the first set 
of employees were dismissed without just cause, in allowing their reinstatement 
and awarding them backpay, and in concluding that some of them were not given 
separation pay; and that there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in 
the ordinary course of law. Based upon these allegations, the Corporation prayed 
that "a writ be issued nullifying and setting aside" said decision, and that, 
"instead, another one be issued: (1) holding that the dismissals" of the 
employees in question "were justified; (2) denying their reinstatement and 
backpay; (3) holding that the one-month separation pay given" to specified 
employees "were in lieu of one month's notice; and (4) awarding the other 
dismissed employees the corresponding one-month pay or <i>mesada</i>, in lieu of 
notice".</p>
<p>At the outset, we note that the resolution of respondent Court sitting <i>en 
banc</i>, denying the motion for reconsideration of the decision appealed from, 
was promulgated on January 30, 1959, and that, on March 11, 1959, the 
Corporation filed a notice stating that "it will appeal said decision to the 
Honorable Supreme Court, in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 103", which gives the aggrieved party "<i>ten (10) days 
from the date of the award, order or decision</i>" within which to "appeal 
therefrom to the Supreme Court of the Philippines by writ of certiorari". 
Considering that said notice was given forty (40) days after said date, and that 
the present petition for certiorari was filed on April 16, 1959, or over two (2) 
months after the expiration of said period of ten (10) days, it is clear that 
the case at bar cannot be considered as an appeal by certiorari, and must be 
dealt with only as a special civil action of certiorari.</p>
<p>As such special civil action, it is, however, devoid of merit. Indeed, there 
is no question that respondent Court had jurisdiction over the aforementioned 
Case No. 553-V, as well as over the parties therein. The task of said Court was 
to ascertain the true cause of the dismissal of the employees involved in the 
case and to deter mine whether such cause was just or not. Both parties 
introduced their respective proof thereon, with the result that the issue 
narrowed down to which one of the two (2) sets of evidence thus appearing on 
record reflected the truth. After carefully analizing said evidence in a 58-page 
decision, Judge Tabigne of respondent Court reached the conclusion, which was 
shared by the Court sitting <i>en banc</i>, that the evidence for the 
petitioners therein was more reliable than that of the Corporation, that most of 
said employees had been dismissed by the general manager of the Corporation 
merely because they were involved in certain charges preferred against him and, 
accordingly, without just cause, and that the one-month pay given to some of 
them was an advance salary, not separation pay. Whether the lower court should 
have given more credence to the evidence for the Corporation or not is a matter 
that does not connote an abuse of discretion, much less a grave one, to warrant 
the relief for which the special civil action of certiorari is intended, 
particularly considering that the Corporation could have availed itself of the 
remedy of appeal by certiorari, and that the same would have been a plain, 
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</p>
<p>What is more, we are satisfied that respondent Court was justified by the 
evidence of record in reaching the conclusions aforementioned. Thus, to mention 
only some of the most salient facts of the case, the Corporation has not even 
tried to explain why its General Manager dismissed all the aforementioned 
thirty-seven (37) employees—who belonged to different departments—in August 
1950, or shortly after the filing, on July 18, 1950, of an administrative 
complaint charging him with several irregularities ranging from theft of 
property of the Corporation to immorality with female employees thereof, 
involving abuse of authority—although the acts or omissions imputed to said 
employees as justification for their dismissal had taken place long before. For 
instance, it is claimed that Lorenzo Aldana had committed a series of errors in 
the performance of his duties as chief mechanic. These alleged errors were 
committed, however, while he was working for the Corporation from March to June, 
1949. Yet, he was re-employed in February 1950 and was not dismissed until 
August 31, 1950, a few weeks after the filing of the aforementioned complaint 
against him. Then, again, the Corporation alleges that some of the main 
employees dismissed had connived among themselves to bring clown its production 
with a view to paving the way for the removal of its general manager. As stated 
in the decision appealed from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * It should be noted that in August, 1950, while the number of logs 
delivered was only 37,288 bd. ft., it processed 54,441 bd. ft. with a total 
output of 5,375 sheets of plywood finished (Exhibit 'Q'). In July, 1950, while 
the number of logs delivered was 114,819 bd. ft., it processed l45,847 bd. ft. 
with a total output of 11,777 sheets of plywood finished (Exhibit 'p'). In 
September, 1950, while the number of logs delivered was 138,139 bd. ft., it 
processed 137,617 bd. ft. with a total output of 8,217 sheets of plywood 
finished (Exhibit 'R'). From the foregoing comparative statements, it is clear 
that there was lack of logs delivered as well as processed in August, 1950, 
causing naturally to the low production of finished plywood for the same period, 
compared with those produced in July, 1950 in relation with the number of logs 
delivered and processed. It should also be observed that in September, 1950, as 
computed with that of July and August, 1950, the number of logs delivered 
exceeded the number of logs processed, which goes to show that there was 
sufficient supply of logs for said month. In July and August, 1950, the number 
of logs delivered, aside from being low, was less than the number of logs 
processed (See Exhibit 'R'). Likewise, the lack of sun dried veneers due to the 
rainy season contributed also to the low production of plywood in August, 1950. 
Manager Espinosa admitted that the low production of plywood in October, 1950 
might have been due to the rainy season, considering that some veneers were 
dried under the sun (t.s.n. p. 24, November 9, 1951)".</p></blockquote>
<p>It may not be amiss to add that the aforementioned charges against the 
general manager were apparently preferred upon the behest of a ranking officer 
of the Corporation—who was seemingly at logger heads with its General 
Manager—and under promise of immunity from disciplinary action. In other words, 
we are inclined to agree with counsel for respondent union that the employees 
adverted to above were merely caught in by the cross-fire produced by an 
intramural conflict between members of the management, which eventually ended in 
the withdrawal of the ranking officer aforementioned, thus leaving said 
employees at the mercy of the general manager, who from accused turned to be the 
accuser and judge at the same time.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition herein is dismissed and the writ prayed for denied, 
with costs against the Philippine Plywood Corporation. It is so 
ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L.,
