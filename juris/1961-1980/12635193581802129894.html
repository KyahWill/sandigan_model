				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present administrative case is for the dis­barment of respondent,
Leon P. <span class="SpellE">Gellada</span>, a member of the Philippine Bar, upon
a verified petition filed with this Court by petitioners <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> and Foster C. Howell on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The charges are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Representation of respondent in one and the same
case despite conflicting and antagonistic claims, without the consent of any
and all of the parties affected in said case, thus creating dissension and
conflicts between the two estates, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the Estate of the late Charles Newton Hodges in Special Proceedings No.
1672 and the.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges in Special Proceedings No. 1307, both
pending before the Court of First Instance of Iloilo.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unauthorized
representation in a case despite his relief as counsel and unethically persisting
on appearing in said case by himself and through his newly ap­pointed
assistants who replaced his former assistants and who were previously relieved
together with him.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
unethical solicitation of cases from the heirs of the late Charles Newton Hodges
after his relief as counsel for the administrator of said estate, writing
several maudlin letters, some bordering in libel, slandering his brother
counsel, especially those who are already in the case and who replaced him in
the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent filed his answer to the petition, deny­ing the
averments therein and putting up a number of affirmative defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1967</st1:date> this Court referred the case to
the Solicitor Gen­eral for investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under date of <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1971</st1:date> the Solicitor General submitted his
report wherein, after discussing the evidence pre­sented by the parties, both
oral and documentary, and making an extensive statement of facts found by him
to have been established by such evidence, he presents a resume thereof
together with his own conclusions.</p>

<blockquote>"In a nutshell, the grounds for respon­dent's disbarment as
prayed for can be clas­sified into three main categories:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Representation of conflicting interests, (2)
unauthorized representation in a case, and (3) unethical solicitation of cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anent the first ground the following facts appear to be
incontrovertible:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The spouses Charles N. Hodges and <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span>
Jane Hodges, American citizens, died on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="12">December 25, 1962</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1957</st1:date>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as respon­dent had been their
retained counsel be­fore the last war and until their death, respondent filed a
petition before the Court of First Instance of Iloilo (Spe­cial Proceedings No.
1307) for the pro­bate of the will of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane
Hodges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The will was admitted to probate
and Charles N. Hodges was appointed adminis­trator and later executor of the
estate of his deceased spouse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, upon the death of Charles N. Hodges, respondent instituted
Special Proceedings 1672 before the same Court for the probate of his
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> was appointed spe­cial <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate of Charles N. Hodges with Harold Davies as co-administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the relief of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of the
estate of C. Hodges, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> was appointed
co-administrator, and subsequently the latter was replaced by Joe Hodges, who
in turn was replaced by the PCI Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both wills were prepared, acknowledged and notarized by Respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to the estate of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane
Hodges, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> was appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> upon the death of Charles N. Hodges.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent was counsel for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
in her capacity as <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges and was also counsel for Charles N.
Hodges as administrator of the estate of his deceased wife, and later of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> as co-administrator of Harold Davies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1964</st1:date>, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span> and Raul <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span> entered
their appearance (Exhibit 42) as counsel for pe­titioner <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> in her capacity as <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>
of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, respondent was no longer
counsel for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>, co-administrator of the
estate of C. N. Hodges, as he filed a notice of withdrawal of his appearance on
<st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1963</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1964</st1:date>,
a Motion (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D &amp; 4) was filed in both Special
Proceedings for the purpose of effecting a settlement of part of the
controversies existing in the administration of both estates, which provided

<blockquote>Petitioners contend that in acting as counsel for C. N. Hodges,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> and Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, he represented conflicting interests in the
estates of both spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention
is premised on the argument that respondent entertained the theory that upon
the death of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges, her husband,
Charles, succeeded to her entire estate to the exclusion of the brothers and
sisters of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges, so much so that the
latter were prejudiced in their rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent on the other hand, has vehemently denied such allegation
and alleges that the said theory only came about when Attys. <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, Gibbs and <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span> entered
their appearance for some of the heirs of Charles Hodges, who claimed the
entire estate of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges on account of
which respondent withdrew as counsel for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The records show that as early as <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1963</st1:date>, respondent filed a notice of withdrawal as
counsel for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
3) whereas Attys. <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, Gibbs and <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span> first appeared as counsel for PCIB, administrator of
the estate of C. N. Hodges in 1964.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, it could not be possible that the withdrawal of respondent
as counsel for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> was allegedly due to the
theory of Attys. <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, Gibbs and <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span> that the heirs of C. N. Hodges succeeded to the
whole estate of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that both wills provided
that upon the death of either spouse, the surviving spouse shall succeed to the
entirety of the estate of the deceased.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> Obviously this provision gave rise
to various interpretations on the part of petitioners, the heirs to both
estates, their respective counsel, and re­spondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, such interpretation is a matter of
opinion, the validity of which is presently under litigation in the special
proceedings adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
evidence is bereft of any finding that the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span>
Jane Hodges and Charles Hodges were unduly prejudiced by the appearance of
respondent as counsel for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, and Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, Joe Hodges, an heir of Charles N. Hodges and his counsel, J. A.
Hodges, Louise Hodges, and the Higdon family, all of whom are heirs of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges, through their respective counsel,
signed the Motion dated <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="1">January 24,
 1964</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D &amp; 4), showing their
conformity to the fees for services rendered by respondent and the cases in
which respondent shall continue as counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, in a pleading dated December 17, 1964 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
28) petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> agreed to respondent's claim for
additional compensation considering the value of the estate and
"considering further, the amount of compensation already paid to Atty.
Allison J. Gibbs, who is comparatively new in this case." In this
connection it is well-settled that the duties of an administrator of an es­tate
is to assemble the properties of the es­tate, pay the debts, and distribute the
resi­due among the heirs entitled thereto in accor­dance with the orders of a
competent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These, precisely were
the duties of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges’ estate and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> as administrator of C. N. Hodges’ estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such they did not assume any interest
adverse to that of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges
and Charles N. Hodges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same can be
said of respondent, as counsel for both <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
and co-administrator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If ever respondent filed suits against Joe Hodges and Howard
Hodges, heirs of Charles Hodges, and Era Bowman and Emma Howell, heirs of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges, they were in pursuance of his claim for
attorneys fees for services rendered and damages suffered by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These suits have no relation whatsoever to
the es­tates in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore
when these cases were filed, respondent was no longer representing any of the administrators
or heirs of both estates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been established by the evidence appearing on record that
upon the filing by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> of the
"Manifestation" dated <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="6">June
 15, 1964</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) relieving re­spondent
and his associates (<span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mediodia</span>)
as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges, by Attys. <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, who are
also counsels for the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges,
the respondent and said associates never appeared as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> or the heirs
of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, neither he nor his associates
could be held liable for unauthorized representation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts of respondent pertinent to this
charge had only to do with the filing of a Motion to hold in abeyance the
Manifestation and Urgent Motion of Attys. <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span> (Exhibit 5) until the court resolves the
motion he filed to fix and approve the attorney's fees of <span class="SpellE">Gellada</span>
and Associates in the estate of <span class="SpellE">Linnie</span> Jane Hodges (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
because respondent continued to receive Notices for hearing, pleadings and
orders from the Court, he appeared before the Court not as counsel for any of
the parties in both estates, although he believed that he was still responsible
for the proper conduct of the case, but to apprise the Court of his improper
relief and the substitution of new lawyers who have taken over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appearance of Attys. Norberto de la Cruz
and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Gellada</span> who took over from Attys.
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Mediodia</span>
were in connection with paragraph (f) of the Motion dated January 24, 1964
(Exhibits D and 4) previously mentioned, which were agreed upon by the
petitioners, the heirs and counsels of both estates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent was counsel for Fernando <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>,
co-administrator of the estate of C. N. Hodges until <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1963</st1:date>, when he filed his notice of
withdrawal as counsel (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged letters of respon­dent to Jose
Hodges of <st1:place><st1:city>Lubbock</st1:city>, <st1:state>Texas</st1:state></st1:place>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. T) dated <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1963</st1:date> and to J. A. Hodges, dated <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1963</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
U) are immaterial insofar as the charge for unethical solicita­tion of cases
from the heirs of the late Charles Hodges are concerned, because said letters
were written while respondent was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>still
counsel for <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to the letter purportedly sent by respondent to Mr. and Mrs. J. A.
Hodges, the latter replied that they did not wish respondent to resign as
estate lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as regards the letter
by respondent to Atty. Clinton of Texas, counsel of J. A. Hodges, it was
established that it was not to solicit cases from some of the heirs, but was in
answer to Clinton's letter asking how much fees respondent would charge in
representing them, to which respondent answered that he was not particular
about his fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, there is no
showing that respondent's services as counsel for any of the parties were
engaged after he wrote the alleged "solicitation letters" and neither
did respondent appear as counsel for any of the parties of both estates after
he was relieved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is to be noted that because of this disbarment proceeding the
special proceedings in both estates have been suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is true with Civil Case No. 6886
(Exhibit 44) entitled Leon P. <span class="SpellE">Gellada</span> vs. Era Bowman,
et al.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would like to mention in
passing that parts of the testimonial evidence and some pleadings have been
marked with unsavory remarks and offensive language engendered by personal
ill-feelings of counsel of both parties toward each other, which ought to have
been carefully avoided as these have unnecessarily delayed proceedings of the cases
filed by their respective clients.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is a well-settled rule that in disbarment proceedings, the
burden of proof rests upon the complainant and for the Court to exercise its
disciplinary powers, the case against the respondent must be established by convincing
proof (Go vs. <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>, Adm. Case No. 736, Octo­ber 23,
1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as held in one case, the
power to disbar attorneys ought always to be exercised with great caution, and
should follow only where there is a clear preponderance of evidence against the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the presumption is - an
attorney is innocent of the charges pre­pared and has performed his duty as an
officer of the court in accordance with his oath (Re <span class="SpellE">Reily</span>,
7 ALR 89 cited in <span class="SpellE">In</span> Re <span class="SpellE">Tionko</span>,
43 Phil. 191).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>We submit that the evidence adduced is insufficient to justify the
disbarment or suspension from the practice of law of respondent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have gone over the record and are of the opinion that the
foregoing findings and conclusions insofar as the actuations of respondent are
concerned, have been fully established.</p>
