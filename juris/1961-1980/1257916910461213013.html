				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by writ of error from two orders denying similar petitions to set 
aside analogous judgments in the above entitled cases, upon the ground of 
mistake and excusable negligence.
<p>On August 3, 1959, separate judgments were rendered in Civil Cases No. Q-3600 
and Q-3611 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal (L-16668 and L-16669 of this 
Court) ordering the respective defendants therein, and all other persons 
claiming under each, to vacate two (2) lots of about 200 square meters each, 
situated in the barrio of North Tatalon, Quezon City, forming part of a bigger 
parcel of land known as Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision and covered by Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 1267, which, in turn, originated from Original 
Certificate of Title No. 735, issued in 1914, both in the name of plaintiff J. 
M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., and to remove the house and other constructions on 
said lots, and sentencing the defendants in each case to pay the plaintiff P60 a 
month from the date on which said defendants had been found to have usurped the 
possession of said lots until such time as plaintiff shall have been restored in 
such possession, and the costs. Almost three months later, or on October 28, 
1959, said defendants filed separate petitions to set aside the aforementioned 
judgments, upon the ground that their failure to be present at the hearing of 
their respective cases on July 31, 1959, was due to mistake and excusable 
negligence, and that they had a good and valid defense, as set forth in the 
affidavits attached to said petitions. Upon denial thereof, both defendants 
interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the two cases are identical, except as to the caption, title and 
number thereof, as well as the name of the defendants and the particular lot 
involved in each, plaintiff was allowed to file only one brief in reply to the 
separate briefs of said defendants. For the same reason, both cases will be 
jointly disposed of in this decision.</p>
<p>Appellants maintain that the lower court had abused its discretion in issuing 
the order appealed from, but we find no merit in such pretense. As stated in 
said order, defendants' motion for postponement of the hearing, scheduled to 
take place on July 31, 1959, was filed on that same date. Likewise, the motion 
for postponement—which has not been included in the records on appeal—was based 
upon the allegation that Jeremias Meris, one of the attorneys for the 
defendants, had become voiceless due, presumably, to a severe cold and the 
strain in his voice during a preliminary investigation the previous day. Yet no 
medical certificate was attached to said motion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact of illness must be established by some satisfactory sworn 
statement, either in the shape of an <i>affidavit or the certificate of a 
physician</i> that satisfies the court of the inability of the party to be 
present." (Natividad vs. Marquez, 38 Phil., 608)</p></blockquote>
<p>What is more, copy of said motion was not served on the plaintiff. Again, the 
records show that defendants-appellants were, and still are represented by two 
sets of lawyers, namely, Attorney Jeremias Meris and the law firm Asuncion, 
Bulos, Revilla &amp; Associates. The alleged indisposition of Atty. Meris could 
not have prevented, at least, a member of said law firm, from appearing on 
behalf of said defendants.</p>
<p>Lastly, defendants' defenses were, allegedly, (1) adverse possession for over 
50 years, (2) nullity of plaintiff's title, upon the ground that the same had 
been obtained by fraud and, (3) that the lots in question were not embraced in 
said title. Considering, however, that the latter was derived from an original 
certificate of title issued in 1914, it is obvious that the first two defenses 
are absolutely untenable. Moreover, defendants' affidavits are clearly 
insufficient to establish <i>prima facie</i> that their third defense is 
meritorious, apart from the fact that the evidence introduced at the hearing of 
these cases disproved it.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders appealed from are hereby affirmed, with costs against 
defendants-appellants. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
