<p class="BODY">The night of <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4">April 22,
 1963</st1:date> found Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> alone in his house
located in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Macalang</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dasol</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Province</span></st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For his wife, <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
Molino, was <span class="GramE">at</span> a nearby barrio attending a benefit dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="SpellE">protege</span>,
14-year old <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> Villanueva, was playing cards in
another house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neighbors were summoned
by Jose's cries for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They saw him
in a serious condition with a bullet wound between the anus and the
testicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was dead before medical
help could be summoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A medico-legal
necropsy report filed by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Liceralde</span>, Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Infanta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, described the wound as a
"penetrating wound admitting the tip of the forefinger at the right aspect
of the scrotum partly hitting the right testicle, <span class="SpellE">conminuted</span>
fracture of the anterior <span class="SpellE">ramus</span> of the pelvic bone,
right side; massive <span class="SpellE">hemoperitoneum</span>, one and one-half
(1 1/2) liters to two (2) liters; perforations of the small intestines, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> no gun powder burns."
Cause of death, so Dr. <span class="SpellE">Liceralde</span> reported, was
"shock due to massive internal hemorrhage." A slug was located at the
<span class="SpellE">anterio</span>-inferior aspect of the right kidney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not, however, produced in court; it
was lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By April 23, the manhunt was
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Investigations were conducted. It
was only on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1963</st1:date>
that criminal prosecution was started with a complaint for murder against
defendant filed by PC Sgt. Pablo Jimenez.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The People's case was
built upon evidence following:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Ricardo</u> <u>Villanueva</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The People would want to show, by the testimony of this witness, that on
the night in question, he went out fishing; that on his return, he passed by
the fence at the gate of the house of the deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>;
that at a distance of thirty meters, he noticed <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, brothers, the former peeping into the <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> home, with the latter looking around; that to
observe them he hid under a <span class="SpellE">camarin</span> some seven meters
from where <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> stood; that <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
moved apart the outer wall of the house made of coconut leaves, inserted a
short gun and fired a shot inside; that together, the brothers <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> ran, and <span style="">that
</span>he, too, took to his heels in fright.</p>

<p class="BODY">The story given by this witness would have meant much for the
People's <span class="GramE">case were</span> it believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But is it?</p>

<p class="BODY">Ricardo Villanueva, who used to live in the house of the deceased
Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>, is the father of 14-year old <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> Villanueva heretofore mentioned, who, at the time
of the incident here involved, was living with the said Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> and his wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Right from the start, Ricardo Villanueva was one of the suspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after the ninth day of prayer, he was
investigated by the Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
then that he told the Constabulary that he <u>knew</u> <u>nothing</u> about
Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella's</span> murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He gave as reason that at the time of the commission thereof, he was in
the hills some four kilometers away from the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, in the following July, when he was
called upon by the Fiscal to shed light on the case, he testified that he
really was present at the commission of the offense as he had heretofore
described.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, the
disquieting note that he admitted to the Fiscal having told the Constabulary
that he had no knowledge of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Interesting it is to note that by his own admission, what he
allegedly witnessed that evening he kept to himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He breathed not a word; not to his wife, not
to his neighbors, not even to the widow of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made one exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He related the incident to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>, uncle of the deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>,
in July.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>,
the record discloses, was the moving spirit behind the prosecution of appellant
and who engaged the services <span style="">of </span>a
private prosecutor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explains why
witness Ricardo Villanueva was belatedly included in the list of witnesses
enumerated in the information before the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is no wonder then that the lower court rejected Villanueva as
unbelievable.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
For, indeed, he does not play it straight with truth.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Anselmo</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Villaruz</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness, as is Ricardo Villanueva, does
not appear as such in the criminal complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is he listed in the information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was described in the record as a surprise witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
For, during the several investigations conducted to ferret out the killer, the
name of this witness was never mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He declared that about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1963</st1:date>,
he boarded a <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> bus in <span class="SpellE">Eguia</span>,
bound for <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bayambang</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span><st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Infanta</span></st1:placename></st1:place>), which was four
kilometers away, to attend a prayer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon returning home some three hours afterwards, and reaching a
crossing, he defecated at the edge of the road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was then that he heard a gun report coming from the west where the
house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> was, about three hundred meters
away from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the gunfire, he saw
the accused <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>
and his brother <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>
running towards the east.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was three
meters more or less from them when he recognized them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Subsequently,
</span>he went home.</p>

<p class="BODY">Witness <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span> lived in another
barrio, namely, barrio <span class="SpellE">Eguia</span>, in the same <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dasol</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted that he used to go to the house of the deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> and that he knew the accused <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> since childhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strangely enough, he told the court that he
first learned of the death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> only in
July 1963, when he went to the house of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>
who told him to see Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, the private
prosecutor in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is rather
odd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>News of murder, like the one under
consideration, spreads among barrio folks like wildfire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As with the other witness, Ricardo
Villanueva, <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span>
never communicated to anyone what he claimed he heard and saw that night of the
murder until he revealed the same to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, the most that can be inferred from
the evidence produced by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Anselmo</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span> </span>is that, if true, defendant and his brother
<span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> were placed near the scene of the crime under
suspicious circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This belated
revelation and a similar version as belatedly given by the other witness
Ricardo Villanueva must have accounted for the fact that <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> was not and never was included in the crimÂ­inal
charge with his brother, defendant <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not a credible witness, <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span> should be knocked off as a prop to the case for
the prosecution.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the prosecution
did not stop with the two witnesses just mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number of other witnesses <span style="">were </span>brought to court in an effort to
weave a tight web of circumstantial evidence on which apparently is pinned the
hope <span style="">that </span>appellant should not
escape unpunished.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first was that testified to by <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
Molino, brother-in-law of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His version was that defendant wanted to bury the deceased with the
clothes used at the time of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
which said witness objected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Molino
suggested that the accused seek the help of the PC and the NBI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Molino, defendant waved this off
with the statement that it was difficult to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Molino came up with the testimony that
the accused told him to stop looking for the killer of Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>,
otherwise his (Molino's) life would be in danger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact, however, is that it was this
witness himself who brought the clothes used by the deceased consisting of a
shirt, underwear, a pair of pants, blanket and a bag to the municipal
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version was contradicted
by defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Molino, so defendant
claims, could not have been without motive in declaring against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because one <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
in the care of Molino was transferred to defendant by the latter's deceased
father-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then <span class="GramE">came</span> Pedro Alpena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abella</span> gave in
court the story that during the burial on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1963</st1:date>, it was suggested that <span style="">the body of the deceased be turned face
downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, superstiÂ­tion had it that
if the killer were a stranger, the latter would not be able to get away and
could </span>easily <span style="">be identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, a high school graduate, was
credited with having objected to this and having stated that those who wanted
could do so if they did not pity him (the accused).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done, and allegedly the accused
fainted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A third circumstance happened on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5">the 23rd of May 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was testified to by <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez and <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wife of <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
Ramirez and the wife of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> hereto<span style="">fore mentioned were sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span>, upon the other hand, was an uncle of the deceased
Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>, although the accused was a nephew of <span class="SpellE">Mirador's</span> wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ramirez declared that on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, he dropped in at the house of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span> to borrow lead
for catching fish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was
talking to <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span> and he remembered the accused make
the following statement:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If it is
possible <span class="SpellE">Manong</span> I would surrender so that my younger
brother and my mother-in-law will not be included." To which <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span> answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If you do not like your brother and
mother-in-law to be included you better surrender yourself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio's</span>
turn to tell the accused in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"If you </span>will <span style="">surrender
you surrender now and I will accompany you." The accused replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, I will do <span class="SpellE">Manong</span>
but I have no gun with which to surrender.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If possible you go and look for a gun which is cal. 32.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will buy it or change it with <span class="SpellE">palay</span> or rooster." <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez went
out ostensibly to look for a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
about two hours, the two returned empty-handed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez prodded defendant to
surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> replied:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"You wait first I am going to consult my lawyer." <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez told the accused as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That could be done but you must
return." On May 26, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez returned to
the house of <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>
to inquire about the result of his mission in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the reply of <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>
was that his lawyer, <span class="SpellE">Marceliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Urbano</span>,
warned him that he would just be hanging himself if he did so; and forthwith he
offered to settle the case amicably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing version was
confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Continuing, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Ramirez told the court that in June of the same
year, he was sent for by the accused <span class="GramE">who</span> was then in the
municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Dasol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter requested him not </span>to <span style="">testify, in this case, to which he allegedly
declined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coincidentally, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span> also testified
that on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">,
he was fetched by the wife of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taken to the municipal building, witness was there requested by
defendant not to testify against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant added that the evidence was weak and that he would fight the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Receiving a negative answer, </span>the
<span style="">accused was reported to have stated
that the witness should pity him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All the imputations
heretofore related were vehemently denied by defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the witnesses for the prosecution
heretofore related ever mentioned the fact that defendant </span>admitted
directly <span style="">having committed the crime of
murder against </span>his father-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>In</u> <u>fact</u><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ambrosio</u></span><span style=""> </span><u>Ramirez</u><span style=""> </span><u>declared</u><span style=""> </span><u>that</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u><span style=""> </span><u>accused</u><span style=""> </span><u>did</u> <u>not</u><span style=""> </span><u>admit</u><span style=""> </span><u>having</u><span style=""> </span><u>killed</u><span style=""> </span><u>Jose</u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Abella</u></span><span style="">, </span><u>and</u><span style=""> </span><u>that</u><span style=""> </span><u>said</u><span style=""> </span><u>accused</u><span style=""> </span><u>merely</u><span style=""> </span><u>desired</u><span style=""> </span><u>to</u><span style=""> </span><u>surrender</u><span style=""> </span><u>because</u><span style=""> </span><u>he</u><span style=""> </span><u>was</u><span style=""> </span><u>under</u><span style=""> </span><u>suspicion</u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>transÂ­cript <span style="">of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
Ramirez on </span>cross-examination <span style="">on
this point reads -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact is, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, did not admit
to you that he killed Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir he only told me that he wanted to surrender, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And up to now, Mr. Witness, you do not know the reason why <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> ever said why
he wanted to surrender?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">I know, sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is the reason why he </span><span style="">wanted </span><span style="">to surrender?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since he is under <u>suspicion</u>, he wanted to surrender
himself so that his younger brother and his mother-in-law </span>will <span style="">not be included, sir."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It will be recalled that
the version given by the People's witnesses as to the offer of surrender was
qualified with the statement, "If it is possible".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This could be indicative of the fact that
defendant was not sure whether or not he should surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not be logically assumed that he
definitely was the author of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not escaping attention </span>is <span style="">the
statement witness Ramirez attributed to defendant that the latter demurred to
giving himself up because he (defendant) had no gun to surrender, </span><span style="">suggested </span>that <span style="">Ramirez and the other witness (<span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span>) look for </span>one, <span style="">and even offered to pay for it with money or <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
or rooster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Serious doubt is at once
created as to whether such unusual statement could have come from the lips of
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, if he did, this statement
could mean that really defendant was not the author of the </span>crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It
would have been an easy matter for him to say that </span>he could <span style="">not surrender any weapon because he had
thrown it </span>away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, that he would
try <span style="">to </span>look for the lethal <span style="">weapon - if he really did kill <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> with a gun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another thing is that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirador</span>, in his
testimony on rebuttal, betrayed an utter lack of veracity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony which follows is quite
revealing:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have you ever been a witness before in any
Court?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not yet, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
mean to say, this is the first time that you appear before a court of justice
to testify?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
was once, sir, but I was told of declaring which is not true, that is why, we
lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That time 1 was forced to declare
that we did not go inside the fence but, in fact, we went inside, so, we
lost."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing
circumstantial evidence sums </span>up the case <span style="">for the People.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No sufficient motive
there was for the son-in-law to murder his father-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The best that could be offered was that
related in court by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that in FebÂ­ruary 1963, the two quarreled
while Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> was threshing his <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> wanted to take over the threshing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then when "Jose <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> placed the nylon over the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is at this point that
we are reminded that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction
if:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(a) there is more than one
circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven;
and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a
conviction beyond reasonable doubt."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Directing our attention
to the third requisite, we find it difficult to bring ourselves to a conviction
that the State has proven </span>the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the assumption that the
statements attributed to appellant were true, such evidence does not rise above
the level of mere conjecture or suspicion of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pause and hesitate to declare a forfeiture
of defendant's liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His liability
has not been satisfactorily shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
innocence could be doubted, it is true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this does not exclude another or others as the author or authors of
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worthwhile it is to recall
that in order that circumstantial evidence may bring about <span class="GramE">conviction,</span>
all the circumstances must be consistent with the hypothesis that the accused
is guilty and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis that he is
innocent.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Pertinent, too, is a reaffirmaÂ­tion of the other precept that when <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts aid circumstances are capable of two
explanations, one consistent with innoÂ­cence and the other with guilt, such
evidence would not meet the test of moral certainty and would not support
conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Given the moral twilight between guilt and innocence, our duty is <span style="">plain:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>acquit.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the conclusion just reached, we need not look into
defendant's alibi - that since <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="4">April
 20, 1963</st1:date> he was out peddling 39 crates of mangoes and did not
return until the 23rd of April -to shore up his claim of innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason being that in a criminal
prosecution, the People must rely on the strength of its own evidence, not on
the weakness of the defense.</p>
