				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present suit is a special civil action for cer­tiorari with <span style="">preliminary injunction filed </span>by <span style="">Tahir Lida­</span><span style="">san, a </span><span style="">mayoralty candidate for Parang, Cotabato in the 1967 </span><span style="">elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged that on December <span style="">27, 1967 </span>the mu­<span style="">nicipal </span><span style="">board
of canvassers of Parang, Cotabato, met to canvass; that on December 28, 1967, </span>it
rejected the re­<span style="">turns of Precincts 15,
16, 23 and 24</span>0<span style=""> </span>on the
ground that these were obviously manufactured, applying the rule of statistical
probability in <u>Lagumbay <span style="">v. </span>Climaco</u>,
G.R. No. L-25444, January 310 <span style="">1966; </span>that
on <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="12">December <span style="">29, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>it
reversed itself, upon order of <span style="">the </span><span style="">Commission </span>on
Elections, stat­ing that the doctrine in the <u>Lagumbay</u> case does <span style="">not </span>apply to the returns in question
which did not contain 100% voting for one party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thus the municipal board of canvassers
counted said returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on the same
day, the <span style="">instant </span>action was
filed, to <span style="">assail </span>respondent Com­mission
on Elections' order to canvass the aforesaid re­turns and to declare all acts
and proceedings in connec­tion therewith null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">We required the respondents to answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission on Elections filed its answer on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January <span style="">8,
 </span>1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Sansaluna Biruar, the op­posing candidate, filed <span style="">his answer on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January 17, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After petitioner filed his reply, the case was set for hearing on
<st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Biruar; however, on January 29,
1968, filed a manifestation and mo­tion, stating that on January <span style="">9, </span>1968, petitioner filed an election
protest in the Court of First Instance of Cotabato against him, and thus, the
present case for certiorari should be dismissed for being moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, as required by <span class="GramE">Us</span>, filed his
comment thereto, which maintained that his protest expressly sta­ted that he
was not thereby abandoning the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1968</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">We</span> heard this case, as sche­duled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The protest filed by Tahir Lidasan, petitioner here­in, impugned
the results of the election, canvass and pro­clamation of the protestee,
Sansaluna Biruar, because, he alleged, in the elections, and election returns,
of Pre­cincts Nos. 14, 15, 16, 23 and 24 of Parang, Cotabato, terrorism, fraud,
anomalies, irregularities and other viola­tions of the election law, were
perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this it is evident
that petitioner has a sufficient remedy in the ordinary course of law, that <span style="">is, </span>the protest, considering that he
freely resorted to the same and that he has not shown, or even contended in the
record, that said remedy of protest is not speedy or adequate enough for the
purpose he seeks.</p>

<p class="BODY">A special civil action of certiorari does not lie where a plain
and speedy remedy lies in the ordinary course of law (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of
Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In filing the protest,
subsequent to the filing of this suit, petitioner has resorted to an ordinary
remedy in the course of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since a
litigant cannot avail of <u>both</u> a special civil ac­tion and an ordinary
remedy, the present action cannot prosper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming, even, that the protest is not speedy enough the
petition herein fails on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the hear­ing, petitioner's counsel made an offer of evidence of
pho­tostats to show the returns that he claimed were obviously
manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is sought to
prove that <span style="">in </span>the returns of the
precincts in question, petitioner obtained zero and respondent Biruar garnered
practically all the votes for mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
however appears and is admitted that, in the same returns, candidates of both
major parties, for other offices such as those of Senators, received a substan­tial
number of votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should also be
mentioned that the Court's attention was called to the fact that in other
precincts, the returns showed the reverse, that is, for mayor petitioner herein
got practically all the votes and respondent Biruar had zero.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that the doctrine in <u>Lagumbay</u> <span style="">finds no application herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For such </span><span style="">doctrine contem­</span><span style="">plated a
</span>situation <span style="">where there is shown
in the returns </span><u>totally 100% voting for </u><u><span style="">all</span></u><span style=""> the candidates
of one party and zero for those o the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said this Court therein:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It must be noted that this is not an instance wherein <u>one</u>
return gives to <u>one</u> can­didate all the <span style="">votes in </span>the precinct, even <span style="">as </span>it gives exactly <u>zero</u> to
the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not a case where <u>some</u><span style=""> </span>senatorial candidates <u>obtain zero</u>
exactly, while some others receive a few scattered votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, <u><span style="">all </span>the eight</u> candidates of one party garnered <span style="">all </span>the votes, all of them receiving <u>exactly
the same number</u>; whereas all the eight candidates of the other party got
precisely <u>nothing</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No grave abuse of discretion, therefore, was commit­ted in the
inclusion of the returns herein involved, in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for certiorari is hereby dis­missed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
