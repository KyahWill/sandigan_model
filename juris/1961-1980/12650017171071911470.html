<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On April 14, 1948, herein 
petitioners Lorenzo and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span> filed two 
complaints in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, 
one against respondents <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> (Civil 
Case No. 196), and the other against the Philippine Alien Property 
Administration and the Director of Lands (Civil Case No, 197), to have the deed 
of sale executed by their deceased father <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> to 
respondents <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Honganji</span> Mission, 
declared void on the ground that the land was a conjugal property of the spouses 
<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Feliza</span> Enriquez, and that there having been no 
liquidation and partition of the conjugal properties, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> had no right or authority to sell Lot No. 127 
without the knowledge and consent of his sons, petitioners herein, who became, 
together with their father, pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> owners 
thereof. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court dismissed the two 
cases, and upon appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 5148-R and 5149-R), 
the decision of the lower court, dismissing the complaint against the Director 
of Lands, was affirmed (CA-G.R. No. 5149-R): but said appellate court revoked 
the' decision of the trial court with respect to the defendants <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>, respondents herein, declaring them purchasers 
in bad faith. The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of said decision is 
hereunder reproduced: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'Wherefore, the judgment appealed 
from is affirmed in Civil Case 197 (CA-G.R. No. 5149-R) in so far as it denies 
recovery of lot sold to <span class="SpellE">Honganji</span> Mission; and reversed 
in so far as it upholds the validity of the sale to <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>. The latter and 
her husband Vicente <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>, are sentenced to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> Lot 127-A of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above decision having become 
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="2" month="11"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 
2, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioners herein filed a motion for execution thereof. The Sheriff's return 
stated that <span class="GramE">respondents</span> spouses <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>, refused to sign the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> presented to them by him. So, on 
</span><st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="11"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 29, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
petitioners filed a motion asking the trial court to appoint some other person 
to sign the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> (Sec 10, Rule 39). 
Respondents <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>, on 
December 17, 1955, filed a manifestation denominated by them 'For Record<span class="GramE">,’</span> claiming that the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> 
ordered by the Supreme Court of one-half of Lot 127-A, to be made by them in 
favor of petitioners, should be supported by a consideration in the sum of 
P400.00 and that the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> shall take effect 
only upon payment thereof. Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">Guinoos</span> 
submitted for the approval of the respondent Judge, a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, pertinent portion of which reads as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">'Now therefore, pursuant to the 
decision of the Supreme Court, above-quoted, and for and in consideration of the 
sum of Four Hundred Pesos (P40O.0O) Philippine Currency, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>, spouses, hereby <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to Lorenzo E. <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span> 
and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span> only one-half of Lot 127-A 
pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>, excluding the improvements thereon 
belonging to saw spouses <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioners on February 8, 
1956, objected to the petition, alleging (1) that in the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to be executed, no mention should be made of 
the P400.00 as consideration thereof, since no requirement to this effect is 
contained in the final decree of the Supreme Court; (2) that in the deed of 
<span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to be executed, the improvements on the 
lot to be <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> should not be excluded <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, as the Supreme Court in its decree not excluded 
said improvements; and (3) that a writ issued to place the petitioners herein in 
possession of one-half of Lot 127-A pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>, 
including the improvements thereon, as owners of said one-half portion. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On February 9, 1956, the 
respondent Judge issued an order declaring that the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> as submitted by the respondents was a 
substantial compliance with the writ of execution and that the Court should 
'abstain from making any ruling over the claim of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zuno</span> that in the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> his 
clients are entitled to receive P400.00 from the plaintiffs, which claim, may be 
raised when an opportune time comes.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In its order of April 18, 1956, 
clarifying the import of the expression "the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> had complied substantially with the writ of 
execution,' contained in its order of February 9, 1956, the lower court meant 
'the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of only one-half (1/2) of Lot No. 
127-A, without touching the improvements and consideration, which may be 
liquidated by the parties in a separate proceeding.' In the same order, the said 
court stated that it was not in a position to issue a writ of possession before 
the parties are entitled to the physical possession of the property owned 
pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> by them. In other words, the lower court 
disposed that the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> should be 
strictly in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court, sans 
consideration and improvements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners, therefore, filed 
this action for mandamus alleging that respondent Judge gravely abused his 
discretion and unlawfully neglected the performance of an act which was 
specifically enjoined upon him by law as a duty, playing therein that this 
Tribunal: (a) order the respondent Judge to cause the execution of the final 
decree of this Court by directing respondents spouses <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> to execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of one-half of Lot No. 127-A pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>, in favor of petitioners, without stating any 
consideration Monetary or otherwise; but including all the improvements existing 
on the property so <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>, and to declare the 
aforementioned Orders of the respondent Judge and the acts already done pursuant 
thereto, null and void; (b) order the respondent Judge to issue a writ to place 
petitioners in physical possession of Lot No. 127-A, including the improvements 
thereon as co-owner and co-possessors thereof, until a division is made; (c) 
order the respondent spouses, the <span class="SpellE">Guinoos</span>, to render 
an accounting of the rentals and other benefits they have derived from Lot No. 
127-A and the improvements thereon, since the filing of the complaint in Civil 
Case No. 196 and of such rentals and other benefits as they will derive until a 
division of the property is affected, to order the respondent spouses to pay to 
petitioners the sum of P1,000 as attorney's fees, and to pay the costs. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Answering, the respondents 
alleged: (a) that petitioners have other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in 
the ordinary course of Jaw; and (b) the action taken and the orders issued by 
the respondent Court were justified by the facts and the law on the case. They 
pray that the petition be denied, for lack of merit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The orders of the respondent 
Judge of </span><st1:date year="1956" day="9" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 9, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
</span><st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="4"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 18, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
were not interlocutory but final orders on the merits of the issues raised 
therein, and, therefore, <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>. The petitioners 
did not appeal from said orders. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date year="1956" day="20" month="8"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 
20, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the petitioners filed in the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Civil Case 
No. 2061 against herein respondents <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> and husband, for partition and recovery of rentals 
and damages (see pleadings in said case, Annexes 1 to 5 of the answer). In this 
Civil Case No. 2061, the issues as to improvements, the consideration as to 
<span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, the improvements and portion of the lot 
to be <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> are the same issues raised in the 
present mandamus proceedings. Having filed said Civil Case No. 2061 before a 
competent court which is clothed with jurisdiction over the case, the 
petitioners cannot now pretend, with any degree of plausibility, that they have 
no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The 
doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> now operates against them. 
Veritably, there is presently another action between the same parties involving 
the same subject matter and the same issues. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision of 
this Court in G.R. No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-5541, on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="25" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 25<span class="GramE">,1955</span></span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, is simple and plain. It 
sentenced <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> 
‘to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> one-half of </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lot</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> No. 127-A to Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span> and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span>,' without pronouncement as to the improvements 
thereon, and as to whether or not the herein petitioner should restore to 
respondents <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span>, the consideration paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>. <span class="GramE">So, also with the Court of 
Appeals.</span> In Civil Case No. 196, CFI, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, 
there was no allegation or prayer for the improvements; they claim only 1/2 of 
Lot No. 127-A and reasonable compensation or rentals for the use and occupation 
of said 1/2 portion, amounting to P1<span class="GramE">,740.00</span> then; and 
the defendants therein claimed ownership of the buildings which were the only 
improvements thereon. The decision of the Supreme Court had long become final 
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. It is hardly necessary to state herein 
that the trial court cannot change, amplify, enlarge, alter or modify the 
decision of an appellate court which is final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. The insertion in the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to be executed providing for a consideration; 
as desired by the <span class="SpellE">Guinoos</span> and the inclusion of the 
improvements, as desired by the Petitions, would be to alter, modify and change 
the final decision of this Court, which the trial court has no power to do. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view hereof, the petition is 
denied, with costs against the Petitioners." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case now before Us is an 
appeal taken by plaintiffs-appellants from the decision rendered in Civil Case 
No. 2061 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> 
referred to action for partition and recovery of; rentals and <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads as follows:

<span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>, that the issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> in Civil Case No. 2061 (now before Us on appeal) 
relative to the improvements existing on </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lot</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 127-A, as well as the 
consideration for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> and the claim for 
rentals and damages were the same issues involved in the mandamus case. We held, 
further, that our decision in the first <span class="SpellE">case—G.R</span>. No. 
L-5541 —in plain and simple language sentenced <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> 
de <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> "to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> 
one-half of Lot No. 127-A to <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span>, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Macansantos</span>, 
without pronouncement as to improvements thereon, and as to whether or not the 
herein petitioner should restore to respondents <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Guinoo</span> the 
consideration paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>." We said, further, that 
in the lower court the pleadings filed by the now appellants did not pray for 
the adjudication of any portion of the improvements in their favor but merely 
claimed one-half of Lot No. 127-A and reasonable compensation for the use and 
occupation of said one-half portion, while the defendants there now <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in this case<span class="GramE">,-</span> claimed 
ownership of the buildings and other improvement existing on said lot. For these 
reasons, in deciding the mandamus case we held that our decision in the previous 
case (appeal by certiorari), had long become <span class="SpellE">executory</span> 
and that the trial court had no authority to change amplify, enlarge, alter or 
modify said decision; that the insertion in the deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of any statement providing for a consideration 
and the inclusion of the improvements would amount to an alteration and 
modification of said final decision. All these show conclusively that the issues 
<span class="GramE">raised</span> by appellants in the present case concerning 
their alleged right to one-half of the improvements existing on the parcel of 
land known as 127-A, plus damages and rentals are already <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> as held 
by the lower court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed, with costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
