				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Commissioners of Immigration appealed from the judgment of
the Court of First Instance of Manila, holding that their decision excluding Go
Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> for having
abandoned her permanent residence was void because it was allegedly promulgated
after the expiration of the statutory one-year period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court sustained the decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry that Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span>
could be admitted as a returning resident in spite of her twenty-year
absence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General in his
notice of appeal indicated that the lower court's decision is contrary to law
(Civil Case No. 54882).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Facts</u>.- On November 8, 1961 Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span>
<span class="SpellE">Wai</span> (who was born in 1903 and is now seventy-two
years old) arrived in Manila on board a plane of the Cathay Pacific
Airways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is a widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was provided with a passport issued by
the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China
stationed at <st1:state><st1:place>Macao</st1:place></st1:state> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stamped</span> on that passport was her immigration <span class="SpellE">nonquota</span>
visa issued by the Philippine consulate at <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">J-1).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1962">March 22, 1962</st1:date>
a Board of Special Inquiry, composed of Jose Y. Lim, <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span>
J. Soto and Gregorio de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, investigated the
application of Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span>
for admission as a returning resident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Board found that the applicant arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for the first time in 1930 with her late husband, Jose Go, a permanent resident
who operated a store at <st1:address><st1:street>Villalobos Street</st1:street>,
 <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1941 the spouses left for <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose Go died in 1948 in <st1:place><st1:city>Amoy</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the war and the occupation of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by the communists, the applicant was not able to return to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chua <span class="SpellE">Guat</span>, a
Chinese resident who allegedly managed <span class="SpellE">Go's</span> store in
his absence, and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clarin</span>,
a Filipino who allegedly prepared the travel papers of the Go spouses in
October, 1941, corroborated the claim of Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> that she was a returning resident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Board of Special Inquiry concluded that Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> had satisfactorily proven
her right to admission as a returning resident notwithstanding her twenty-year
absence from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the fact that she had no reentry permit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Board of Special Inquiry was promulgated on <st1:date month="3" day="27" year="1962">March 27, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was reviewed <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>

P. Vivo, Acting Commissioner of Immigration, and by <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
N. Gaston and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span>,
Acting Associate Commissioners, all three sitting as a Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due deliberation, they voted to exclude Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

is manifest that subject is not entitled to admission as a returning resident
after having been absent from this country for a period of twenty (20)
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her taking up residence abroad
cannot be considered as a temporary visit, which is a visit made by a departing
alien with the intention of returning within the period prescribed by the rules
and regulations of this Bureau.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The allegations that Amoy was overrun by the communists in
1949, her failure to secure evidence for her application for a returning
resident visa on account of abnormal conditions and her having lost contact
with Chua <span class="SpellE">Guat</span>, are not satisfactory and cogent
reasons to warrant an exception or departure from the policy of this Bureau
requiring those applying for reentry to return within the five-year period from
their departure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The facts show that applicant had abandoned her permanent
residence in this country, considering the length of time since her husband
died in <st1:place>Amoy</st1:place> in 1948, that their business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="BODY"><u>Issue</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> The legal question in
this appeal is whether, for purposes of section 27(b) of the Immigration Law, a
resolution of the Commissioners which reversed the decision of the Board of
Special Inquiry and which was <u>adopted</u> within one year from the
promulgation of the said decision is sufficient or whether it is necessary that
the Commissioners' written decision in amplification of the resolution of
reversal or containing their findings, be promulgated within the said one-year
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That question is not new.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Ruling</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> This Court had already
held that "the operative date of the Commissioners’ action is that when
the resolution of exclusion was voted and <u>adopted</u> by them as a Board,
regardless of the date when the decision <u>in <span class="SpellE">extenso</span></u>
was prepared, written and signed" because "the decision <u>in <span class="SpellE">extenso</span></u> must relate back to the day when the resolution
to exclude was <u>adopted</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, the extended opinion had to be posterior to the day when
the Commissioners voted and resolved to reverse the findings of the Board of
Special Inquiry" (<span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. Vivo, L-24844, and
Vivo vs. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, L-24853, both decided on October 26,
1967, and reported in 21 SCRA 532, 538, per Justice J. B. L. Reyes; <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> vs. Commissioner of Immigration, L-24800, May 27,

SCRA 228, 238).</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the Commissioners were justified in using <st1:date month="3" day="11" year="1963">March 11, 1963</st1:date> as the date of their
written decision although it was actually prepared or drafted on <st1:date month="8" day="13" year="1963">August 13, 1963</st1:date> and was mailed to Go
Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span> on <st1:date month="8" day="27" year="1963">August 27, 1963</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">H-3).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The decision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A or H) related
back to the date when the Commissioners deliberated on the decision of the
Board of Special Inquiry and voted or resolved to reverse it or to exclude Go Yu
<span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 27(b) specifies that as a rule the decision of the Board
of Special Inquiry "shall be promulgated and the findings and
recommendations, in proper cases, submitted not later than two days from the
date of the deliberation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
absence of such a requirement with respect to the decision of the Board of
Commissioners supports the view that such decision need not be promulgated
within the one-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices
that the Commissioners should review the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry
and deliberate upon it within one year from the promulgation of the Board of
Special Inquiry's decision and that the minutes of their deliberation should
reflect the action which they took within the said statutory period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as noted by the Solicitor General, section 27(c)
expressly requires that the decision of the Commissioners in case of <u>an
appeal</u> from the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry, excluding an
alien, should "be put in writing and promulgated not less than seven days
from the time the case is submitted for decision".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, no such requirement is provided
for in section 27(b) with respect to the Commissioners' decision in case they <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> review
the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court erred in holding that under section 27(b) a
written decision should be signed and promulgated by the Commissioners within
one year from the promulgation of the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the <i><u>certiorari</u></i> and prohibition case
instituted by Go Yu <span class="SpellE">Tak</span> <span class="SpellE">Wai</span>
in the lower court on <st1:date month="9" day="3" year="1963">September 3, 1963</st1:date>
was the alleged lack of power on the part of the Commissioners to review the
decision of the Board of Special Inquiry after the supposed expiration of the
one-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The merits of the Commissioners'
decision of exclusion are not in issue.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as we have found that the review was <span class="GramE">effected</span>
within the one-year period, it follows that the trial court's decision should
be reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, only six (6)
Justices (Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">SEPARATE DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent on the ground that it is patent from section 27 (b) of
the Immigration Act as cited on pages 4-5 of the decision penned by Mr. Justice
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> that "the decision of any two members of
the Board [of Special Inquiry] shall prevail and shall be final unless reversed
on appeal by the Board of Commissioners as hereafter stated, or, in the absence
of an appeal, unless reversed by the Board of Commissioners after a review by
it, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
of the entire proceedings within one year from the promulgation of said
decision."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such review and reversal of the decision of the board of special
inquiry may be in two ways:</p>

<p class="BODY">The first is a reversal <u>on appeal</u> by the Board of
Commissioners "as hereafter stated" - which refers to the provisions
of section 27 (c) of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
section 27 (c) provides that an alien excluded by a board of special inquiry or
a dissenting member thereof [from a majority decision which either includes or
excludes the alien]<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
may appeal to the Board of Commissioners whose decision in the case shall be
final and that "the decision on appeal shall be put <u>in writing</u> and <u>promulgated</u>
not less<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
than <u>seven days</u> from the time the case is submitted for decision";
and</p>

<p class="BODY">The second is by review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of the Board of Commissioners [of a decision
either for inclusion or exclusion] "<u>within one year</u> from the
promulgation of said decision." Such a decision of reversal must be put <u>in
writing</u> and <u>promulgated</u> within the statutory one-year period and it
is not sufficient or valid, as the decision would hold, that the Commissioners <u>voted</u>
to reverse the special inquiry board's decision of admission of March 27, 1962
as per their minutes of March 11, 1963 although the decision of reversal dated
March 11, 1963 was <u>admittedly drafted</u> only on August 13, 1963 and signed
sometime between then and August 26, 1963 by the commissioners and <u>actually
promulgated</u> and mailed on August 27, 1963, long <u>after</u> the expiration
on March 27, 1963 of the statutory one-year period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Act's provisions as well as public policy support such a
construction that requires that a resolution or decision of the Board of
Commissioners on a review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of the special inquiry board's decision
(whether of admission or exclusion) must be put <u>in writing</u> and <u>promulgated</u>
with due notice on the party affected <u>within</u> the statutory <u>one-year</u>
period of finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the provisions of law involved, section 27 (b) of the Act
provides <span class="SpellE">mandatorily</span> that "the decision [of the
board of special inquiry] shall be promulgated and the findings and
recommendation, in proper cases, submitted not later than <u>two days</u> from
the date of deliberation." Section 27 (c) likewise provides for a summary
period of <u>seven days</u> from submittal for decision within which the Board
of Commissioners shall put in writing and promulgate its decision on an <u>appeal</u>
of the alien or of a dissenting member of the board of special inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Read in context, it seems obvious that the
decision on a review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
by the Board of Commissioners must be no less than a decision on appeal by
either party, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>, it must be duly put <u>in
writing</u> and <u>promulgated</u> within the more than adequate one-year
period fixed by the Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public policy and due process buttress such a construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the alien has appealed from an adverse
decision or a dissenting special inquiry board member has appealed a favorable
decision, the applicant for admission knows as mandated by the law that a final
decision must be handed down within seven days from submittal of the appeal for
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there has been no appeal
and the Board of Commissioners conducts a review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> of which the applicant is likely unaware,
both public policy and due process demand that where no adverse decision is
promulgated within the statutory one-year period of finality, the decision of
the special inquiry board shall have become final and beyond the Commissioners'
authority to reverse or set aside thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Otherwise, such one-year period would be an elastic rather than a fixed
period and would have no meaning, as in this case where the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
would have been ordered excluded by a decision of reversal promulgated <u>five
months after</u> the lapse of the one-year period.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a view is certainly in consonance with the law's policy of a
definite date of fixed <u>finality</u> of the special inquiry board's decision
- be it of inclusion or exclusion of an alien - and to reduce to the minimum
any opportunity or occasion for anomalies and irregularities in the admission
or exclusion of aliens and applicants for admission under the procedures for
appeal or review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
established by the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Neria</u></span><u> vs. Commissioner of Immigration</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court through the now Chief Justice precisely noted a deliberate <u>ante-dating</u>
by <u>six days</u> of the Board of Commissioners' action of reversal <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> of the
special inquiry board's admission and declared the decision of reversal <u>null
and void</u>, ruling that "the said decision of the Board of Immigration
Commissioners, and the warrant of exclusion issued on the strength of such decision,
are therefore, as correctly found by the lower court, null and void, for '<u>lack
of jurisdiction</u>', since the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry No. 1
by that time had already become '<u>final</u>.'"</p>
