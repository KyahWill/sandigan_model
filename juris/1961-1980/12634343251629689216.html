				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision of the Circuit Criminal Court, Seventh Judicial
District, in Criminal Case No. CCC-VII-953-Rizal, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the accused <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>, GUILTY, beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of Murder as defined under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as charged in
the Information, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH;
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Patrolman Jaime <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>,
the amount of P12,000.00; to pay the amount of P10,000.00 as moral damages and
another P10,000.00 as exemplary damages; and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Information in the foregoing criminal case accuses appellant <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> and four (4)
other unknown persons of having committed the crime of Murder in the following
manner:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 1st day of May, 1971, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one
another, with intent to kill, at nighttime, a circumstance deliberately sought
by the accused to facilitate the commission of the offense, with treachery,
taking advantage of superior strength, with insult to the public authorities
and by the use of motor vehicle, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously attack, assault and shoot with guns Patrolman Jaime <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>, hitting and inflicting upon the vital parts of his
body mortal gunshot wounds which caused his untimely death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove the guilt of the accused, the prosecu­tion presented the
testimonies of four (4) witnesses, namely, <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span>
Pasco, the alleged eyewitness, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Cueva</span>, Jr.,
NBI Medico-Legal Officer, <span class="SpellE">Rodino</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state>,
a taxi driver and Juanita <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>,
widow of the deceased Pat. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco, the lone eyewitness,
testified that on <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1971</st1:date>
while she was working at the Topside Cafe at <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
corner Superhighway, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, she saw <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening, with around ten (10) companions who arrived therein in a
taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time, <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> was dressed in
short pants and polo shirt, and two of his companions were wearing fatigue uniforms
and the rest were in civilian clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> was then carrying
a small or short firearm while his companions had <span class="SpellE">armalites</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she asked one of the companions of the
accused where they came from, he replied that they came from the highway where
they slaughtered a dog for "<span class="SpellE"><i>pulutan</i></span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> and his
companions later left the Topside Cafe but returned at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="23">11:30 P.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they returned they were already drunk and they danced with the
girls in the Topside Cafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this was
going on, Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Liberato</span> Fernandez and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span> arrived in a jeep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span> accosted the persons in civilian
clothes who were carrying <span class="SpellE">armalites</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the companions of <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>
who had been talking with her went out and handed a piece of paper to Pat.
Fernandez Shortly thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>, armed as
aforesaid with a small gun, and his companions surrounded the two
policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard a gun re­port and
she lay flat on the floor face downwards because she was afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she heard suc­cessive shots and
somebody shouted: "<span class="SpellE"><i>Patay</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i>na</i></span> <i>'<span class="SpellE">yan</span></i>!" She
admits that she did not see who uttered those words as she was lying face down
on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard someone say:
"<i>May <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">tao</span> pa <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">diyan</span></i>?".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> and his companions left the scene of the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she stood up, she saw
that she was alone in the Cafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
noticed Pat. <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span> lying on the ground already
dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to this witness, Pat.
Fernandez was hit by a stray bullet.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, this witness admitted that she did not
immediately go to the police sta­tion to report the incident but that certain
police­men arrived at the scene and asked her what her name was; that Mrs. Rose
Ortiz, the owner of the Topside Cafe, did not allow her to give a statement
because according to the latter she would be the one to give a statement; that
however, witness and Mrs. Ortiz were invited to go to the police station where
they stayed until the following morning; that she did not then give a
statement, allegedly because Mrs. Ortiz still would not allow her to do so; and
that she gave a statement to the police only on September 25, 1971 when she was
accompanied by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mariano B. <span class="SpellE">Cueva</span>, Jr., Medico-Legal
Officio of the NBI, testified for the prosecution, thus that he performed the <i>post
mortem</i> examination on the body of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>
and prepared the Necropsy Report (Exhibit "A"); that after the
positive identification was made by the widow of the victim, photographs were
taken by the NBI photographer (Exhibits "B", "B-1" to
"B-3"); that from the size of the gunshot' wounds, the bullets
causing them could have been fired from Caliber .22 firearms, such as <span class="SpellE">armalites</span>; that they could have been caused by more than
one person; and that the victim died of severe hemorrhage as a consequence of
gunshot wounds on the chest, abdomen and left thigh.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rodino</span> Hidalgo, taxi driver, testified
that between 12:00 midnight of April 30, 1971 and 1:00 o'clock A. M. of May 1,
1971, he was driving his taxicab with Plate No. 65-79 Q.C.; that at the cor­ner
of <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> and Superhighway, he picked up five (5)
passengers; that before said passengers got in his cab, one of them boarded the
same and pointed a gun at him; that thereafter the companions of the gun
wielder, not less than four, arrived and got in the cab; that he was told by
his passengers to drive fast toward <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>; that
one of the passengers, who was in short pants, said: "<i>Kay <span class="SpellE">Ablan</span> <span class="SpellE">tayo</span>, pare</i>"; that
he was made to stop in front of a gate; that the person in short pants again
spoke and said: "<span class="SpellE"><i>Tiyak</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>
<span class="SpellE">iyon</span>, pare</i>", and the group alighted from the
cab after paying the fare of P0.80; that thereafter he brought the cab to the
garage and went to see his brother, Reynaldo Hidalgo, and he heard that a
policeman had killed; that they proceeded to a police precinct in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> where he gave his statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In open court, witness identified the accused
as the person in short pants who boarded his taxicab.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, this witness stated that he could not
remember the place where he took the accused and his companions; that he did
not notice any confusion at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> and
Superhighway and that he did not hear any shots; that from the time his
passengers boarded the cab until they reached their destination, the light in
his cab was off; and that he did not know to whom his passengers were referring
when one of them said "<span class="SpellE"><i>Tiyak</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>
<span class="SpellE">iyon</span>, pare</i>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Juanita <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>,
widow of the victim, testified, among others, that she made the identi­fication
of her husband's body at the <span class="SpellE">Funeraria</span> <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense, on the other hand, presented the testimonies of
Abraham Domingo, a Philippine Constabulary Officer with the rank of Captain,
COSAC <span class="SpellE">Battallion</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> and of the appellant, <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Abraham Domingo testified that from February 1, 1971 up to July
15, 1971, he was the Commanding Officer of the COSAC; that he knows the
appellant who was one of the members of the First COSAC Company; that due to
the fact that at that time, the COSAC was newly organized, they were short of
fire­arms and he gave verbal orders to his supply offi­cer not to issue
firearms except for actual missions; that before a member could be issued a
firearm, he had to have a mission order; that on March 5, 1971, <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> asked him for
permission to see one of his informers that night, and permission was granted
but no mission order was given; and that no firearm was issued to the appellant
because meeting an informer does not require the issuance of fire­arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, this witness stated
that <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> told him that he was meeting an informer
to secure more information on the purported smug­gling of blue seal cigarettes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>
testified in his be­half, stating that as member of the Intelligence Division
of the Philippine Constabulary First COSAC Company, he is charged with the duty
of apprehending smugglers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1971</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 A.M.</st1:time>, he met a certain informant by the
name of "Boy" at Port Area, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
who tipped him of the forthcoming landing of smuggled goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the information was incomplete, they agreed
to meet again at the corner of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> and South Superhighway on the night of the
same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reported the matter to
Capt. Domingo who gave him verbal authority to proceed with his plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arrived unarmed at the meeting place at <st1:time minute="15" hour="23">11:15 P.M.</st1:time>, instead of the agreed time which
was <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> P. M. because he happened
to fall asleep in his room at the camp.</p>

<p class="BODY">He failed, however, to meet his informer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the Topside Kitchenette, he
peeped inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the door two armed men
in fatigue uniform carrying <span class="SpellE">armalites</span> collared him
but when he identified himself as a PC sergeant, he was allowed to leave, after
they identified themselves, saying that they were members of a task force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then returned to his camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time, he was unarmed and was wearing a
checkered polo jack and a pair of green long pants.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further denied that he entered the Topside Kitchenette at
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="20">8:30 P.M.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reiterated his claim that he neither shot
nor participated in the shooting of the victim, Pat. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge, however, gave more weight and credence to the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco rather than to those of
the defense, and found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
murder and imposed upon him the penalty of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge said:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * It was not established who fired the first shot but it
is incontrovertible that accused <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> fired his gun at the deceased, this much was
testified to by eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco, who at the
time was only two-arms length away from the door of the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>, although
wounded, was able to draw his gun before falling to the ground mortally
wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. Fernandez, seeing the
unevenness of the fight, al­though already wounded, was able to run away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the accused was heard to say, '<span class="SpellE">Patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>,'
referring to Pat. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> said 'May <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">tao</span> pa <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">diyan</span>?',
apparently ref­erring to Fernandez and other possible eyewitnesses to the
cold-blooded killing of <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the group believed that there were no eyewitnesses to
the killing, they then made good their escape.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Conviction or acquittal of the accused hinges on whose
witnesses are more credible and trustworthy, that of the prosecution or the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution's quest for
conviction depends on the reliability of <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span>
Pasco, who has positively identified the accused as having shot the victim in
this case, plus the corrobora­tive testimony of taxi driver <span class="SpellE">Rodino</span>
<st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against this prosecution evidence is the
defense of denial and alibi interposed by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span>
Pasco identified the accused as one among several persons who shot the victim
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of this witness
appears to be voluntary and straightforward in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So also, from the records no evil motive was
presented by <span class="SpellE">the.defense</span> to show cause why <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city>
should falsely testify against <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adding strength to the cause of the
prosecution is the corroborative testimony of <span class="SpellE">Rodino</span>
Hidalgo that the accused in this case was among his passengers during that
fateful evening of May 1, 1971 that flagged his cab at <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>-Superhighway,
<span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and that he
overheard the accused <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> whom he identified in
court as having said, '<span class="SpellE">Tiyak</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>
<span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>, pare.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the defense of denial and alibi made by said accused, the
same cannot be, given much weight because it has not been established by
sufficient and convincing evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is undisputed that alibi or denial is the weakest of all defenses and that the
same should not be given consideration if the identity of the accused has been
established by a credible witness (PP vs. <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span>, et
al., L-19490, Aug. 26, 1968, pp. 144-175).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So also, for this kind of defense to prosper, it is necessary that the
one invoking it must show by clear and convincing evidence the physical
impossibility on his part to commit the crime imputed against him (PP vs. <span class="SpellE">Condemena</span>, L-22426, May 29, 1968, pp. 388400).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, the accused claimed
that at the time of the commission of the crime he met his informer at the
corner of <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> and South Superhighway, this being
the case, he has all the chances and time therefore to perpetrate the crime
imputed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This story of his
is a telltale version, a concocted scenario as a last ditch effort to evade
criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court is amused
also to note that this alleged informer of his was not presented in court, if
only to corroborate his story.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Treachery qualifies the crime to murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution also has successfully proven
the generic circumstances of taking advantage of superior strength, with insult
to the public authorities and use of motor vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no mitigating circumstance to
offset the aforesaid generic circumstances, the Court has no alternative except
to impose the supreme penalty provided for by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Everything considered, the Court gives more credence to the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses, which are more believable, logical and
more in the realm of possibility, rather than the testimony of the witnesses
for the defense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to this Court, appellant assails the credibility of the
lone eyewitness, <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco, on the ground that
under the circumstances narrated by her, she could not have seen that it was
the appellant who fired the shots at the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise avers that the trial court
committed an error in not having acquitted him on the ground of reasonable
doubt, and in not having given credence to his defenses of alibi and denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting Solicitor General Hector C. <span class="SpellE">Fule</span>
filed the brief for the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
recommending that the accused be acquitted on the ground that his guilt has not
been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Brief for the <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> states, in part:</p>

<blockquote>"Analyzing the above evidence, it is obvious that no witness
other than <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco implica­ted appellant in the
crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we find the
testimony of this prosecution witness contradicted by her own sworn statement
given to the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Police on <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1971</st1:date> and presented in this case as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<blockquote>"If <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco had in fact seen
appellant fire at <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>, as she insisted during the
trial, there was no reason for her to answer in her statement just quoted that
she did not see <span class="SpellE">Butawan's</span> gunman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score alone, <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city>'s
pretense of having identified appellant as the assailant must necessarily
fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her explanation, when asked why
she did not tell the police during the investigation that she saw <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> shoot <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>, that
'Because I forgot to tell that I saw him as the first one who shot <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>' (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Dec. 20,

non-reliable, untrustworthy witness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Moreover, <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city>'s
narration in her said statement of the circumstances surrounding the shooting
indubitably shows that she did not actually see appellant fire at the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said statement,
all she saw of appellant was that he went out of the Cafe with hand placed on
his right waist and after he had gone out, she heard a shot and then a series
of shots, whereupon she dropped to the floor inside the counter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said narration reads as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It thus becomes clear that <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city>'s
identification of appellant at the trial as the one who fired a shot at the
deceased patrolman is but a product of her imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action of appel­lant in going out of the
Cafe with hand placed on his right waist, which Pasco claims in her above
statement to have observed does not justify the inference that he was the one
who fired the shot at the deceased, especially if we consider the fact that, as
testified to by her, appellant's companions who were already outside the Cafe
carried <span class="SpellE">armalites</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Other circumstances which nurture serious doubt on the
opportunity of prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco to
positively identify the culprit in this case are the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pasco herself admitted that the shooting
occurred outside the Topside Cafe while she was inside said establishment (pp.
17, 18, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Dec. 20, 1971), and the record does
not show how she was able to see what was happening outside from inside the
Cafe where she was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that
she could see through the walling of the Cafe because of an open door or glass
door or wall (which was not established), it was not shown that the place
outside the Cafe was well lighted enough so as to enable her to fix the
identities of the persons therein situated, it being already midnight at the
time of the shooting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It taxes credulity that Pasco was able to
determine that it was appellant who fired the first shot at <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>
when according to her, appellant's companions, who had <span class="SpellE">armalite</span>
rifles in hand and who were then being accosted by the de­ceased policeman and
his companion, also surrounded the two police officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyone of appellant's companions armed with <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifles could very well have fired at the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is apparent from the
testimony of medico-legal officer Mariano <span class="SpellE">Cueva</span> to
the effect that the two small bullets recovered in the body of the victim were
of .22 caliber and possibly fired from an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span>
firearm (pp. 23, 31, <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="12">Dec. 20, 1971</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is surprising that although <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco, together with the Cafe owner Rosie Ortiz,
was brought to the Police headquarters shortly after the shooting, where she
was practically detained until the following morning and consequently
interrogated, no statement was taken from her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This circumstance lends support to our belief that <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city>,
from the very outset and even up to the time she executed Exhibit '1' four
months later, could not really identify the assailant of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>, for which reason the police must have seen no
useful purpose in taking down her statement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to why she gave a statement to the police on <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1971</st1:date>, or more than four months
later, wherein she still stuck to her original non-identification of the
murderer of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city>
explained that she did so 'when Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Butawan</span> took
me.' (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Dec. 20, 1971).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be inferred from said answer,
therefore, that <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city> executed her
statement (Exhibit '1') just to accede to the request of the widow of the
deceased, although she knew nothing about the identity of said deceased's
killer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Believing that "the evidence of the prosecution has failed
to implant in the mind moral certainty that its witness <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span>
Pasco had sufficient opportunity to see and recognize the assailant of
Pat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Butawan</span>
and to positively identify him", the Acting Solicitor General recommended
the acquittal of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the evidence does not show to a degree beyond
reasonable doubt the guilt of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be recalled that the shooting in this case took place <i>not

It is also important to note that <i>when the shooting took place</i>, <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco, the only alleged eyewitness, by her own
admission, was <i>inside the said Café</i> pertinent portions of her court

<p class="BODY">It is true that on cross-examination she testified that she saw appellant
shoot the victim before she went down on the floor, but this statement appears
to be only an afterthought.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her sworn declaration given before the Fiscal on <st1:date year="1971" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1971</st1:date>, some three months
before she testified in this case, <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco
declared positively that she did not see the person who shot at the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, she stated <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span> and in no uncertain terms, <i>viz</i>.:
"<i>Hindi <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">nakita</span> <span class="SpellE">nang</span> <span class="SpellE">barilin</span> <span class="SpellE">sina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Butawan</span> at Fernandez</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, how could <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco have seen the appellant
shoot the deceased on the night in question when, according to her own
admissions, she was inside the Topside Cafe, and on hearing the first shot
fired, she dropped down on the floor, lay face down, was lying down during the
successive shots which followed as she was afraid, and <i>stood up only after</i>
the armed group had fled from the scene of the crime for which reason she did
not see them run away nor the vehicle they took in their flight? It is important
to note that this sworn statement of <st1:date year="1971" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1971</st1:date> was the first declaration regarding the incident of <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1971</st1:date>. <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span>
Pasco, together with Rose Ortiz, owner of Topside Cafe, was taken to the
municipal building of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stayed there
until the following morning, but <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco did
not give any statement allegedly because Ortiz did not allow her to do so,
saying that she would be the one to give the state­ment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant that in the instant case, there is no evidence
tending to show conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of conspiracy, it is necessary to prove who shot and killed the victim,
as mere presence of the accused at the scene of the crime, in the company of
others, among whom could have been the culprits, does not establish criminal
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that where
conspiracy is absent, each of the accused is responsible only for the conse­quences
of his own act.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, the nature and extent of appellants participation, if any,
in the acts leading to the commission of the felony has not been established by
the evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, even the testimony of the taxi driver
to the effect that appellant was among those who boarded his cab under highly
suspicious circumstances does not shed light on the question of whether or not
appellant was one of those who shot and killed the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot even be definitely concluded from this witness'
testimony in open court and his state­ment before the police that it was
appellant who pointed a gun at him while riding his cab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when he was asked how many minutes
appellant pointed the gun at him, he answered, "I just felt that the gun
was poked."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In his statement (Exhibit "D"), he said that he just felt something
poked at his nape and he heard his passengers on the back seat cocking their
guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in this same statement,
he claimed to have seen three long fire­arms carried by three of the men, but
no mention at all was made of a short firearm which, according to witness <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> Pasco, was the type of weapon wielded by herein
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proof beyond reasonable doubt requires moral certainty - a
certainty that satisfies the reason and conscience of those who are to act upon
it.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Reasonable doubt, on the other hand, is that "doubt engendered by an
investigation of the whole proof and an inability after such investigation to
let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the evidence on record in this case fails to
convince this Court that the guilt of appellant <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this, the accused must be
acquitted of the crime charged.</p>
