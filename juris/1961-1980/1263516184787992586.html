Chan De to take his oath as a naturalized citizen of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chan De, a Chinese, filed his petition to be admitted as a
citizen of this country on 11 February 1960.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The government did not oppose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After trial, the Court of First Instance of <span class="GramE">Manila, in
its Civil Case No. 42539, granted, on 15 October 1960, Chan De's petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two years thereafter, and, after the petitioner filed his
petition to take his oath of allegiance, the government interposed an
opposition assailing his reproachable conduct and moral character.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court overruled the government's opposition and allowed
the petitioner to take the oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
government appealed the order allowing the oath-taking.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chan De was born on <st1:date year="1918" day="27" month="4">27
 April 1918</st1:date> in <st1:place><st1:city>Amoy</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place>
(Exhibits "C" to "C-3", "H" to "H-4",
being his residence certificates class A from 1957 to 1965).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

He married <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siok</span> Ha,

 <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place> (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., hearing on 5 April 1965, pp. 20-21).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They begot one child, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
Chan, who was born in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1941" day="22" month="10">22 October 1941</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<span class="SpellE">Siok</span> Ha died in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
after a 5-year residence in said city, on <st1:date year="1945" day="30" month="11">30 November 1945</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"Y).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Chan De took a
second wife, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> King,
allegedly on 30 April 1946 in <span class="SpellE">Chingkang</span>, China (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>. , hearing on 5 April 1965, pp. 18 and 24).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> King arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

''X"; <span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="4">5 April 1965</st1:date>, p. 20).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With his second wife, petitioner begot four children, namely, Trinidad
Chan (Chua Kim <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>), Rosita Chan (Chua Hue Han),
Benito Chan (Chua Chi Wan), and Jacinto Chan (Chua Chi <span class="SpellE">Bieng</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family resides at <st1:address><st1:street>1346
  <span class="SpellE">Soler</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>,
where the petitioner, with a partner, conducts a mercantile business, under the
name "Chan De Trading", and upon which he derives an average annual
income of about P38<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The established doctrine in naturalization cases is that the
whole record is open to review before the applicant is allowed to take his oath
of citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, we
find that the following anomalies vitiate the grant of citizenship:</p>

<blockquote>(1) The petitioner presented as his vouching witnesses <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Acuña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The former came to know the petitioner since 1944,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., hearing on 12 October 1960, p. 48); the latter,
since 1949.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore,
a gap in the evidence as to how the petitioner had conducted himself since his
arrival in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in 1934 of at least ten (10) years, as the earliest date that <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span> could testify about the petitioner was 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This void about the petitioner's behavior, is
fatal to his application for citizenship, since the law requires of an
applicant irreproachable conduct during his entire stay in this country (Chua
Pun vs. Republic, L-16825, 22 Dec. 1961; Wang I Fu vs. Republic, L-15819, 29
Sept. 1962; O Ku <span class="SpellE">Phuan</span> vs. Re­public, L-23406, 31
Aug. 1967; <span class="SpellE">Jao</span> King <span class="SpellE">Yog</span> vs.
Republic, L-24950, 10 Feb. 1968.) </blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) In his deceased wife's certificate of death, Exhibit
"Y" Chan De, as the informant, signed as "Chan De".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the information calling for the name of
the surviving spouse of the deceased (No. 10 in the certificate), Chan De
filled it out with "Mr. Chua <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> Lai".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, on the witness stand, he was asked who
Chua <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> Lai was, he replied that he, Chan De, was the
same person referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asked to
explain the use of the other name, Chan De gave out the excuse that the name
"Chua <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> Lai" was his school name and is
the name by which his wife and old friends in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
called him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insisted that he had not
used such name in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but when his attention was called to his use of the name "Chua <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> Lai" in the death certificate and his reason for
using it, he answered unresponsively with: "In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
there is no Chua <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> Lai there is Chan De only."
Asked again if that was his only reason, his answer was: "It is the same
person." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., hearing on 5
April 1965, pp. 30-31).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief,
he tried to misrepresent or hide a certain fact and tried to parry, by another
act of dishonesty, the possible charge of unauthorized use of an alias.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Chan De’s actuations in reporting about the death of his first
wife to the civil registrar and his attempt to justify said actuations, or to
squirm out of it, are, in themselves, acts of <span class="SpellE">misbehaviour</span>
that disqualify the petitioner from the grant of the privilege of citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, Chan De did use another name in the death
certificate and he failed to mention this other name in his petition for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, his other
name, Chua <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> Lai, was not included in the
publications of his application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
failure is fatal to the proceedings, because persons who would have known the
petitioner by his other name, Chua <span class="SpellE">Tu</span> Lai, and
possess derogatory information about him, were pre­cluded from coming out with
such information (Yu <span class="SpellE">Seco</span> vs. Re­public, L-13441, 30
June 1960; Kwan <span class="SpellE">Kwock</span> How vs. Republic, L-18521, 30
Jan. 1964).</p>

<blockquote>(3) Petitioner had enrolled his children in different schools,
among which are: <st1:place><st1:placename>Hope</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Christian</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>High School</st1:placename></st1:place>, Philippine Chinese
Republican School and <st1:place><st1:placename>Chiang</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Kai</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Shek</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High
  School</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where the percentage of Chinese enrollees
to the total school population is 72%, 84% and 82%, respectively (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"U-1").</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enroll­ment of petitioner's children in
these schools with predominant Chinese student population negates a sincere
desire to embrace the customs, traditions and ideals of the Filipino people (Li
Tong <span class="SpellE">Pek</span> vs. Republic, L-20912, 29 Nov. 1965; Lim
Yuen vs. Republic, L-21218, 24 Dec. 1965; Chan <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> <span class="SpellE">Huat</span> vs. Republic, L-19479, 28 Feb. 1966; Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> vs. Republic, L-19899, 18 March 1967).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Li Tong <span class="SpellE">Pek</span></u> case, <u>supra</u>,
this Court, through Mr. Justice Bautista Angelo, held as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We also take note of the claim that the four children of
school age of petitioner named Peter, Josefina, Lily and Andrew were only
enrolled by him either in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Anglo-Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place> or in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Hope</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Christian</st1:placename> <st1:placename>School</st1:placename></st1:place>,
operated in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, which, though recognized by
our government, are however run by Chinese mentors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The least that can be said is that said
institutions being predominantly, if not exclusively, attended by Chinese
students are operated primarily for the education of Chinese children, since
they are being supervised by Chinese citizens.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is an indication that by enrolling his children in said schools
petitioner has not evinced a sincere desire to become a Filipino citizen as
should be expected from one who <span class="GramE">desire</span> to embrace our
citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance is in our
opinion enough to disqualify him to become a Filipino citizen."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing suffice to show Chan De's ineligibility to
Philippine citizenship; hence, it is not necessary to pass upon the
government's other assignment of errors.</p>
