				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from a resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations, sitting <em>en 
banc</em>, dated March 23, 1961.</p>
<p>Sometime in 1949, the Undersecretary of Labor certified to the Court of 
Industrial Relations—hereafter referred to as the CIR—the existence of a labor 
dispute between the International Oil Factory—hereafter referred to as the 
Factory—and its workers who were members of the National Labor Union, hereafter 
referred to as NLU. The dispute involved 18 demands of the latter regarding 
conditions of employment, including vacation arid sick leave. In a decision 
promulgated on May 11, 1951, said court held, with regard to the demand for 
vacation leave: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Demanda" 3.—<em>'15 days vacation leave with full pay.' </em><br>'"Segun log 
principios de derecho social, la concesion de la licencia de vacacion dependa de 
la situacion economica de la empresa y las exigencias del bien comun. Constando 
que la compaña margina ganancias, es ineludible la concesion de este privilegio. 
Que la recurrida, per lo tanto, conceda a sus empleados y obreros quince (15) 
dias de vacacion por cada ano de servicio continuo, fiel y satisfactorio 
mientras su estado financiero lo permita".</p></blockquote>
<p>An appeal taken from this decision by the Factory was dismissed by the 
Supreme Court for lack of merit. Meanwhile, or on October 4, 1955, the CIR had 
issued an order authorizing the execution of said decision during the pendency 
of the appeal. This order was, however, set aside by the CIR sitting en banc in 
a resolution dated December 5, 1955, which referred the case "to the trial court 
for the determination of the question" referred to in the decision of May 11, 
1951.</p>
<p>In April 1956, before the evidence on the points specified in said resolution 
could be taken, twenty-five (25) members of the NLU resigned therefrom and 
organized the International Oil Factory Workers Union, hereafter referred to as 
FFW." On May 8, 1956, the FFW declared against the Factory a strike which was, 
on January 26, 1957, declared illegal by the CIR. Several days before, or on 
January 18, 1957, said court had, in pursuance of the aforementioned resolution 
of December 5, 1955, begun to receive the evidence for the FFW on the vacation 
leave referred to in said decision of May 11, 1951. After the presentation of 
some witnesses, the FFW reached a compromise agreement with the Factory, which 
undertook to drop the case filed against the FFW members for the illegal strike 
above referred to and to grant them eight (8) days prospective vacation leave 
yearly. This agreement was approved by the CIR on April 12, 1957.</p>
<p>Soon after, or on July 9, 1957, the NLU began to introduce before the CIR its 
evidence on the subject matter of the resolution of December 5, 1955, 
implementing the decision of May 11, 1951. As the reception of the evidence 
could not be completed on that occasion, the case was set for continuation of 
the hearing on August 5, 1957. However, on July 15, 1957, the FFW filed a motion 
praying that the court declare itself without jurisdiction, to proceed with the 
taking of said evidence of the NLU, upon the theory that the compromise 
agreement above mentioned was binding upon the NLU. This motion was, on August 
26, 1957, denied by the trial Judge, who was, however, overruled by the court en 
banc, which, in a resolution dated March 2, 1958, held that the NLU was bound by 
said compromise agreement. On Appeal taken by the NLU, said resolution was set 
aside in G. R. No. L-13845 (May 30, 1960) of this Court, which ordered the case 
remanded to the CIR for further proceedings. Upon receipt of the records by the 
CIR, the question arose whether the evidence to be taken under its resolution of 
December 5, 1955, would be limited to the period from 1951 to 1955, or should 
extend to the year 1960. Passing upon this issue, the trial Judge, Hon. Jose S. 
Bautista, held, in an order dated January 28, 1961:</p>
<p>"During the hearing of this case on January 18, 1961, the counsel for the 
National Labor Union, as well as the Attorney for Primo Zamora, et al., 
requested the Court to examine the financial condition of the respondent, 
International Oil Company, through its books of amounts from 1951 to 1960, 
inclusive, pursuant to the final resolutions of this Court, dated May 11, 1951 
and December 5, 1955.</p>
<p>"Respondent, International Oil Factory, objected to said motion and alleged 
among others, that the examination should be limited only from 1951 to 1955, 
because of the collective bargaining agreement entered into by and between the 
said factory and the International Oil Workers Union (FFW). This allegation of 
respondent has already been decided by our Supreme Court in 108 Phil., 387, 
entitled National Labor Union vs. International Oil Factory, promulgated May 30, 
1960, that such agreement is not binding on the National Labor Union. </p>
<p>"IN VIEW THEREFORE, the motion of the National Labor Union and Primo Zamora 
et al., is hereby granted. The Examining Division of this Court is hereby 
ordered to examine the books of accounts of the International Oil Factory from 
1951 up to 1960, inclusive, to determine the financial conditions of the 
factory, and upon termination, the result thereof will forthwith be submitted to 
this Court." </p>
<p>On motion for reconsideration of the Factory, the CIR sitting <i>en banc</i>, 
in a resolution dated March 23, 1951, modified "the coverage period in the 
examination of the books of accounts of the International Oil Factory in the 
sense that instead of 'from 1951 up to 1960, inclusive', it should be from 1951 
up to 1955 as decreed by the decision of our Supreme Court promulgated on May 
30, 1960". Hence this appeal by certiorari of the NLU.</p>
<p>The only issue in this appeal is whether, under the resolution of the CIR of 
December 5, 1955, which is already final and executory, granting its employees 
or laborers "quince (15) dias de vacacion por cada año de servicio continuo, 
fiel y satisfactorio mientras su estado finaneiero lo permita" (italics ours), 
the NLU is entitled to examine the records of the Factory from 1951 to 1960, or 
only up to 1955, in order to determine whether the financial condition of the 
Factory permits the payment of the aforementioned vacation leave. In this 
connection said resolution, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the final judgment says:</p>
<p>'Que la recurrida, por lo tanto, concede a sus empleados y obreros quince 
(15) dias de vacacion por cada año de servicio continuo, fiel y satisfactory 
mientras sn estado financiero lo permita (Decision sobre algunas demandas, p. 
243 of the record). </p>
<p>"And, since the concession of said benefit depends upon the economic 
situation of the company, the respondent company is hereby given the opportunity 
to prove its financial condition from the year 1951 up to the present; and the 
petitloner-union, on the other hand, may show that tho laborers have rendered 
continuous, loyal and satisfactory service during the aforesaid period.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the Order of October 4, 1955, providing for the execution of the 
decision is hereby set aside; and the case is referred to the trial court for 
the determination of the questions above mentioned."</p></blockquote>
<p>Because referring to the order of the trial Judge of October 4, 1955 
(authorizing' the execution of the decision of May 11, 1951) and the resolution 
of the Court of Industrial Relations en bane of December 5, 1955, we said in the 
statement of facts in G. R. No. L-13845,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On October 4, 1955, the CIR issued an Order granting petitioner labor 
union's motion for execution of the above decision. Said order was, however, set 
aside by the CIR in its resolution, en banc, of December 5, 1955 (Annex 'B'), in 
order that the CIR may receive evidence (1) on the financial condition of the 
respondent Company from 1951 to 1955, and (2) on the continuous, loyal, and 
satisfactory service of the workers, members of petitioner labor union during 
the said period."</p></blockquote>
<p>the Court of Industrial Relations en banc, in its Resolution of March 23, 
1961, concluded that the coverage of the resolution of December 5, 1955, did not 
go beyond such year 1955, pursuant to our decision in said G. R. No. L-13845, 
and that consequently, the trial Judge had no right to authorize the examination 
of respondent's records up to 1960.</p>
<p>We find ourselves unable to sanction this view. To begin with, having become 
final and executory before the appeal in G. R. No. L-13845, the CIR, resolution 
of December 5, 1955, could not have been reviewed or modified by this Court in 
said G. R. No. L-13845. Secondly, the only question for determination therein 
was whether the compromise agreement between respondent and the FFW, approved on 
April 12, 1957, was binding upon the NLU and this was decided in the negative. 
Thirdly, the period within which the NLU would be entitled to examine the 
records of the Factory was not, and could not be put in issue or sought to be 
decided in said G. R. No. L-13845. Fourthly, the aforementioned CIR resolution 
of December 5, 1955, clearly and explicitly declared that respondent was thereby 
"given the opportunity to prove its financial condition from the year 1951 up to 
the present". Obviously the year 1955 was mentioned in our decision in G. R. No. 
L-13845, merely because said resolution was dated December 5, 1955. Lastly, 
if—as the CIR had declared in its decision of May 11, 1951, and sought to 
implement with its resolution of December 5, 1955—the right of NLU members to 
vacation leave was dependent upon the financial condition of respondent, there 
was no reason to grant said vacation leave up to 1955, only, and deny it 
thereafter, if the financial condition of the Factory still permits it.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is set aside and the order of the 
trial court dated January 28, 1961 is hereby affirmed and the records remanded 
to the trial court for further proceedings, in conformity with this decision. 
Respondent International Oil Factory shall pay the costs. It is so ordered.</p>
