				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There is a need for an inquiry into the <span class="SpellE">jural</span>
consequences attaching to the reconstitution of a title in this petition for
the review of a decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case had its origin in an action before
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, a complaint
being filed by now respondent A. L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span> Transportation
Co., Inc. for the recovery of the possession of a piece of land against the
Province of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and twenty-four private individuals occupying
portions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Earlier, it was shown
that said respondent, as plaintiff, filed a petition for the reconstitution of
its Transfer Certificate of Title covering said lot on the ground that it lost
its previous title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was successful,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> issuing an order
authorizing such reconstitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reconstitution
notwithstanding, one of the defendants, and now sole appellant, petitioner City
of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, did not surrender possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the filing of such complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent A. L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span>
Transportation Co., Inc. as plaintiff, was un­successful, its complaint for the
recovery having been dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It elevated the matter on appeal to the Court of Appeals, which
reversed the judgment of the lower court, declaring that the reconstituted
certificate of title "is valid and that [re­spondent A. L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span> Transportation Co., Inc.] is the registered owner of
Lot No. 1114 of the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Cadastre."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The City of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> in turn instituted a petition for
certiorari to review such decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the facts as found by it, which we are not
at liberty to alter, we sustain the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">What were the facts as found by the Court of Appeals?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to its decision now under
review:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We note that the - issues
raised and the evidence adduced on behalf of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
city and even the findings of the trial court relate to the acquisition or
ownership of the lot, its alleged registration <span style="">as a </span><span style="">result of a
cadastral survey and hearing, and the reconstitution of the title to the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, however, the fact of
reconstitution is not in dispute, there is no need in this action to go into
the question </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">acquisition or ownership of the property or
to deter­mine whether the reconstituted title thereof was obtained in bad faith
or in a fraudulent manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, as
far as the reconstitution is concerned, it is unsafe for this Court at this
instance to make any finding as to whether it was procured in bad faith or
fraudulently since the record of the reconstitution proceeding is not before
us; besides there is the presumption of regularity in the granting of the
reconstituted title."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To show why the appeal of
respondent A. L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span> Transpor­tation Co., Inc. from
the decision of the lower court was meritorious, the Court of Appeals referred
to the applicable statutory provision which leaves no doubt that the
reconstituted certificate of </span>title has the same validity and legal
effect as the original there­of.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The force to which such statutory language is entitled was clearly set forth in
the leading case of Philippine National Bank v. de la <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, speaking through justice J. B. L. Reyes, stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"it appears that prior to the
institution of these proceedings with the court below, there had already been a
judicial reconstitution of the original certificates of title upon petition of
the registered owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike in the
extrajudicial reconstitution of titles, wherein there is the statutory
reservation that the new title 'shall be without prejudice to any party whose
right or interest in the property was duly noted in the original, at the same
time it was lost or destroyed' <span style="">(Sec. 7, </span>Republic Act No. 26), a judicially
reconstituted title, by express provisions of the statute (Sec. 10, <u>ibid</u>),
'shall not be subject to the encumbrance referred to in section 7’ of the Act.
Evidently, the statute would not ordinarily allow the reconstitution of liens
and other encumbrances not noted in the judicially reconstituted owner's
certificate of title."</p>

<p class="BODY">Even the objection based on procedure on due process grounds
could not prosper for as clearly set forth in the above decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"While it may be true that no notice was
sent by registered mail to the petitioner bank when the judicial reconstitution
of title was sought, such failure, however, did not amount to a jurisdictional
defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings therein being <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>, the cadastral court acquired jurisdiction
to hear and decide the petition for the reconstitution of the owner's title
upon compliance with the required posting of notices and publication in the
Official Gazette."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the above conclusive
pronouncement of this Court to which, as was to be expected, the Court of
Appeals paid deference, the first three assigned errors of the City of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, the sole appellant, could thus be disposed
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals did not err in
holding that the fact of reconstitution of title to the land in question is not
in dispute, in concluding that the proceedings before the lower court was not
in the nature of a direct attack on the legality of the issuance of the
reconstituted title, and in declaring respondent A. L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span>
Transportation Co., Inc. as the owner of Lot No. 1114 on the basis of the
reconstituted title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the fourth error
deals with the alleged "overwhelming evidence" to rebut the
presumption of legality in the issuance of the re­constituted title is factual,
it cannot be inquired into in this petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Necessarily, likewise,
the fifth alleged error to the effect that petitioner should vacate the
premises within a period of one year and to pay damages would be
unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may require further
reservation though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ably written
brief of petitioner, represented by City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span>, "emphasized that the land in dispute
is now a public road (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Avenue) making up one of
the vital arteries of commerce and trade in <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the principal outlet to and
from the Pier Area where vessels both coastwise and unload their cargoes; from
the Pier Area it leads to the market and the commercial sector of the City; and
from various points it is </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">most convenient road to the Post Office, the
frontage of which abuts the land in litigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ordering the petitioner to vacate the property would in effect cut off
access to the areas of trade and commerce, thereby adversely affecting the
economic potential of petitioner and its inhabitants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally the closing of the road would
otherwise create serious inconvenience to vehicular pedestrian traffic to which
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Avenue has been devoted since 1947, or a
period of seventeen years."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Such a problem thus gives
rise to a matter of public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately, it is not a new one in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">appro­priate solution, </span><span style="">was
indicated in the leading case of Alfonso v. <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City where this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, </span><span style="">held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">"In the present, Alfonso remains up to
now the owner of the land in question, Lot No. 4368 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>, because being registered land, the City of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> or its predecessor, Municipality of Pasay, did not
and could not acquire it thru prescription.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As registered owner, he could bring an action to recover possession at
any time because possession is one of the attributes of ownership of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said restoration of possession by
the City of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> is neither convenient nor feasible
because it is now and has been used for road purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the only relief available is for the City
of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> to make due compensation, which it could and
should have done years ago since 1925."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That respondent A. L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span> Transportation Co., Inc. with an equally well-written
brief prepared by its counsel, Atty. Ramon C. Fernandez, is not insensible to
such a solution is indicated therein, where the following is set forth:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the instant case, the Court of
Appeals has given the petitioner a period of one year within which to
expropriate the portion occupied by the road if it does not want to return the
portion in question to the respondent, ALATCO."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is thus obvious why
the last assignment of error is equally not persuasive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Appeals of November 18, 1963, as modified by its resolution </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">January 22, 1964, is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
