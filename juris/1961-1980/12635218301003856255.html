				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For a life needlessly lost, that of Claudio <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>,
in a senseless encounter, appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> were
prosecuted for murder, the killing being qualified by treachery. Only
appellant, who fired the fatal shot, was convicted of such an offense; the
other accused, who did not appeal, being held liable only for the offense of
slight physical injuries inflicted on the aggrieved party, no conspiracy having
been shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant would impress on
this Court that the judgment should have been one of acquittal, as the shooting
was the result of his having acted in the fulfillment of a duty or in the
lawful exercise of his office, he being a member of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Gingoog</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
careful study of the evidence of record, however, does not justify the setting
aside of the decision reached by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conviction arose from the facts as testified to by the
prosecution given credence by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1968</st1:date>, at
around <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the evening, the
victim, Claudio <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and five others, including
the witness Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Rafal</span>, were gathered together
below the house of another eyewitness, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Caban</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanoc</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Gingoog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In no time at all, <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> and appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span>
arrived on board a truck, parking it near such house.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The two then approached the <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> group and asked
whether there were prostitutes available.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was <span class="SpellE">Caban</span> who answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There are no prostitutes here."
Appellant <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>,
however, did not believe such a statement.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant, desirous of finding out for himself, went up the house, with <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> being left behind.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
After ascertaining that such indeed was the case, appellant immediately
proceeded downstairs, and while still descending, shouted to <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pare, there [are no women]."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> was not to be mollified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He exclaimed in anger: "You all deserve
a kick."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He vented his displeasure by giving a blow to <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> A
fist fight ensued, with <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> apparently on the
losing end.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span>, without more ado and fast on the
draw, fired at <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, hitting him at the
"right side of his stomach."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
With such a turn of events, the rest of the group immediately dispersed,
scampering for safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, badly wounded, attempted to flee, but was fired
upon again by appellant, without however the bullet finding its mark.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, together with <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>, on board the same
truck, appellant hurriedly left the place.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After they had gone, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Caban</span> and
one Jorge <span class="SpellE">Daculap</span>, coming out of their hiding place,
looked for <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> whom they found still alive some
30 meters behind <span class="SpellE">Caban's</span> house crying for help:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Brod</span>, don't
leave because I will die with this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was shot by Jose <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
They were unable to do much for the victim as, trying to carry him, they found
him too heavy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife was then
fetched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the help of the neighbors,
<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> was taken to the Mission Clinic at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Gingoog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died two hours later, having in the
meantime given an ante-mortem statement pointing to appellant as the one who
shot him.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the lower court decision before us, the doctor who
conducted the autopsy found two gunshot wounds traceable to the fatal shot on
the body of the deceased, one being located at the "region of the back,
right thoracic area near the scapular region, posterior <span class="SpellE">midclavicular</span>
line" and the other at the "right lumbar region of the abdomen,"
The cause of death, according to the medical finding, was "shock secondary
to massive <span class="SpellE">intraperitoneal</span> and <span class="SpellE">intrathoracic</span>
hemorrhages secondary to perforation of right lung; liver, duodenum, mesenteric
portion of jejunum, right kidney secondary to gunshot wound."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth in the appealed decision, "the accused Jose <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> [was found] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
offense charged of murder, and there being no aggravating or mitigating
circumstances [was] sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> with all the accessory penalties provided for by
law and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Claudio <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>
in the sum of P12,000.00."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the two principal errors discussed jointly in the
well-written brief of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
Senator Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span>, would find fault with the
above decision as appellant, who was the peace officer, being in the Secret
Service Division of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Gingoog</span> City,
was allegedly entitled to the benefits of the justifying circumstance of having
acted in the fulfillment of a duty or in the lawful exercise of a right or
office, the lower court failing to accord belief and credence to the evidence
submitted by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence his acquittal is
sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted at the outset, such a
plea, while strongly pressed, is unconvincing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The conviction must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief for the
appellant would present his side of the case thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On June 9. 1968 at about 7 o'clock in
the evening while he was at the residence of the City Mayor, his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> arrived and
reported [his being mauled] at <span class="SpellE">Balanoc</span> by somebody
and because of his assignment he referred the matter to the Mayor, and when the
latter came to know about it he, Jose <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span>, was
ordered by the Mayor to go with <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> to find out who were the persons who mauled the
latter and to arrest them * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
and <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> arrived
at <span class="SpellE">Balanoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> pointed to him the place where the incident
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was dark and at a distance
he saw a light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded to the
lighted place, and when they arrived, one person approached them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went down from the three-fourth truck
and asked the person who approached them who were those persons who were noisy
and the man replied that those persons were drinking and waiting for
women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Caban</span>
told him that the men were waiting for women, he asked <span class="SpellE">Caban</span>
to go upstairs and at the same time asked <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> to identify the man who boxed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After finding out that there were no women
upstairs, <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caban</span>
decided to go upstairs and while going upstairs he, Jose <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span>,
saw <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> being
boxed by one person and was surrounded by the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing that his companion was being
boxed he said 'Don't you know that I am an authority of the law?'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * and when he was about to separate <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> and the other person who boxed him, whom he later
came to know to be the victim, Claudio <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>,
another person was holding with his two hands above his (<span class="SpellE">Sabandal's</span>)
head, and this man he came to know, later as Jorge <span class="SpellE">Daculay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, however, he was able to evade
the blow by Jorge <span class="SpellE">Daculay</span> with the stone in his
hands, and what he did in order to stop <span class="SpellE">Daculay</span> from
any further attempt to harm him, [was to draw] his pistol, and <span class="SpellE">Daculay</span> upon seeing his pistol drawn, ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He chased <span class="SpellE">Daculay</span>
but upon reaching a dark place, he became afraid so he fired a warning
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards he went back to the
place of the incident because he heard shouts for help, and there he saw <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> and Claudio <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>
still fighting, grappling and rolling on the ground while the other persons
were holding pieces of wood and bamboo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Realizing the situation, he shouted to stop them, but the three persons
instead of stopping the fight ran away, and the two (<span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>) continued fighting and grappling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried his best to separate the
protagonists, but he found it difficult so what he did was to bend and shove <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span> who was on top of this adversary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he succeeded in separating <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>, the other person was still lying face up and while
he was bending towards him, said person (<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>)
kicked him, and he was hit on his left shoulder causing him to fall down
backward * * *. When he was trying to regain his position, Claudio <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> kicked him again hitting him this time on his
right hand which was holding his pistol, and simultaneously after that, there
was an explosion which he did not notice if somebody was hit, and after that
[he saw] <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>
and the other person with whom he was grappling still lying on the
ground."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the argument thus advanced was raised and
rejected by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision on appeal explains why the version of the prosecution is entitled to
greater credence and belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The location of the two wounds which
indicates the trajectory of the bullet jibes completely with, and confirms, the
version of the eye-witnesses for the prosecution that the victim was staggering,
body leaning backwards as if to fall on his back, when the accused <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> fired the first shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second shot when the victim was on the
run apparently was a miss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story of
the accused Jose <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> is fishy from the very
beginning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And worst, when the accused <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> was asked to demonstrate his position and that of
the victim at the precise time the victim allegedly kicked him on the right
hand and caused his pistol to explode accidentally, it was found that if such
was their relative position and the position of the pistol, the trajectory of
the bullet would not have been as indicated by the wounds on the right lumbar
region of the abdomen and the right thoracic area near the scapular area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span>
demonstrated that at the precise time his pistol accidentally exploded he was
seated on his buttocks legs extended, with his left hand braced against the
ground to support him and his right hand holding the pistol parallel to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was lying face up
with the right leg extended and the right foot touching <span class="SpellE">Sabandal's</span>
right upper arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pistol was one (1)
foot and five (5) inches from the ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand it is to be noted that the difference in elevation
between the wound on the abdomen and the wound on the back is nine (9) inches
measured from the <span class="SpellE">malleolus</span> of the right leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the help of a meter stick to trace the
trajectory of the bullet from the pistol in the position demonstrated it was
found improbable, if not impossible, for the entrance wound to be on the
abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the accused <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> was confronted with the improbabilities in his
testimony, he changed the position of the pistol and explained that at the time
his pistol exploded, he was holding it limply with his right hand; and then later
on said that he could not tell exactly the position of his pistol at the time
it accidentally exploded."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is this all that the lower court said on the subject, as
shown by the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Moreover,
there is absolutely no corroboration to the alleged accidental firing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the accused <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saluper</span>, who from his testimony seems to lose
consciousness always at the critical moment, he was almost unconscious when he
heard the shot and when he recovered consciousness the victim was no longer
beside him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So desperate were the
accused in their need for witnesses to support their story that they had to
resort to the testimony of a woman of ill-repute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even this woman failed to corroborate the
alleged accidental shooting."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Further:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Besides, if the accused <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span> were as innocent as he claims, why did he fail to
report the incident immediately that same night of <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the testimony of the Deputy Chief of Police it appears that <span class="SpellE">Sabandal</span>
did not report until the following day, and only after a memo was sent to him
to surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then strangely he refused
to submit to an investigation by his fellow officers and instead insisted on
making an affidavit of his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What had
he to fear from his fellow officers?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
these lean heavily against the accused <span class="SpellE">Sabandal's</span>
pretension of innocence."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What was said in People v. <span class="SpellE">Beraces</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
finds relevance:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is significant
that in this appeal the attack on the correctness of the lower court decision
is centered on the proposition that the prosecution failed to prove beyond
reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants would have this Court disregard the findings of the trial
judge as to the weight to be given the evidence of record. That such a power
exists is not to be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
equally undeniable that unless a fact or circumstance of weight or influence
has been shown to be disregarded by the lower court there is no justification
for its judgment as to the credibility to be attached to the testimony offered
by the witness being disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So this
Court had occasion to reiterate in the relatively recent case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The findings of the lower court embodied in
a well-written decision cannot only stand the test of the most rigid scrutiny
but also has in its favor the well-settled principle that as far as credibility
is concerned the findings of the lower court which had the opportunity to see,
hear and observe the witnesses testify and to weigh their testimonies will be
accorded the highest degree of respect by this Tribunal.' Appellants were
unable to demonstrate that such a principle should not be paid deference."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>More specifically,
concerning the defense of appellant having acted in the fulfillment of a duty
as a peace officer or in the lawful exercise thereof,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
it cannot be said that the rejection thereof by the lower court amounted to an
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there is such a justifying
circumstance admits of no doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
equally undoubted that the <span class="SpellE">codal</span> requirements are
plain and explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public official
must act in the fulfillment of his duty or in the lawful exercise of the
position he holds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be evident
then that he is acting in such a capacity, otherwise such a plea is
unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are cases when the
certainty of an accused performing the act in the discharge of his official
duties is quite apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
one of them. Rather, the evidence speaks in no uncertain terms that appellant
figured in a brawl arising from an incident in no wise connected with the
performance of a function vested in him by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No other conclusion is justifiable in the light of the facts
disclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a defense was rightfully
rejected then.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court thus paid heed to what has been decided by this
Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has been from <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. <span class="SpellE">Bertucio</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1901 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in the latest case in point, <span class="SpellE">Valcorza</span>

promulgated in 1969, is illuminating. Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"While We have not lost sight of the fact that the deceased
Pimentel was charged with a relatively minor offense, namely, stealing a
chicken; and while We do not in any way wish to encourage law enforcing
officers to be trigger-happy nor to employ force and violence upon persons
under their custody, We cannot, in the consideration of this case, disregard the
following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the said deceased, in
violation of the law, had escaped from detention; when ordered to stop by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Daiton</span> - whom he must have recognized as a peace officer in
his pursuit - he ran away and then threw himself into a creek to elude his
pursuer; after sometime he suddenly emerged from bushes near which petitioner
and a fellow policeman were and assaulted the former twice with a stone and
then ran away again pursued by petitioner and his companion; that petitioner
does not appear to be a trigger-happy policeman as shown by the fact that he
had fired five cautionary shots into the air and decided to aim directly at the
escaping detainee only when he had already reasons to fear that the latter
would be able to elude him and his companions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These facts and circumstances constrain Us to hold that the act thus
performed by petitioner - and which unfortunately resulted in the death of the
escaping detainee - was committed in the performance of his official duty and
was more or less necessary to prevent the escaping prisoner from successfully
eluding the officers of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold
him guilty of homicide may have the effect of demoralizing police officers
discharging official functions identical or similar to those in the performance
of which petitioner was engaged at the time he fired at the deceased Pimentel,
with the result that thereafter We would have half-hearted and dispirited
efforts on their part to comply with such official duty. This of course, would
be to the great detriment of public interest."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>
