<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> seeks to restrain the Municipal Judge of General 
Santos, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, from trying certain criminal cases 
filed against him for violation of Commonwealth Act No. 303 pending final 
disposal of the instant petition for certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The present petition requires an 
inquiry into the antecedents of the incident that gave rise to the petition for 
certiorari instituted by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> before the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Acharon</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was charged with a violation of 
Commonwealth Act No. 303 in four separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> 
before the Municipal Court of General Santos, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, which were set for preliminary investigation on 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="28" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">April 28, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Sometime prior to said date, <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> filed a motion to 
quash on the ground of lack of jurisdiction because (1) the administrative 
remedies provided for by the rules and regulations promulgated under the Minimum 
Wage Law as a condition precedent for the filing of a criminal action <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> were not exhausted and (2) the certification 
issued by the Secretary of Labor as a prerequisite for an action to be taken 
under Commonwealth Act No. 303 has not been obtained. This motion was denied. 
And his motion for reconsideration having been disregarded <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> alleging lack of 
jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the municipal 
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petition was given due course 
and in due time respondents filed their answer justifying the action taken by 
the Municipal Court of General Santos. However, after the court a quo has set 
the case, for hearing and allowed respondents to submit a memorandum in their 
behalf, it dismissed the petition on the ground that neither the information 
filed before the court of origin nor the order denying the motion to quash were 
incorporated into the petition thus rendering it impossible for the court to 
lender a decision on the merits. The court said: "For this failure of the 
petitioner to plead the complaint and the order in question, from which the 
court should have gathered the facts which constitute alleged lack of 
jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion, the Court is not in a position to 
render a judgment in this case." From this order of dismissal <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> took the present appeal and now petitions that, 
pending the disposal of this appeal, the Municipal Court of General Santos be 
enjoined from hearing the criminal cases above adverted 
to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are of the opinion that this 
appeal has no merit for the reason that the step <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> should have taken to obviate the technical defect 
observed by the court a quo on which it predicated its order of dismissal was 
not to appeal but to file a motion for reconsideration furnishing the court with 
the two pleadings which it considered vital for an intelligent determination of 
the case. Apparently this was not done because no such step appears in the 
record. Moreover, when the motion to quash filed by <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> that neither the information filed before the court 
of origin nor the order denying the motion to quash were incorporated into the 
petition thus rendering it impossible for the court to render a decision on the 
merits, the court said: "For this failure of the petitioner to plead the 
complaint and the order in question, from which the Court could have gathered 
the facts which constitute the alleged lack of jurisdiction and grave abuse of 
discretion, the Court is not in a position to render a judgment in this case." 
From this order of dismissal <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> took the present 
appeal and now petitions that, pending the disposal of this appeal the Municipal 
Court of General Santos be enjoined from hearing the criminal cases above 
adverted to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are of the opinion that this 
appeal has no merit for the reason that the step <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> should have taken to obviate the technical defect 
observed by the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> 
on which it predicated its order of dismissal was not to appeal but to file a 
motion for reconsideration furnishing the court with the two pleadings which it 
considered vital for an intelligent determination of the case. Apparently this 
was not done because no so such step appears in the record. Moreover, when the 
motion to quash filed by <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> to nullify the 
criminal cases filed against him was denied by the Municipal Court of General 
Santos his remedy was not to file a petition for certiorari but to go to trial 
without prejudice on his part to reiterate the special defenses he had invoked 
in his motion and, if, after trial on the merits, an adverse decision is 
rendered, to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> in the manner authorized 
by law. This is the procedure that he should have followed as authorized by law 
and precedents. Instead, he took the unusual step of filing a writ of certiorari 
before the Court of First Instance which in our opinion is unwarranted it being 
contrary to the usual course of law. We find, therefore; of no useful purpose to 
continue with the present appeal making the parties spend unnecessarily for the 
printing of their briefs only to have it dismissed in the end. As a corollary, 
we likewise find unnecessary to issue the writ of preliminary injunction prayed 
for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the present appeal is 
dismissed. The petition for preliminary injunction is denied. No 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
