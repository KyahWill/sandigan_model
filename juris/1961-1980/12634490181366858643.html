				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By the present multi-purpose petition denominated "<i style="">Certiorari</i>, Prohibition, <i style="">Mandamus</i> and Quo <span class="SpellE">Warranto</span>,
with Writ of Preliminary Injunction", the petitioners-spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> and Esther A.
Rafael-<span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> seek to be declared permanent election

and <span class="SpellE">Nestorio</span> Bautista as permanent election
registrars for the City of Manila as well <span style="">as </span>the Memorandum Order of the respondent Commission of
September 6, 1966 relieving the petitioners from their assignments as election
registrars for the fourth congressional district of Manila, to lift the order
of the respondent Commission of September 9, 1966 suspending the petitioners
for their disobedience of the relief order and their refusal to turn over their
property accountability to the four respondent election registrars, to enjoin
the respondent Commission from proceeding with the administrative investigation
of the petitioners for the disobedience and refusal aforesaid, and to compel
the respondent Benito <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> to pay to the
petitioners their withheld salaries; or, in the alternative, to command the
respondent Commission to appoint the petitioners as permanent election
registrars for the City of Manila.</p>

respondent Commis­sion, acting </span><span style="">on

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Except

subsequently incorporated in and authorized by succeeding General
Appropriations Acts, respectively, as items 176 and 178 in Republic Act </span><span style="">4164 </span><span style="">for the fiscal year </span>1964-1965; <span style="">items 177 and </span>179 <span style="">in

positions for city registrars are duly allotted to the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the implementation of
the reorganization as far as election registrars were concerned, several
problems arose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a dearth of
qualified personnel immediately avail­able to fill the openings for election
registrars required for the whole country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of the nature of the duties </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the office and the
innovations in the new system of regis­tration of voters, even the then
available personnel had first to undergo training and probation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not all the local governments called upon to
provide <span class="SpellE">accomodations</span> for the re­gistrars responded
with dispatch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the new system did
not itself catch on fast enough that it became necessary to drum up interest
therein and acceptance thereof by the electorate - a campaign which, it was
thought, would be best successful if initially waged in strategic areas of
population concentration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that Republic Act 3588 then merely provided that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 2.</span> - There shall be in each
city, mu­nicipality and municipal district at least one election registrar x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> appointed by the Com­mission
on Elections x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style="">",<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">without categorically requiring that each
election registrar be appointed to a specific station, the respondent
Commission found it expedient to adopt the policy of appointing election
registrars without indicating, in their respective appoint­ments, any specific
official station and shifting them later on from one assignment to another as
the requirements of re­gistration demanded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consonant to this policy, said respond­ent Commission actually named
almost all of its 400 special and field attorneys as "Election Registrars
in the Commis­sion on Elections".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And because of the number of prospec­tive registrants in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
some fifty of them were there­after assigned therein from time to time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation be­came <span class="GramE">specially</span>
critical when, as a condition precedent to the use of the new lists of voters
in the then forthcoming national elections, a certain percentage of the
previously registered voters had to be registered under the new system before a
given deadline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that in its all-out
effort to meet the deadline the respondent Commission went so far as to appoint
election registrars-at-large.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amongst the appointments extended under the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
policy was that of the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> who, on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1964</st1:date>, was named "Election Registrar in the Com­mission on
Elections".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Filled thereby, as
indicated in the appointment, was "Item No. 149(165), Page 23, <span class="SpellE">Reorg</span>. <span class="GramE">of</span> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
pursuant to RA 3808" corresponding to one of the positions of municipal
registrars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointment was approved
by the respondent Civil Service Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, and the said petitioner duly qualified and
assumed office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, effective
June 15, 1964, he <span style="">was, </span>in a memorandum for the purpose, "assigned as
Registrar(s) for the 4th Dis­trict, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>",
together with three others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1964</st1:date>, he was invested
with additional duties as "Election Re­gistrar-at-Large" in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
per covering memorandum of even date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, on November 2, 1964, the petitioner Esther A. Rafael-<span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>, wife of the first-named petitioner, was also
appointed "Election Registrar in the Commission on Elections" to fill
the then "Item No. 178(1271), page 2455, R.A.4164 COMELEC Standardization
Resolution 9/24/64", corresponding like­wise to one of the positions of
municipal registrars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said ap­pointment
was duly approved by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> <span style="">and </span>accepted by the appointee who forthwith assumed the duties
of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per telegraphic directive
of <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1964</st1:date>, the
respondent Esther A. Rafael-<span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> was also assigned
to act as election registrar in the fourth district of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for the adjustments in the compensation
thereof effected on December 27, 1965 and the change in the numbering of the
items involved to make them correspond with the provisions of Republic Act
4642, the General Appropriations Act for 1965­-1966, i.e., for the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>, Item 179(165),
page 2576, and for the petitioner Esther A. Rafael-<span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>,
Item 179(1271), page 2576, these are the very same positions held by the petitioners
when the present controversy came to <span style="">a </span>head.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon </span>the other <span style="">hand, </span>the respondents <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Verdejo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nestorio</span> Bautista - like the petitioners - were also duly
appointed "Election Registrar in the Commission on Elections".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his appointment of <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="2">February <span style="">1, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the respondent <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
was given "Item No. <span style="">149-(129),
Page 23, </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Reorg</span></span>. <span class="GramE">of</span> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> pursuant to RA
3808".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From his initial assignment
at <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pampanga</span></span><span style="">, he was </span>recalled on <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1964</st1:date> and instructed "to
assume and perform the du­ties of your office <span style="">as </span>Election Registrar designated by the Commission for the City
of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here he remained until <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1965</st1:date> when he was detailed to the Law
Department of the respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent <span class="SpellE">Roa</span> was appointed on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February
 1, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>to
"Item No. <span style="">149(132), </span>Page <span style="">23, </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Reorg</span></span>. <span class="GramE">of</span> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> pursuant to RA <span style="">3808", </span><span style="">which </span>he
accepted and as­sumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1964</st1:date>, he was stationed in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
"as one of the Registrars on temporary assignment", a post he occu­pied
until he was transferred to the Policy Staff of the res­pondent <span style="">Commission </span>in September, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent <span class="SpellE">Ver­dejo's</span>
position, per his appointment of <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1964</st1:date>, is "Item No. 149(101), Page 23, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Reorg</span></span>. <span class="GramE">of</span> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> pursuant to RA 3808".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was assigned as such to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="6"><span style="">June </span><span style="">4, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>and actually assumed office thereat
on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="6">June 8 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the respondent Bautista was, under
an appointment <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="1"><span style="">January </span><span style="">31, </span><span style="">1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>named
to "Item No. 149(68), Page 23, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Reorg</span></span><span style="">. <span class="GramE">of</span> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> </span>pursuant to
RA 3808".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Effective <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="6">June <span style="">15,
 </span><span style="">1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>he was also "assigned as
Registrar for the 4th Dis­trict, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>",
and remained thereat until <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="5">May 21,
 1965</st1:date> when, like the <span style="">respondent
</span><span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, he was assigned to the Law De­partment
of the <span style="">respondent </span>Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the two peti­tioners, the above-named
respondents held positions corres­ponding to those of municipal registrars and
were all amongst the about fifty registrars assigned by the respondent Commis­<span style="">sion in </span>its saturation drive in the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of them, however, was then officially
appointed as election registrar specifically for the said city.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the validity of the appointments of election
registrars-at-large was challenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span><span class="SpellE">Buyat</span> vs.
Commission on Elections, G.R.L-24329, <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="4">April
 8, 1965</st1:date>, this Court ruled out said <span style="">appointments </span>as void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Collaterally, moves <span style="">in Con­</span>gress
for <span style="">a </span>more precise statement of
the legislative intent on the matter resulted in the passage of Republic Act
4730, effective June 18, <span style="">1966, </span>which
incorporated in section <span style="">3 </span>of the
Permanent Registration Act, Republic Act 3588, the qua­lification that -</p>

<blockquote>"* * * every election registrar shall be ap­pointed to a
specific city, municipality or muni­cipal district; and once appointed may not
be transferred or removed to another city, munici­pality or municipal district
without cause or his consent. * * *"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These developments
prompted the respondent Commission not only to reassess its policies in the
implementation of the new system of registration of voters but also to take immediate
steps to comply with the clear mandate of the </span><span style="">amendatory law </span>just adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realizing that, under the <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>
vs. Commission on Elections doctrine, even the ap­pointments of election
registrars without specification of station were equally illegal, and
recognizing that no appoint­ments to any place could be extended in excess of
the number of election registrars theretofore authorized by the current
appropriations act, the respondent Commission found no alter­native but to
appoint and/or disperse the then incumbent elec­tion registrars to specific
cities and municipalities as con­templated in the original reorganization
resolution of the respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The problem of choosing permanent sta­tions for said registrars was
particularly pressing in Manila where, despite the allotment thereto of only
four positions of election registrars, no less than fifty election registrars
have served or were serving as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
duly constituted screen­ing committee which analyzed the records of the said
fifty in­cumbent registrars and considered their respective Bar and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> examination ratings, academic background, training,
re­lated experience, performance and dependability, drew up a re­commendation
that the appointments of city election registrars for Manila be made from
amongst Enrique <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> Reyes,
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Verdejo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nestorio</span>
Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on this recommendation,
the respondent Commission, in its Re­solution of <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1966</st1:date>, resolved to permanently appoint as
"Election Registrars in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>",
effective <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1966</st1:date>,
the respondents <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verdejo</span> and Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In due season, their appointments as "Election Re­gistrar in the
Commission on Elections for Manila", respec­tively, under Items 177(2), 177(1),
177(3) and 177(4), all on page 2587, R.A. 4848, the General Appropriations Act
for <span style="">1966-</span>1967, were duly issued
by the respondent Commission and approved by the respondent Civil Service
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent registrars thereafter duly
qualified and assumed their respective offices.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Forthwith, in a
Memorandum dated September </span><span style="">6,
1966, </span><span style="">the respondent Commission
notified the forty-one other election registrars then detailed in Manila, the
petitioners herein included, of the appointment of the four respondent regis­trars
as permanent city election registrars for Manila, and directed them to turn
over to the latter such properties, equipment and unused registration forms as
they might still have under their respective accountabilities, as well as to
continue assisting the said permanent registrars in the </span><span style="">Ma­nila </span><span style="">Registrar's Office pending their permanent
appointments to specific cities or municipalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To a man, the said forty-one registrars
demurred and refused to heed the order aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regarding this as "disobedience to
lawful orders of superior authority and conduct prejudicial to the best in­terests
of the service, in violation of the Civil Service Law", </span>the
respondent Commission forthwith initiated administra­tive proceedings against
the said registrars, including the petitioners herein, and accordingly ordered
their prevent­ive suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
registrars' explanation and subsequent motion for reconsideration of the action
taken by the res­pondent Commission proved unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners, then, invoked our
intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, there are preliminary issues raised in the pleadings
which ordinarily deserve preferential resolution before the merits of the
petition are inquired into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever,
because several other cases posing the same principal question as that here
presented have been spawned by the same factual setting above laid out, we deem
it more profitable to forthwith take the case by its horns, so to speak, and
thereby set the principal issue at rest once and for all.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the petitioners' own formulation, the basic issue to be
resolved here is whether the action of the respondent Com­mission in ousting
them, and others like them, from their as­signments in Manila pending their
appointment to permanent stations, as well as in suspending and
administratively investigating them for their alleged disobedience heretofore
adverted to, is illegal and void, in excess of jurisdiction and grave abuse of
discretion for being a subversion of the permanence of station and security of
tenure contemplated by Republic Act 3588, as amended by Republic Act 4730, and
gua­ranteed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> of the petitioners' pose in sustaining the
affirmative side of this issue is that although their appointment papers did
not specify <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> <span style="">as </span>their
permanent station, their assignment thereto made them permanent election
registrars thereof and may not now be ousted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
without trenching upon their security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This point is deduced from the premise that
permanency of station being of the essence of the office of an election
registrar - as is implicit in the original Republic Act 3588, recognized in <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Commission on Elections, <u>supra.</u>, and categorically
expressed in the amendatory law, Republic Act 4730 - the pe­titioners'
appointments without indication of a specific sta­tion were defective and
ineffectual until they were comple­mented by corresponding assignments to
particular stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they
theorize that their subsequent assignment to <st1:city><st1:place>Ma­nila</st1:place></st1:city>
validated or perfected their appointments as ones for permanent election
registrars thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, they claim
to be entitled to seek refuge behind the right to security of tenure.</p>

<p class="BODY">That security of tenure is an essential and constitu­tionally guaranteed
feature of our Civil Service system, is not open to debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mantle of its protection extends not only
against removals without cause but also against <span class="SpellE">un­consented</span>
transfers which, as repeatedly enunciated, are tan­tamount to removals which are
within the ambit of the fundamental guarantee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the availability of that security of tenure necessarily
depends, in the first instance, upon "the nature of the appointment"
(<span class="SpellE">Hojilla</span> vs. Marino, et al., G.R.L-20574, February
26, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such that the rule which
proscribes transfers without consent <span style="">as
anathema </span>to the se­curity of tenure is predicated upon the theory that
the of­ficer involved is <u><span style="">appointed</span></u><span style=""> - </span>not merely <u><span style="">assigned</span></u><span style=""> - </span>to a particular station (<span class="SpellE">Miclat</span> vs.
<span class="SpellE">Ganaden</span>, et al., G.R.L-14459, May 30, 1960; <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Jaro</span></span><span style=""> </span>vs. Valencia, et al., G.R.L-18352,
August 30, 1963).</p>

<p class="BODY">Assayed upon the foregoing legal crucible, the peti­tioners' case
suffers an initial setback.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appointments upon which they respectively anchor their claim clearly state that
they were merely appointed as "Election Registrars in the Commission on
Elections".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere is it there
intimated, much less stated, to which city, municipality or municipal district
they are appointed as such registrars.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On top of this, it is there specifically indicated that they were to
fill Items 179(165) and 179(1271), page 2576, Republic Act 4642, both of which
correspond to positions of "municipal registrars".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­fore, by these appointments - which, as
aforesaid, are per­force controlling - there can be no gainsaying the fact that
the petitioners were not appointed to, and consequently not entitled to any
security of tenure or permanence in, any spe­cific station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On general principles, they may be transfer­red
as the exigencies of the service require.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They ordinarily have no right to complain against any change of
assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is that the said appointments may be of doubt­ful
regularity in view of the essential nature of the office of an election
registrar contemplated by Republic Act <span style="">3588,
</span>as amended by Republic Act 4730.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the petitioners themselves insinuate that the said appointments
were ini­tially defective but were validated upon their subsequent assignments
to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
</span>definitely off-tangent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
subscribe to the theory that an assignment to a par­ticular station, in the
light of the terms of the appoint­ments in question, was necessary to complete
the said ap­pointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The approval
thereof by the Commissioner of Civil Service gave those appointments the stamp
of finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the view that the
respondent Commission then took of its power in the premises and the demands of
the mission it set out to accomplish with the appointments it extended, said
appointments were definitely meant to be complete <span style="">as </span>then issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
subsequent assignment of the appointees <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
that the said respondent Commission held in re­serve to be exercised as the
needs of each locality justified did not in may way detract from the perfection
attained by the appointments beforehand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the respective appointees were entitled only to such security of
tenure as the appoint­ment papers concerned actually conferred - not in that of
any place to which they may have been subsequently assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is particularly true in the case at bar where
the offices filled by the petitioners were those of "municipal regis­trars",
whereas the <span style="">assignments given </span>to
them were stations corresponding to "city registrars" - which they
were not - co­vered by item numbers in the current appropriations act which are
altogether different from those stated in their respec­tive appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As things stand, in default of any parti­cular
station stated in their respective appointments, no se­curity of tenure can be
asserted by the petitioners on the ba­sis of the mere assignments which were
given to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A con­trary rule will
erase altogether the demarcation line we have <span style="">repeatedly drawn between </span><u><span style="">appointment</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and </span><u>assignment</u> <span style="">as </span><span style="">two distinct concepts in the law of public officers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor is there necessity to
dwell at length on the vali­dity of </span><span style="">the appointments extended </span><span style="">to
the petitioners which do not state any specific station contrary to the spirit
and expressed mandate of the Permanent Registration Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, having accepted said
appointments as they are and having reaped benefits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
they cannot now be heard to impugn their validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, whichever way the verdict on the
question of validity may go, the petitioners will profit </span><span style="">nothing </span><span style="">by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Were </span><span style="">we </span><span style="">to uphold </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">appoint­ments, the petitioners' cause will necessarily fail because, as
aforesaid, the same </span><span style="">involves </span><span style="">not an appointment to a particular station
but a mere assignment to a certain place in the interest of the <span class="GramE">service.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
other hand, striking down said appointments as void would virtually pull </span><span style="">the rug from under the petitioners'
feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, a void appointment confers no
rights whatsoever except, perhaps, </span><span style="">those
recog</span>nized under the <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> doctrine, but definitely
never so far as to entitle the incumbent to take shelter under the aegis of the
guarantee of security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
the res­pondent Commission may have erred in extending the defec­tively
formulated appointments relied upon is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span><span style="">mistake, acquiescence and tolerance </span><span style="">of the proper </span><span style="">officials </span>resulting in the non-observance of legal requirements
do not bestow upon the petitioners any right to the positions <span style="">in </span>question or to the guarantees
provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As appro­priately
observed elsewhere -</p>

<blockquote>"* * * In the circumstances, for the dura­tion of his occupancy
of the position in ques­tion, the petitioner may be considered merely as a <u>de</u>
<u>facto</u> officer, and may consequently be removed from office even without
cause." <span class="GramE"><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Favis</span> </span>vs. <span class="SpellE">Rupisan</span>, et al.,
G.R.L-22823, <span style="">May </span>19, 1966).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Then,
if said appointments were void, no number of assignments given to the
appointees <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> could have vali­dated the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once void, they remained so and
could have been corrected only by subsequent valid reappointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, </span>no pretense is made by the
petitioners to any validating ap­pointments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, they pray - as an alternative relief - that, if new
appointments are required, they be extended new ones <span style="">as </span>permanent election registrars of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to which they insist they have a preferred right.</p>

<p class="BODY">But this cannot be done either.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances at bar, the petitioners have established no
right whatsoever, in preference to anyone, to the positions aspired for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may have been performing duties as city
election registrars, it <span style="">is </span>conceded.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>But -</p>

<blockquote>"* * * one may not claim a right to an office, position or
employment subject to the civil service laws merely because he is performing
the duties of the office, position or employment".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(67 C.J.S., 174).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Worse still, only forty-three positions
for city election re­gistrars have been provided for, four of which are
allotted to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as the petitioners would have it, they
and their colleagues who are assigned in Manila are all entitled to remain as
permanent election registrars thereat, then, not only will they be perpetuated
in inexistent offices, but also all other cities in the Philippines will be
left without any election registrars at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, it cannot be seriously contended that the respondent
Commission could, even if it wanted to, validly appoint forty-one permanent
city election registrars for Manila alone when only four have been legally
allotted thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less can it
successfully be maintained that the said petitioners should be appointed as
permanent city election registrars of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
inasmuch as, anyway, the corres­ponding budgetary authority and provision <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> can always be subsequently made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the petitioners overlook that such
authority is exclusively discretionary for Congress to provide, and it would be
asking us to tread upon a forbidden domain to have us command the respondent
Commission to make the desired appointments on the assumption that Congress
could later be obliged to make provisions <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So also, the respondent Commission can hardly
be begrudged <span style="">for </span>its efforts at
recti­fying as soon as it can the evident defects in the appoint­ments it had
previously extended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only meet
that it should correct itself if its error is exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since none of the contenders had theretofore
been extended any appoint­ment as permanent city election registrar for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
it is not for us to say who should be so appointed from amongst the candidates <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
respondent Commission is primarily entrusted the discretion to make the
choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had a whole field of about
fifty people, all similarly si­tuated, to choose from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we scan the guidelines adopted by its
screening committee for this purpose, we see no evi­dence of discrimination or
favoritism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choices were made <span style="">in keeping with the criteria laid down and
are justified by the comparative records relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, <span class="SpellE"><u>vis</u>-<u>a</u>-<u>vis</u></span>
the petitioners herein, the chosen four respond­ents </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">ruly
</span><span style="">appear to have a definite
edge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, we find no
cause to declare that the respondent Com­mission in any way abused its
discretion in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
heretofore conceded that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The power to appoint is in essence discre­tionary on the part
of the proper authority, in this case the head of the department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointing power has the right of choice
which he may exercise freely according to his judgment, deciding for himself
who is best qualified for <span style="">any
competitive position in the </span>Civil Service." <span class="GramE"><span style="">(Jimenez vs. Francisco, et al., G.R.L-9699, </span>Feb­<span style="">ruary 28, 1957).</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">We
have been shown no reason to sanction a departure from this salutary rule and
to substitute our own discretion for that of the respondent Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners' case
flounders upon still another ve­ritable legal shoal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not pretend to have been named to the
same positions as the respondent </span>registrars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their <span style="">subsisting
appointments are to positions of "municipal re­gistrars".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most they can muster is to assert a right
to be appointed to the posts of permanent "city election registrars"
for </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
yet, while they impugn the appointments of the four respondent registrars as
such, they do not say which of the four are actually usurping the positions
supposedly pertaining to the two of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Decisive in this posture are the following pronouncements:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Thus, one who does not claim to be enti­tled to the office
allegedly usurped or unlaw­fully held or exercised by another cannot ques­tion
his title thereto by quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, petitioners do not claim
to be en­titled to the office held by respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of them has been appointed thereto and
none of them may, therefore, be placed in said of­fice, regardless of the
alleged flaws in the respondent's title thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="">merely
as­sert </span>a right to be appointed to <span class="GramE">said</span> office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, however, that there are seven
(7) petitioners and that only one (1) office is in­volved in this case, none of
them can, or does, give an assurance that he will be the one ap­pointed by the
President, should said office be declared vacant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the claim of each <span style="">petitioner is predicated solely upon a more
or less remote possibility that, in said event, he may be the recipient of the
appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious, therefore,
that none of them has a cause of action against respondent herein (Acosta vs. <span class="SpellE">Flor</span>, 5 Phil. 18, 22; <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> Luna
vs. Rodriguez, </span><span style="">36 </span><span style="">Phil. 401; <span class="SpellE">Nueno</span>

<blockquote>"An individual cannot sue and oust two or more persons
although the latter are holding il­legally their respective offices, unless he
is entitled to all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
this ques­tion has not been raised by the parties, we may rest our decision on
that ground alone and dis­miss the action; for if we were to decide this case
in favor of the petitioners, we would be at a loss to determine which of the
six respondents should be ousted as holding illegally the four offices or
places claimed by the four petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is <span style="">nothing </span>in the
record showing which of the six respondents occupy the four seats or of­fices
formerly occupied by the four petitioners." (<span class="SpellE">Nueno</span>
vs. Angeles, 76 Phil., 12, 21).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rest is a foregone conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Commission was well within its
province in proceeding as it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the petitioners' defiance of its lawful directive, the said respondent
Commission rightly called upon them to account.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its order suspending the petitioners pending the ad­ministrative
investigation initiated to that end cannot be denounced as a denial of due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a mere preserva­tive
measure - not a penal <span style="">sanction - </span>said
suspension may be resorted to without need of prior notice or opportunity to be
heard (<span class="SpellE">Cornejo</span> vs. Gabriel, 41 Phil., 188).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the end, we hold that
