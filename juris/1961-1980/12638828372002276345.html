				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Philippine National Bank (hereafter referred to as the
petitioner), on January 16, 1963, granted in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Fabar</span> Incorporated various credit accommodations and
advances in the form of a discounting line, overdraft line, temporary overdraft
line and <span class="GramE">letters</span> of credit covering the importation of
machinery and equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
likewise made advances by way of insurance premiums covering the chattels
subject matter of a mortgage securing the aforementioned credit accommodations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said credit accommodations had an outstanding
balance of P8<span class="GramE">,449,169.98</span> as of <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the above credit accommodations are secured by the joint
and several signatures of Jose Ma. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Barredo</span></span><span class="GramE">, Carmen B. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and Tomas L. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> (private respondents herein) and Manuel H. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
failure of private respondents to pay their obligations notwithstanding
repeated demands, petitioner instituted a case for collection against all
private respondents and Manuel H. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in a complaint
dated October 31, 1972, and which was filed before the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
of the Honorable Elias B. Asuncion, Judge of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch XII (hereafter referred to as the respondent Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1975</st1:date>,
before the case could be decided, Manuel H. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a Manifestation dated <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1975</st1:date>, counsel for private
respondents informed the respondent Court of said death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, respondent Court issued an Order of dismissal dated
<st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1976</st1:date>, which
is <span class="GramE">herein-below</span> quoted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the death of defendant Manuel <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
the Court hereby dismisses this case since the present suit is for a money
claim which does not survive the death of said defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to the provisions of Section 6, Rule 86 of the
Revised Rules of Court, which provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Where the obligation of the decedent is <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
with another debtor, the claim shall be filed against, the decedent as if he
were the only debtor, without prejudice to the <span style="">right of the estate to recover contribution from the </span>other
debtor x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">the</span> claim of
plaintiff <span style="">may </span>be filed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with the estate proceedings of the
decedent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner thereupon filed a Motion dated <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1976</st1:date> praying for the
reconsideration of respondent Court's Order dismissing the case as against all
the defendants, contending that the dismissal should only be as against the
deceased defendant Manuel H. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="26" month="1">January
 26, 1977</st1:date>, respondent Court denied petitioner's motion for
reconsideration for lack of meritorious grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, this instant
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner, in its lone
assignment of error, alleged that the respondent Court erred in dismissing the
case against all the defendants, instead of dis­missing the case only as
against the deceased defendant and thereafter proceeding with the hearing as
against the other defendants, private respondents herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's contention
is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court's
reliance on Section 6, Rule 86 of the Revised Rules of Court was erroneous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A cursory perusal of Section 6, Rule 86 of the Revised Rules of
Court reveals that nothing therein prevents a creditor from proceeding against
the surviving <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said provision merely sets up the procedure
in enforcing collection in case a creditor chooses to pursue his claim against
the estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">rule
has been set forth that a creditor (in a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
obligation) has the option whether to file or not to file a claim against the
estate of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In construing Section 6, Rule 87 of the old
Rules of Court, which is the precursor of Section 6, Rule 86 of the Revised
Rules of Court, this Court<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>said, in the
case of Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>,
et al. (107 Phil. 891) that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is evident from the foregoing that Section 6 of Rule 87
(of the <u>Old</u> Rules of Court) provides the procedure should the creditor
desire to go against the deceased debtor, but there is cer­tainly nothing in
the said provision making compliance with such procedure a condition precedent
before an ordinary action against the surviving debtors, should the creditor
choose to demand payment from the latter, could be entertained to the extent
that failure to observe the same would deprive the court jurisdiction to take
cognizance of the action against the surviving debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon <span style="">the
other hand, the Civil Code expressly allows the creditor to proceed against any
one of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors or some or all of them
simultaneously."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is crystal clear that Article 1216 of the New Civil Code is
the applicable provision in this matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said provision gives the creditor the right to "proceed against
anyone of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors or some or all of them
simultaneously." The choice is undoubtedly left to the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
creditor to determine against whom he will enforce collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of the death of one of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors, he (the creditor) may, if he so <span class="GramE">chooses,</span> proceed ag<span style="">a</span>inst
the surviving <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors without necessity of
filing a claim in the estate of the deceased debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not mandatory for him to have the case
dismissed as against the sur­viving debtors and file its claim against the
estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtor, as was made
apparent in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For to require the creditor to proceed
against the estate, making it a condition precedent for any collection action
against the surviving debtors to prosper, would deprive him of his substantive
rights provided by Article 1216 of the New Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As correctly argued by
petitioner, if Section 6, Rule 86 of the Revised Rules of Court were applied
literally, Article 1216 of the New Civil Code would, in effect, be repealed
since under the Rules of Court, petitioner has no choice but to proceed against
the estate of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> </span><span style="">only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Obviously, this provision diminishes the
Bank's right under the New Civil Code to proceed against any one, some or all
of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a construction is not sanctioned </span>by
the <span style="">principle, which is too well
settled to require citation, that a substantive law cannot be amended by a
procedural, </span>rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
stated, Section 6, Rule 86 of the Revised Rules of Court cannot be made to
prevail over Article 1216 of the New Civil Code, the former being merely
procedural, while the latter, substantive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, no less than the New Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in Section 5, Article <span class="GramE">X,</span> provides that rules
promulgated by the Supreme Court should not diminish, increase or modify
substantive rights.</p>
