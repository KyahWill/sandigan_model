<p class="BODY">The record shows that at the time Civil Case No. 2012 was
commenced in the court below, appel<span style="">lant
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santiago, Jr. was a pupil in Grade Six at the
public school named </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sero</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Elementary School</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> in <span class="SpellE">Co­tabato</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As the school year
1964-1965 was then about to end, the "Committee On The Rating Of Students
For Honor" was constituted by the teachers concerned at said school for
the purpose of selecting the "honor students" of its graduating
class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the school Principal, Mrs.
Aurora Lorena, as chairman, and Juanita Bautista, Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Alpas</span>,
Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Matugas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Milkita</span> <span class="SpellE">Inamac</span>, Romeo Agustin, Aida Camino and Luna <span class="SpellE">Sarmago</span>, as mem­bers, the above-named committee deliberated
and finally adjudged Socorro Medina, Patricia <span class="SpellE">Liñgat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> C. Santiago, Jr. as first, second and
third honors, res­pectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
school's graduation exercises were there­after set for May 21, 1965; but three
days before that date, the "third placer" <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Santiago, Jr., represent­ed by his mother, and with his father as counsel,
sought the invalidation of the "ranking of honor students" thus made,
by <span style="">instituting </span>the <span style="">above-mentioned civil case in </span>the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, against the
above-named committee members along with the District Supervisor and the
Academic Supervisor of the place.</p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding complaint filed alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that
plaintiff-petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> C. Santiago, Jr. is a
sixth grader at the <span class="SpellE">Sero</span> Elementary School in <span class="SpellE">Cota­bato</span> City scheduled to be graduated on May 21st, 1965
with the <u>honor rank of third place</u>, which <span style="">is </span>disputed; that the teachers of the school had been made respond­ents
as they compose the "Committee on the Rating of Students for Honor"
whose grave abuse of official dis­cretion is the subject of suit, while the
other defend­ants were included as Principal, District Supervisor and Academic
Supervisor of the school; that <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santiago, Jr.
had been a consistent honor <span style="">pupil from
Grade </span>I to Grade V of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sero</span></span><span style=""> Elementary
School, while Patricia <span class="SpellE">Liñgat</span> (second placer in the
disputed ranking in Grade VI) had never been a close rival of petitioner
before, except in Grade V wherein she ranked third; that Santiago, </span>Jr.
had been prejudiced, while his closest <span style="">rival
had </span>been so much benefited, by the circumstance that the latter, Socorro
Medina, was coached and tutored during the summer vacation of 1964 by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alpas</span> who became the teacher of both pupils in English in
Grade VI, resulting in the far lead Medina obtained over the other pupil; that
the committee referred to in this case had been illegally constituted as the
same was composed of all the Grade VI teachers only, in vio­lation of the
Service Manual for Teachers of the <span style="">Bureau
</span><span style="">of Public Schools which provides
that the committee to select the honor students should be composed of all
teachers in Grades V and VI; that there are direct and circumstantial matters,
which shall be proven during the trial, wherein <span style="">respondents have exercised grave abuse </span>of discretion and
irregularities, such as the changing of the <span style="">final ratings on the grading sheets of </span>Socorro Medina and Patricia
<span class="SpellE">Liñgat</span> from 80% to 85%, </span>and some teachers <span style="">giving petitioner a starting grade of </span>75%
in Grade VI, which prove, that there was already an intention to pull him to a <span style="">much lower rank at the end </span>of the
school year; that <span style="">several district
examinations outside of teachers' daily units and other than period­ical tests
were given, ratings in which were heavily considered in the determination of
periodical ratings, </span>whereas according to the <span style="">Academic Supervisor and Acting Division Superintendent of schools of the
place such district examinations were not advisable; that there was a unanimous
agreement and understanding among the res­</span>pondent teachers to insult and
prejudice the second and <span style="">third honors
by rating Socorro Medina with </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">perfect score, which is very
unnatural; that the words "first place" in petitioner's certificate <span style="">in Grade I was erased </span>and replaced
with the words "second place", which <span style="">is an </span>instance of the unjust and discriminating abuses commit­ted
by the respondent teachers in the disputed selection of honor pupils they made;
that petitioner personally appealed the matter to the School Principal, to the
District Supervisor, and to the Academic Supervisor, but said officials
"passed the buck to <span style="">each
other" to delay his grievances, and </span>as to appeal to higher
authorities will be too late, there <span style="">is </span>no
other speedy and adequate remedy under the circumstances; and, that petitioner
and his parents suffered mental and moral damages in the amount of
P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed the court, among
others, to set aside the final list of honor students in Grade VI of the <span class="SpellE">Sero</span> Elementary School for that school year 1964-1965, and,
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of <span style="">the suit, to enjoin </span>the respondent teachers from officially and
formally publishing and proclaiming the said honor <span style="">pupils in Grade VI </span>in the graduation exercises the school was
scheduled to hold on the 21st of May of <span style="">that
year 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injunction prayed </span>for
was denied by the lower court in its order of May 20, 1965, the said court
reasoning out that the graduation exercises were then already set </span>on the
following day, May 21, 1965, <span style="">and the
restraining </span><span style="">of the same would be
shocking to the school authorities, parents, and the community who had eagerly
looked for­ward to the coming of that yearly happy event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As sche­duled, the graduation exercises of
the <span class="SpellE">Sero</span> Elementary School for the school year
1964-1965 was held on May 21, with the same protested list of honor students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Having been required by
the above-mentioned order <span style="">to </span>answer
the petition within ten (10) days, respondents moved for the dismissal of the
case instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under date of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="5"><span style="">May 24,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, they filed <span style="">a </span>motion to dismiss, on the grounds
(1) that the action for <i>certiorari</i> was improper, and (2) that even
assuming the propriety of the action, the question brought before the court had
already become academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
opposed by petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an order dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="6"><span style="">June 4,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the motion to
dismiss of respondents was granted, the court reasoning thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The respondents now move to dismiss the petition for being
improper and for being academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
order to resolve the motion to dismiss, the Court has carefully examined the
petition to de­termine the sufficiency of the alleged cause of action constituting
the spe­cial civil action of <i>certiorari</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The pertinent portions of the peti­tion alleging 'grave abuse
of discret­ion' are found in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, <span style="">8, </span>9 and 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
allegations may be substantially summarized <span style="">as </span>fol­lows: Paragraph 3 alleges that
since grades one to six, the students closely contending for class honors were
Socorro Medina, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santiago, <span style="">Jr., </span>Do­<span style="">lores <span class="SpellE">Dalican</span> and
Patricia <span class="SpellE">Liñgat</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Socorro <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>
obtained first honor thrice (grades I, V and VI); once se­cond honor (grade <span style="">IV), </span>and twice third place (grades II
and III).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santiago, Jr. obtained
first place once (grade IV); four times second place (grades I, II, III and V)
and once third place (grade VI).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dolores <span class="SpellE">Dalican</span> obtained twice
first place (grades II, III); once third place (grade I).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Patricia <span class="SpellE">Liñgat</span> once third place
(grade V); and once second place (grade VI).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That as now ranked in the gradua­tion, Patricia <span class="SpellE">Liñgat</span> is given second place while <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Santiago, Jr., is given the third place only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is <span style="">the ranking now disputed
by petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Santiago, Jr.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 4 alleges that Socorro Medina was tutored in the
summer of 1964 by Mrs. Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Alpas</span> who be­came
her English teacher in the sixth grade; that as such, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Alpas</span>
un­justly favored Socorro against her rivals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 5 alleges that the teach­ers who composed the
committee on honor students are all grade six teachers while the Service Manual
For Teachers provides that the committee shall be composed of the teachers from
the fifth and sixth grades.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 6 alleges that there are direct and circumstantial
evidence show­ing the change of ratings of Socorro Medina and Patricia <span class="SpellE">Liñgat</span> from 80% to 85% and the intention to <span style="">junk </span>petition<span style="">er to a lower rank.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 7 alleges that the giving of district examinations
upon which ratings were partly based were not advis­able.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Paragraph <span style="">8 </span>alleges
that the teach­ers rated Socorro Medina a perfect pu­pil which is unnatural.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 9 alleges that on the first grade certificate of
the <span style="">peti­</span>tioner the word '<st1:street><st1:address>First
  Place</st1:address></st1:street>' was erased and changed to '<st1:street><st1:address>Second
  Place</st1:address></st1:street>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 10 alleges that petitioner personally appealed to
the school autho­rities but they only 'passed the <span style="">buck </span>to each other'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>SECOND PARAGRAPH
VIOLATED</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rule 65, Section 1 of the <span style="">Rules of </span>Court provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When any tri­bunal, board, or officer ex­ercising
judicial functions, has acted without or in excess of, its or his jurisdic­tion,
or with grave abuse of discretion and there is no appeal, nor any plain,
speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved
thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court alleging the facts
with certainty and praying that judgment be rend­ered annulling or modifying
the proceedings, as the law requires, of such tribunal, board or officer.'</p>

<p class="2Q">'The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the
judgment or order subject thereof, to­gether with copies of all pleadings and
documents rele­vant and pertinent thereto.'</p>

<blockquote>"It is striking, indeed, that this petition has not been
accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment or order complained of,
together with all pleadings and documents which are rele­vant thereto, as
required by the second paragraph of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This violation renders the
petition extremely indefinite and uncertain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no written formal judgment or order of re­spondents that is
submitted for revision or correction of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This vio­lation is fatal to the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>ADMINISTRATIVE
REMEDIES NEGLECTED</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"All that the petition alleges is that the petitioner
personally appealed to the school authorities who only 'passed the buck to each
other'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation does not show
that petitioner formally availed <span style="">of and
exhausted the administrative re­medies of the Department of Education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition implies that this <span style="">is </span>the 'first formal complaint of
petitioner against his teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
administra­tive agencies of the Department of Edu­cation could have
investigated the grievances of the petitioner with dis­patch and give effective
remedies, but petitioner negligently abandoned them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner cannot now claim that he lacked
any plain, speedy and adequate remedy.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>NO GRAVE ABUSE OF
DISCRETION</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Allegations relating to the alleged 'grave abuse of
discretion' on the part of teachers refer to errors, mistakes, or
irregularities rather than to real grave abuse of <span style="">discretion that would amount to </span>lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere commission of errors in the exercise of
jurisdiction may not be corrected by means of <i>certiorari</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the Court is of the opinion, and so
holds, that the petition states no cause of action and should be, as it is
hereby dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of a copy of the above-quoted order, the petitioner
moved for the reconsideration thereof, but the <span style="">same </span>proved to <span style="">be futile, hence, this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant
here assails the holding of the lower court that his petition states no cause
of action on the grounds - discussed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">in the ap­</span><span style="">pealed order above-quoted - (1) that the
petition does not comply with the second paragraph of Sec. 1 of Rule 65 because
it has not been accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment or order
subject thereof, to­gether with copies of all pleadings and documents relevant
and pertinent thereto; (2) that administrative re­medies were not first
exhausted; and (3) that there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the teachers who constituted the committee referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
maintain that the court below did not err, in dismissing the case on said
grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, they, </span><span style="">argue in favor of the questioned order of
dismissal upon the additional ground that the "committee on the ratings of
students for honor" whose actions are here condemned by appellant is <u>not</u>
the "tribunal, board or officer <span style="">ex</span>ercising
judicial functions" against which an action for <i>certiorari</i> may lie
under Section 1 of Rule 65.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The last point raised by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> deserves first consideration, for if really the
said committee of teach­ers does not fall within the category of the <u>tribunal,
</u></span><u><span style="">board, </span></u><u><span style="">or officer exercising judicial functions </span></u><span style="">contem­plated by Rule 65, further discussion
of the issues raised by appellant may no longer be necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To re­solve this problem the following tests
may be employed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In this jurisdiction <i>certiorari</i> is a special civil
action instituted against 'any tribunal, board, or offi­cer exercising judicial
functions.' (Section 1, Rule 67.) A judicial function is an act performed by
vir­tue of judicial powers; the exercise of a judicial function is the doing of
something in the nature of the action of the court (34 C.J. 1182).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order that a special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>
may be invoked in this jurisdiction the following circum­stances must exist:
(1) that there must be <span style="">a </span>specific
controversy in­volving rights of persons or property and said controversy <span style="">is </span>brought be­fore a tribunal, board
or officer for hearing and determination of their respective rights and
obligations.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Judicial action is an ad­judication upon the rights of parties who
in general appear or are brought before the tri­bunal by notice or process, and
upon whose claims some de­cision or judgment is rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It implies impartiality, disin­terestedness,
a weighing of adverse claims, and is incon­sistent with discretion on the one
hand - for the tribunal must decide according to law and the rights of the
parties - or with dictation on the other; for in the first instance it <span style="">must exercise its own judg­ment under the
law, and not act under a mandate from a­nother power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The character of its action in a given case must decide
whether that action is judi­cial, ministerial, or legis­lative, or whether it
be simply that of a public agent of the county or State, as in its varied
jurisdictions it may by turns be each.' (In Re Saline County Subscription, 100
Am. Dec. 337, 338, cited in Southeastern Greyhound Lines v. Georgia Public Ser­vice
Commission, 181 S. E. 836-837.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'It may be said generally that the exercise of judicial function is
to determine what the law is, and what the legal rights of parties are, with
respect to a matter in contro­versy; and whenever an officer is clothed with
that authority, and undertakes to determine those questions, he acts judi­<span style="">cially.' (State ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Board of Commissioners of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">St. </span><span style="">Louis</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype>County</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
et al. v. Dunn, 90 N. W. 772-773.)</p>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the tribunal, board or officer before whom
the controversy <span style="">is </span>brought must
have the power and authority to pronounce judg­ment and render a decision on the
contro­versy construing and applying the laws to that end.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The phrase "judicial power" is not capable of a precise
de­finition which would be applica­ble to all cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term has been variously defined as the
authority to determine the rights of persons or property by arbi­trating
between adversaries in specific controversies at the in­stance of a party
thereto; the authority exercised by that de­partment of government which <span style="">is </span><span style="">charged with the declaration of what the law is and its construction so
far </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">written </span><span style="">law; the authority or power vested in the
judges or in the courts; the authority vested in some court, officer, or
persons to hear and deter­mine when the rights of per­sons or property or the
pro­priety of doing an act is the subject matter of adjudication; the power
belonging to or ema­nating from a judge </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">such; the power conferred </span><span style="">upon
a pub­</span><span style="">lic officer, involving the
ex­ercise of judgment and discret­ion in the determination of questions of
right in specific cases affecting the interest of persons or property, as
distin­guished from ministerial power or authority to carry out the mandates of
judicial power or of the law; the power exercised by courts in hearing and
determi­ning cases before them, or some matter incidental thereto, and of which
they have jurisdiction; the power of a court to decide and pronounce a
judgment; the power which adjudicates upon and protects the rights and
interests of individual citizens, and to that end construes and applies the
law. "Judicial </span><span style="">power"
implies the construction of laws and the adjudication of legal rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It includes the power to hear and determine
but not everyone </span><span style="">who may hear
and deter­mine has judicial power. The term "judicial power" does not
necessarily include the power to hear and determine a matter that </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not in the nature of a suit or action </span><span style="">between </span><span style="">the parties.' (34 C.J. 1183-1184)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the tribunal, board or officer <span style="">must per­tain </span>to that branch of the <span style="">sovereign power which </span>belongs to the
judiciary, or at least, which does not belong to the legislative or executive
department.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> the distinction between
legislative or minis­terial functions and judicial functions is difficult to
point out. What is a judicial function does not depend solely upon the mental
operation by which it is performed or the importance of the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sol­ving this question, due regard must be
had to the organic law of the state and the division of power of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span style="">discharge of executive and legislative
duties, the exercise of discretion and judgment of the highest order is
necessary, and matters of the greatest weight and importance are dealt
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough to make a
function judicial that it re­quires discretion, deliberation, thought, and
judgment. </span><u><span style="">It must be the exercise of discretion and judgment within that subdi­vision
of the sovereign power which belongs to the judiciary, or, at least, which does
not be­long to the legislative or exe­cutive department</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">If the matter, in respect to which it is exercised, belongs to either of
the two last-named departments of government, it is not judicial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>to
what is judicial and what is not seems to be better indi­cated by the nature of
<span style="">a </span>thing, than its definition.'

thereto, in connection with the law as to the right to a writ of <i>cer<span style="">tiorari</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is clear, however, that it

honor whose actions are questioned in this case exer­cised neither judicial nor
quasi judicial functions in the performance of its assigned task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the above-quoted portions of the
decisions cited, it will be gleaned that before a tribunal, board, or officer
may exercise judicial or quasi judicial acts, it is neces­sary, that there be a
law that gives rise to some speci­fic rights of persons or property under which
adverse claims to such rights are made, and the controversy ensuing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> is brought, in turn, before the tribunal, board
or officer clothed with power and authority to determine what that law is and
thereupon adjudicate the respective rights of the contending parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> however, there is nothing on record about
any rule of law that provides that when teachers sit down to assess the
individual merits of their pu­pils for purposes of rating them for honors, such
func­tion involves the determination of what the law is and that they are
therefore automatically vested with judi­cial or quasi judicial functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, this Court has not even been
apprised by appellant of the pertinent provisions of the Service Manual of
Teachers for Public Schools <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> allegedly
violated in the composition of the committee they constituted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, and, in the performance of that committee's
duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, the
situation brought before Us in this case, <span class="SpellE">tho</span>
seemingly one of first impression, is not without substantial parallel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Felipe vs. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>,
etc., et al.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">the issue presented for de­termination was
whether or not the courts have the autho­rity to reverse the award of the board
of judges of an oratorical contest, and this Court declared that the judiciary
has no power to reverse the award of the board of judges of that contest and,
for that matter, it would not interfere in literary contests, beauty contests
and similar competitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
reasoned out thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"For more </span>than
thirty years orato<span style="">­</span>rical tilts
have been held periodically by schools and colleges in this islands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inter-collegiate oratorical <span style="">competitions are of more recent ori­gin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Members of this court have taken part in them
either as con­testants in their school days (In the College of Law, U. P. annual
oratorical contest, first prize was awarded to Justice <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>
in 1914 and to Justice Labrador in 1916), or as members of the board of judges
afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They know some (few)
verdicts did not reflect the audience's preference and that errors have
sometimes been ascribed to the award of the judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet no party ever presumed to invoke judi­cial
intervention; for it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">unwrit­ten law in such contests that the board's decision is final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Like the ancient tournaments of the Sword, these tournaments
of the Word apply the highest tenets of sportsmanship:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>finality of the referee's verdict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No alibis, no mur­murs of protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The participants are supposed to join the
competition to contribute to its success by striving their utmost:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the prizes are se­condary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"No rights to the prizes may be asserted by the contestants,
because <span class="SpellE">their's</span> was merely the privilege to compete
for the prize, and that privilege did not ripen into <span style="">a </span>demand­able right unless and until
they were proclaimed winners of the competition by the appointed arbiters or
referees or judges.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Incidentally, these school activities have been imported from
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We found in American jurisprudence no
litigation questioning the determination of the board of judges.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Now, the fact that a particular action has had no precedent
during a long period affords some reason for doubting the existence of the
right <span style="">sought to be enforced, especially
</span><span style="">where occasion for its assertion
must have often arisen; and courts are cautious before allowing it, being loath
to establish a new legal prin­ciple not in harmony with the gene­rally accepted
views thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See C.J.S. Vol. 1, p.
1012.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We observe that in assuming ju­risdiction over the matter,
the res­pondent judge reasoned out that where there <span style="">is </span>a wrong there is a remedy and that courts of first ins­tance
are courts of general juris­diction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The flaw in his reasoning lies in the assumption that
Imperial suf­fered some <u>wrong</u> at the hands of the board of judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, there was <u>error</u> on the part
of one judge, at most.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Error and wrong
do not <span style="">mean the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Wrong' as used in the aforesaid legal
principle <span style="">is </span>the deprivation or
violation of a right. As stated before, a contest­ant <u>has no right</u> to
the prize unless and until he or she <span style="">is
</span>declared win­ner by the board of referees or judges.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Granting that Imperial suffered some loss or injury, yet in
law there are instances of '<span class="SpellE">damnum</span> <span class="SpellE">absque</span> <span class="SpellE">injuria</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
</span>one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If fraud or malice
had been proven, it would be a different proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then her action should be directed
against the individual judge or jud­ges who fraudulently or maliciously injured
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not against the other judges."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But even were We to
assume for the moment, as the court below apparently did, that judicial
intervention might be sought in cases of this nature, still, We are inclined to
sustain the order of dismissal appealed from for failure on the part of
appellant to comply with the requirements of Section 1 of Rule 65.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the lower court's holding that
appellant's failure </span><span style="">to accompany
his petition with <span style="">a copy </span>of the
judgment or order subject thereof together with copies of all pleadings and
documents relevant and pertinent thereto "is fatal to his cause" is
supported not only by the provi­sion of that Rule but by precedents as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Alajar</span>
et al. vs. Court of Industrial Relations,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where it was claimed by therein petitioners
that the re­spondent court had acted with grave abuse of discretion in estimating
certain rice harvests involved in the case in terms of <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
instead of cans, allegedly in complete disregard of the decision of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> in Expropriation
Proceedings No. 84, and of this Court in <span style="">G.</span>R.
No. L-6191,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and in ordering there­after the division of
the said rice harvests on the ratio of 70-30 in favor of the tenants, this
Court denied the petition for certiorari on the ground, among others, of
failure on the part of said petitioners to attach to their petition copies of
the decisions allegedly violated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Speaking thru Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes then, this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The petition is patently without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is not even sufficient
in form and sub­stance to justify the issuance of the writ of <i>certiorari</i>
prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It charges that the Court of
Indus­trial Relations abused its discret­ion in disregarding the decision of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ba­tangas</span> in
Expropriation Proceedings No. 84 and of this Court in G. R. No. L-6191; yet it
does not attach to the petition the decisions al­legedly violated by the Court
below and point out <span style="">which </span>particular
por­tion or portions thereof have been disregarded by the respondent
Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The same principle was
applied in the more recent case of NAWASA vs. </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Libmanan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, et al.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">wherein

emphasized the importance </span><span style="">of
complying with the said requirement of Rule 65:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"While paragraph 3 of the petition speaks of the complaint
filed by the respondent municipality with the respondent court for recovery of
pro­perty with damages (Civil Case No. L-161), no copy thereof <span style="">is </span>attached to the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Similarly, paragraph 4 of the pe­tition mentions the decision
rendered by the respondent court on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1965</st1:date>, but no copy thereof is attached to the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again, paragraph 5 of the petition speaks of the order of
default entered by the respondent court and of the motion for reconsideration
filed by peti­tioner in the case above-mentioned, but no copy of the order of
default <span style="">is </span>at­tached to the
petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Bearing in mind that the petition under consideration was
filed for the purpose of enjoining the respondent court from executing the
decision rend­ered in Civil Case No. L-161, the im­portance of the missing
pleadings <span style="">is </span>obvious.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the petition <span style="">is </span>also for the purpose of securing an order com­manding the
respondent court to approve either the original or the amended re­cord on
appeal filed by petitioner, but no copy of either <span style="">is </span>attached to its petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the petition under consideration is
dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It might be true, as pointed out by appellant, that he received <span style="">a </span>copy of the programmer of the
graduation exercises held by the <span class="SpellE">Sero</span> Elementary
School in the morn­ing of the very day of that graduation <span style="">exercises, </span>imply­ing that he could not
have attached then a copy thereof (to show the decision of the committee of
teachers in the ranking of students <span style="">complained
of) to </span>his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stubborn
fact remains, however, that appellant had known of such decision of the said
committee <span style="">of </span>teachers much
earlier, as shown by the circumstance that accord­ing to him, even before the
filing of his petition with the lower court on the 19th of May, 1965, he had
person­ally appealed the said committee's decision with various higher
authorities of the above-named school, who merely passed the buck to each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, appellant men­tions in
his petition various other documents or papers as the Service Manual for
Teachers allegedly violated by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the
constitution of their committee; altered grading sheets; and erasures in his
Grade I certificate - which appellant never bothered to attach to his petition.
There could be no doubt then that he miserably failed to comply with the
requirement of Rule 65 above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With this <span style="">conclusion, </span>it
is no longer necessary to pass <span style="">upon </span>the
other two errors assigned by appellant.</p>
