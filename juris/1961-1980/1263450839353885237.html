of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Fifth
Branch, in a declaratory relief proceeding to test the validity of a Municipal
Ordinance of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
which as amended reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span> <u><span style="">City</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Tax</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> There shall be paid to
the City Treasurer on any and all productions of centrifugal sugar (B-Sugar)
locally sold or sold within the Philippines a city tax of Twenty Centavos
(P0.20) per <span class="SpellE">picul</span> and one <span class="SpellE">percentum</span>

by the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar <span style="">Company, Incorporated, </span>or by any other sugar mills [<span style="">sic</span>] in <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
City."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above amendatory ordinance was enacted on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1964</st1:date> and took effect
immediately after approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court sustained its validity in its decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal must fail and the decision of the lower court
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question before this Court
is one of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From and after <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1959</st1:date>, when the Local
Autonomy Act was enacted, the sphere of autonomy of a chartered city in the
enactment of taxing measures has been considerably enlarged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of the statute:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION <span style="">2.</span></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Taxation</span></u><span style="">.- </span>Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all
chartered cities, municipalities and municipal districts shall have authority
to impose municipal license <span style="">taxes or
fees upon persons engaged in any occupation or business, or exercising privileges
in chartered cities, municipalities or municipal districts by requiring them to
secure licenses at rates fixed by the municipal board or city council of the
city, the municipal council of the municipality, or the municipal district
council of the municipal district; to collect fees and charges for services
rendered by the city, municipality or municipal district; to regulate and
impose reasonable fees for <span style="">services </span>rendered
in connection with any business, profession or occupation being conducted within
the city, municipality or municipal district and otherwise to levy for public
purposes, just and uniform taxes, licenses or fees: <u>Provided</u>, That
municipalities and municipal districts shall, in no case impose any percentage
tax on sales or other <span style="">taxes </span>in
any form based thereon nor impose taxes on articles subject to specific tax,
except gasoline, under the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code: *

decided early this year, such broad taxing authority has been implemented and
vitalized by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last mentioned-case, Hodges v. Municipal Board, restated the
controlling doctrine in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"No special difficulty attends the resolution of the main
issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heretofore, we have announced the
doctrine that the grant of the power to tax to chartered cities under section 2
of the Local Autonomy Act is sufficiently plenary to cover '<u>everything</u>,
excepting those which are mentioned' therein, subject only to the limitation
that the tax so levied is for 'public purposes, just and uniform' (<span class="SpellE">Nin</span> Bay Mining Company v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, G. R
No. L-20125, <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1965</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing, and we do not believe it
is possible to show, that the tax levied, called by any name, -percentage tax
or sales tax - comes under any of the specific exceptions listed in section 2
of the Local Autonomy Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being
excepted, it must be regarded <span style="">as </span>coming within the purview of the general rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As the maxim goes, <u>'<span class="SpellE">Exceptio</span></u> <span class="SpellE"><u>firmat</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>regulam</u></span> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>casibus</u></span>
<u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>exceptis</u></span>'.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since its public purpose, justness and
uniformity of application are not <span class="GramE">disputed,</span> the tax so
levied must be sustained as valid."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above, it cannot be said that the ordinance
suffers from a constitutional or statutory infirmity as claimed in the first
alleged error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is
petitioner-appellant any more successful in its claim in the second assigned
error that the ordinance suffers from the taint of illegality, it being in
restraint of trade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of a
clear and specific showing that there was a transgression of a constitutional
provision or repugnancy to a controlling statute, an objection of such a
generalized character deserves but scant sympathy from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the indubitable policy expressly <span style="">set </span>forth in the Local Autonomy Act,
the invocation of such a talismanic formula as "restraint of trade"
without more no longer suffices, assuming it ever did, to nullify a taxing
ordinance, otherwise valid.</p>

affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without
