dated <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1964</st1:date>
ordering C.A. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> Shipping Co. and <span style="">C. A. </span><span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.”</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the late Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Madula</span>
was employed by C.A. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> Shipping Co. as Chief
Engineer since 1954 at a monthly salary of P420.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before he was employed he was physically
examined and was found to be physically fit <span style="">for the job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Chief Engineer
he had two assistants and three <span class="SpellE">oilers</span>; the
assistants worked under his supervision, while the <span class="SpellE">oilers</span>
were under his and his <span class="GramE">assistants</span> super­vision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While their vessel was sailing <span class="SpellE">Madula</span>,
as Chief En­gineer, generally stayed at the deck, while his assistants and <span class="SpellE">oilers</span> worked in the engine room - a place considerably
hotter than the other places aboard.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1957 <span class="SpellE">Madula</span> was physically examined
by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dolor­fino</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Chest Center and was found to be afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, he was only advised not
to perform heavy work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter he sub­mitted
himself to periodic medical treatment by the same physician, but in 1959 his
sickness became worse and on August 8 of that year he died leaving a widow and
nine children, all of them wholly dependent upon his monthly earnings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In due
time his dependents filed the corresponding claim for compensation, which the
employer <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue submitted below
was whether or not the pulmonary tuberculosis which caused <span class="SpellE">Madula's</span>
death on August 8, 1959 was directly caused by, or was, at least, aggravated by
the nature of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
evidence presented the Hearing Officer arrived at the conclusion that the
sickness that took <span class="SpellE">Madula</span> to his grave was neither
directly traceable to the nature of his work nor aggravated by it, and, as a
result, dismissed the claim as not being compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal the Commission en banc reversed
said decision, the Commission, upon con­sideration of the evidence, having
arrived at the conclusion that while the tuberculosis that caused the death of <span class="SpellE">Madula</span> was not caused exclusively by the nature of his work
or employment, the least that could be said is that the latter aggravated it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main reason in support of the Hearing Officer's <span style="">decision dismissing </span>the claim for
compensation was that <span style="">the deceased, </span>personally,
did not perform heavy work, end did not stay in the engine room except when the
vessel was <span style="">docking or leaving ports </span>of
call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following consi­derations of
the Commission, through Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span style="">Perez, </span>fully answer this argument:</p>

<blockquote>"However, we are of the opinion that the claimants' claim for
compensation should have been upheld on the theory of aggravation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that the varied duties of the
deceased as Chief Engineer did not require extraordinary physical effort, it
does not follow that his pulmonary tuberculosis could not <span style="">have been </span>aggrava­<span style="">ted </span>by <span style="">the </span>nature, conditions and incidents of his employment to the
extent of causing his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experience
shows that travel by boat may expose one to continuous jarring, <span class="GramE">specially</span> in a rough sea (certainly, from 1957 when the late
Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Madula</span> was first found <span style="">suffering </span>from pulmonary tuberculosis
to August <span style="">8, </span>1959, when he
succumbed to said illness, there must have been many such rough sea).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is true even for those who are
accustomed to see voyages as the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if we add the fact that a person afflicted with pulmonary
tuberculosis, more so in an <span class="SpellE">adversed</span> stage, must not
only have complete rest but should also refrain from performing the work
activities of even a normal individual, the only logical conclusion that may be
drawn from <span style="">the </span>f<span style="">a</span>cts end circumstances obtaining in the
case at bar is that the pulmonary tuberculosis <span style="">which </span>caused the death of Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Madula</span>
was aggravated by the nature, <span style="">conditions
</span>and incidents of his employment with the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact at the time death overtook
him on August 8, 1959, <span style="">he </span>was on
board the M/S ‘Eugene’ where he worked as Chief <span style="">Engineer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances that
</span>factors other <span style="">than his
employment might have also contributed to the aggravation of his pulmonary
tuberculo­sis is of no moment, because under the Workmen's Compensation Law,
the employment need not be the </span><span style="">only
cause of the acceleration of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">an illness </span><span style="">to entitle one </span><span style="">to
compensation; it </span>is <span style="">suffi­cient
if the employment contributed even in a small </span>way <span style="">to the worsening of </span><span style="">the disease which resulted in disability or
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(The <span style="">Law of Workmen's Compensation by Arthur Lar­</span>sen,
Vol.</span> </span>I, <span style="">p. 50).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, even assuring that there exists some doubt as to
the deceased pulmo­nary tuberculosis having been aggravated by his employment;
such doubt, for the purpose of carrying out the intents of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended, should be re­solved in favor of the
claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> Francisco, et al., v. Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Consing</span>, 63 Phil. 354; <span class="SpellE">Afable</span> v.
Loyola, G.R. No.</span> L-7789, May 27, 1955; <span class="SpellE">Enoria</span> vs.
Atlantic Gulf, 30 O.G., Sept. 15, 1951, as cited in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
Transportation Co. v. Josefina N. <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Ri­vera, et al., G.R. No. L-7658, May <span style="">8, </span>1956).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We, therefore, find that Joaquin Madula's pulmonary
tuberculosis which caused his death was aggravated by the nature, conditions
and incidents of his employment with the respondent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The errors <span style="">now attributed
to the </span>Commission <span style="">by </span>peti­tioners
are the following:</p>

<blockquote>“I. That the decision rendered by the respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission is not supported by evidence mounting to grave abuse of
discretion, hence void.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“II. That the findings of facts and conclusion
arrived et by the Hearing Offi­cer which has been set aside by respondent
Workmen's Compensation Commission is not in accordance with settled rules,
jurisprudence."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As may be readily seen, the questions posed by peti­tioners go to
the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence of record to justify the
decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined
that evidence and found it to be suffi­cient substantially to justify the
findings and conclu­sions of the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with
costs.</p>
