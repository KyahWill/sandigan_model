				<H3>FRANCISCA SERRANO DE AGBAYANI, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK AND
THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF PANGASINAN, DEFENDANTS,

PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A correct appreciation of the controlling doctrine as to the
effect, if any, to be attached to a statute subsequently adjudged invalid, is
decisive of this appeal from a lower court decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Francisca Serrano de <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, was able
to obtain a favorable judgment in her suit against defendant, now appellant
Philippine National Bank, permanently enjoining the other defendant, the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, from proceeding
with an extra-judicial foreclosure sale of land belonging to plaintiff
mortgaged to appellant Bank to secure a loan declared no longer enforceable,
the prescriptive period having lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was thus a failure to sustain the defense raised by appellant that
if the moratorium under an Executive Order and later an Act subsequently found
unconstitutional were to be counted in the computation, then the right to
foreclose the mortgage was still subsisting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In arriving at such a conclusion, the lower court manifested a tenacious
adherence to the inflexible view that an unconstitutional act is not a law,
creating no rights and imposing no duties, and thus as inoperative as if it had
never been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was oblivious to the
force of the principle adopted by this Court that while a statute's repugnancy
to the fundamental law deprives it of its character as a juridical norm, its
having been operative prior to its being nullified is a fact that is not devoid
of legal consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As will hereafter
be explained, such a failing of the lower court resulted in an erroneous decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find for appellant Philippine National
Bank, and we reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff obtained the loan in the amount of
P450.00 from defendant Bank dated <st1:date year="1939" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1939</st1:date>, maturing on <st1:date year="1944" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1944</st1:date>, secured by real estate mortgage duly registered covering
property described in T. C.T. No. 11275 of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1959</st1:date>, the balance due on said loan was in
the amount of P1,294.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as
July 13 of the same year, defendant instituted extra-judicial foreclosure
proceedings in the office of defendant Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> for the recovery of the balance of the loan
remaining unpaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff countered
with this suit against both defendants on <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1959</st1:date>, her main allegation being that the
mortgage sought to be foreclosed had long prescribed, fifteen years having
elapsed from the date of maturity, <st1:date year="1944" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1944</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She sought and was
able to obtain a writ of preliminary injunction against defendant Provincial
Sheriff, which was made permanent in the decision now on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Bank in its answer prayed for the
dismissal of the suit as even on plaintiff's own theory the defense of
prescription would not be available if the period from March 10, 1945, when
Executive Order No. 32<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
was issued, to July 26, 1948, when the subsequent legislative act<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
extending the period of moratorium was declared invalid, were to be deducted
from the computation of the time during which the bank took no legal steps for
the recovery of the loan. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As noted, the
lower court did not find such contention persuasive and decided the suit in
favor of plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal, which, as made clear at the outset, possesses
merit, there being a failure on the part of the lower court to adhere to the
applicable constitutional doctrine as to the effect to be given to a statute
subsequently declared invalid.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision now on appeal reflects the
orthodox view that an unconstitutional act, for that matter an executive order
or a municipal ordinance likewise suffering from that infirmity, cannot be the
source of any legal rights or duties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor can it justify any official act taken under it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its repugnancy to the fundamental law once
judicially declared results in its being to all intents and purposes a mere
scrap of paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the new Civil Code
puts it:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When the courts declare a
law to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the former shall be void and the
latter shall govern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Administrative or
executive acts, orders and regulations shall be valid only when they are not
contrary to the laws or the Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> It
is understandable why it should be so, the Constitution being supreme and
paramount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any legislative or executive
act contrary to its terms cannot survive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a view has support in logic and possesses the merit of
simplicity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not however be
sufficiently realistic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
admit of doubt that prior to the declaration of nullity such challenged legislative
or executive act must have been in force and had to be complied with. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This is so as until after the judiciary, in an
appropriate case, declares its invalidity, it is entitled to obedience and
respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parties may have acted under it
and may have changed their positions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What could be more fitting than that in a subsequent litigation regard
be had to what has been done while such legislative or executive act was in
operation and presumed to be valid in all respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now accepted as a doctrine that prior
to its being nullified, its existence as a fact must be reckoned with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is merely to reflect awareness that
precisely because the judiciary is the governmental organ which has the final
say on whether or not a legislative or executive measure is valid, a period of
time may have elapsed before it can exercise the power of judicial review that
may lead to a declaration of nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would be to deprive the law of its quality of fairness and justice then, if
there be no recognition of what had transpired prior to such adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the language of an American Supreme Court decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The actual existence of a statute,
prior to such a determination [of unconstitutionality], is an operative fact
and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The past cannot always be erased by a new
judicial declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect of the
subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various
aspects, — with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and
particular conduct, private and official."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This language has been quoted with approval in a resolution in <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> v. Hill<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and the decision in Manila Motor Co., Inc. v. Flores.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
An even more recent instance is the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>
speaking for the Court in Fernandez v. <span class="SpellE">Cuerva</span> and Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such an approach all the more commends itself
whenever police power legislation intended to promote public welfare but
adversely affecting property rights is involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While subject to be assailed on due process,
equal protection and non-impairment grounds, all that is required to avoid the corrosion
of invalidity is that the rational basis or reasonableness test is
satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislature on the whole
is not likely to allow an enactment suffering, to paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, from the infirmity of outrunning the bounds of
reason and resulting in sheer oppression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may be of course that if challenged, an adverse judgment could be the
result, as its running counter to the Constitution could still be shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meanwhile though, in the normal course
of things, it has been acted upon by the public and accepted as valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To ignore such a fact would indeed be the
fruitful parent of injustice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
as its constitutionality is conditioned on its being fair or reasonable, which
in turn is dependent on the actual situation, never static but subject to
change, a measure valid when enacted may subsequently, due to altered
circumstances, be stricken down.</p>

<p class="BODY">That is precisely what happened in connection with Republic Act
No. 342, the moratorium legislation, which continued Executive Order No. 32, issued
by the then President <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, suspending the
enforcement of payment of all debts and other monetary obligations payable by
war sufferers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was explicitly held
in <span class="SpellE">Rutter</span> v. Esteban<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
where such enactment was considered in 1953 "unreasonable and oppressive,
and should not be prolonged a minute longer, and, therefore, the same should be
declared null and void and without effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
At the time of the issuance of the above Executive Order in 1945 and of the
passage of such Act in 1948, there was a factual justification for the
moratorium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was confronted with an emergency of impressive magnitude at the time of her
liberation from the Japanese military forces in 1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Business was at a standstill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her economy lay prostrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Measures, radical measures, were then devised
to tide her over until some semblance of normalcy could be restored and an
improvement in her economy noted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
wonder then that the suspension of enforcement of payment of the obligations
then existing was declared first by executive order and then by
legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court was right
therefore in rejecting the contention that on its face, the Moratorium Law was
unconstitutional, amounting as it did to the impairment of the obligation of
contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the circumstances
confronting the legitimate government upon its return to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
some such remedial device was needed and badly so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An unyielding insistence then on the right to
property on the part of the creditors was not likely to meet with judicial
sympathy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time passed however, and
conditions did change.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the legislation was before this Court in 1953, the question
before it was its satisfying the rational basis test, not as of the time of its
enactment but as of such date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, if
then it were found unreasonable, the right to non-impairment of contractual
obligations must prevail over the assertion of community power to remedy an
existing evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court was
convinced that such indeed was the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stated in the opinion of Justice Bautista Angelo:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"But we should not lose sight of the
fact that these obligations had been pending since 1945 as a result of the
issuance of Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32 and at present their enforcement is
still inhibited because of the enactment of Republic Act No. 342 and would
continue to be unenforceable during the eight-year period granted to prewar
debtors to afford them an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, which in
plain language means that the creditors would have to observe a vigil of at
least twelve (12) years before they could affect a liquidation of their
investment dating as far back as 1941.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This period seems to us unreasonable, if not oppressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the purpose of Congress is plausible,
and should be commended, the relief accorded works injustice to creditors who
are practically left at the mercy of the debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their hope to effect collection becomes
extremely remote, more so if the credits are unsecured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the injustice is more patent when, under
the law, the debtor is not even required to pay interest during the operation
of the relief, unlike similar statutes in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The conclusion to which the foregoing considerations inevitably led was that as
of the time of adjudication, it was apparent that Republic Act No. 342 could
not survive the test of validity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Executive Order No. 32 should likewise be nullified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That before the decision they were not
constitutionally infirm was admitted expressly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is all the more reason then to yield assent to the now prevailing
principle that the existence of a statute or executive order prior to its being
adjudged void is an<i> </i>operative fact to which legal consequences are
attached.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Precisely though because of the judicial
recognition that moratorium was a valid governmental response to the plight of
the debtors who were war sufferers, this Court has made clear its view in a
series of cases impressive in their number and unanimity that during the
eight-year period that Executive Order No. 32 and Republic Act No. 342 were in
force, prescription did not run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it
has been held from Day v. Court of First Instance,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

handed down only last year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
deplorable is that as of the time of the lower court decision on <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1960</st1:date>, at least eight
decisions had left no doubt as to the prescriptive period being tolled in the
meanwhile prior to such adjudication of invalidity.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Speaking of the opposite view entertained by the lower court, the present Chief
Justice, in <span class="SpellE">Liboro</span> v. Finance and Mining Investments
Corp.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

Executive Order No. 32 remains in full force and effect for the war sufferers

obligations payable by private parties within the Philippines originally
incurred or contracted before December 8, 1941, and still remaining unpaid, any
provision or provisions in the contract creating the same or in any subsequent
