				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case was originally certified to this Court in 1972<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for automatic review of the decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao del Norte promulgated in open court on September 22, 1972 finding Gomez Saligan guilty of the special complex crime of "rape with homicide" as indicted, and sentencing him to death.<br><br>In a decision promulgated on November 29, 1972<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> penned by then Associate Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, this Court found and held that "the trial Court, far from approximating the model of conduct We outlined in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Apduhan</span> (L-19491, August 30, 1968, 24 SCRA 798), proceeded with inordinate haste in the arraignment of the defendant and disregarded this Court's injunction regarding the observance of solicitous care in the ad­mission of pleas of guilty to capital offenses," citing a long string of cases from <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. vs. Talbanos</span>, 6 Phil. 641, to <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Villafuerte</span>, L-32026, July 31, 1973.&nbsp; The judgment appealed from was, therefore, set aside and the case remanded to the court of origin for a new arraignment and further proceedings in accordance with law and consistently with the views expressed by this Court.<br><br>Accused Saligan was arraigned anew in the Court below on March 11, 1974 with the assistance of counsel.&nbsp; He entered a plea of "not guilty".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The case proceeded to trial, and on September 24, 1974, the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which reads in part as follows:<br><blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court finds Gomez Saligan guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of the crime of Attempted Rape with Homicide as defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, for which he is hereby sentenced to death by electrocution, to indemnify the heirs of his victim, Teofista Maloloy-on, in the amount of P12,000.00, to suffer all the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay the costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Hence this automatic review of the death penalty imposed.<br><br>The record reveals the following undisputed facts:<br><br>At around 11:00 o'clock in the morning of July 2, 1972, a certain Rufino Rocacorba was buried at Mawab, Davao del Norte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Among those who attended the burial were Teofista Maloloy-on, Anastacia Rocacorba and herein appellant Gomez Saligan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> After the burial, Teofista, Anastacia and Saligan boarded a jeep and the women disembarked at the house of the deceased Rufino Rocacorba at Sitio San Isidro, Maco, Davao del Norte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> At around 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon of that same day, Teofista left ahead of Anastacia, informing the latter that she had to go home to attend to her child and that she had a previous agreement with appellant Saligan to meet at "Cable," a hanging bridge on the way to Limbo, Maco, Davao del Norte, so that they could go home together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The next day, July 3, 1972, the dead body of Teofista was discovered at a spot around fifty (50) meters from the hanging bridge, near the river.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Dr. Antonio C. Sebumpan, Municipal Health Physician of Maco, Davao del Norte, conducted the autopsy on the corpse at about 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; His Necropsy Report contains the following medical findings:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"<span style="font-style: italic;">NECROPSY REPORT</span><br></div><br>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:<br><br>This is to certify that the undersigned had personally conducted a postmortem examination on Mrs. Teofista Maloloy-on, 31 years old, married with eight children and residing at barrio Limbo, Maco, Davao del Norte, on July 3, 1972 at 1:00 P.M. at barrio Panibasan, Maco, Davao del Norte.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">MEDICAL FINDINGS </div><ol type="I"> <li>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: <br><br><ol> <li>Position of the corpse - Body lying with her back at the open field about eight (8) meters away from the barrio road.&nbsp; Both thighs spread apart, both legs flexed over the thigh.&nbsp; Abdomen downward bared.&nbsp; Location of the underwear panty at left ankle, panty smeared with blood.&nbsp; Body smeared with blood.<br><br></li><li>Fairly developed, fairly nourished, with absence of vital function during examination as heart rate, respiratory rate and pulse rate and weighing about 100 lbs.<br><br></li><li>Head - Left cheek contusion about 4 cm. in dia., right cheek contusion 3 cm. in diameter, forehead contusion about 3 cm. in diameter.<br><br></li><li>Neck - Anterior aspect (Throat) - Incised wound (Hacking wound), 6 cm. in length, 2 cm. above the suprasternal notch.&nbsp; Major blood vessels, muscles, esophagus cut.<br><br></li><li>Chest - Anterior aspect - left clavicular area-stab wound 4 inches in depth.&nbsp; Entrance of the wound 2 cm. in diameter.<br><br></li><li>Abdomen - Epigastric area-stab wound.&nbsp; Point of entrance 2 cm. in diameter.&nbsp; Point of exit 1 cm. in diameter at the back.<br><br></li><li>Right hand - Dorsal aspect-Incised deep wound 5 cm. in length.<br><br></li><li>Left hand - Incised deep wound between left thumb and left index finger, 4 cm. in length.<br><br></li><li>Left Arm - Upper third anterior aspect-incised deep wound, 5 cm. in length.<br><br></li><li>Right Thigh - Anterior aspect - upper third-stab wound 3 inches depth, 2 cm. in diameter entrance.&nbsp; Presence of contusion 5 cm. in diameter middle aspect.<br><br></li><li>Left Thigh - Anterior aspect - middle third-contusion 5 cm. in diameter. <br><br></li></ol> </li><li>GENITAL EXAMINATION: <br><br><ol> <li>&nbsp;Genitalia - absence of underwear panty.&nbsp; Panty located at the left ankle smeared with blood.&nbsp; Pubic hair sparse - absence of blood, semen and foreign body.<br><br></li><li>Vulva -<br><br>a) Labia Majora - nothing pertinent.<br>b) Labia Minora - nothing pertinent.<br><br></li><li>Vaginal opening gaping.

ANTONIO C. SEBUMPAN, M.D.<br>Municipal Health Physician<br>Maco, Davao del Norte"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></div></li></ol></blockquote>It further appears from the evidence for the prosecution that on July 4, 1972, or two days after the alleged incident, appellant Saligan executed an Affidavit marked in evidence as Exhibit "A",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> confessing to the rape and killing of Teofista Maloloy-on.&nbsp; Patrolman Arnulfo P. Gohol, the police investigator who conducted the investigation, testified that the contents of Exhibit "A", which is in English, were translated word for word to the accused in the Visayan-Cebuano dialect which the latter spoke fluently and understood although he is a Mansaca.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Pat. Gohol further stated that the accused was arrested because his hat was found near the body of the victim Teofista,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and in the course of the investigation that followed his arrest, the accused said that he did not need the services of a lawyer because he was "going to answer his guilt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Municipal Judge Feliciano L. Belleza before whom the Affidavit, Exhibit "A", appears to have been subscribed and sworn to by the accused on July 4, 1972, also testified for the prosecution.&nbsp; He declared, among others, that he conversed with the accused in Visayan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that he translated every word of Exhibit "A" to the accused in the Visayan dialect,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that the latter told him (Judge Belleza) that he voluntarily surrendered to the police because he was afraid of the "<span style="font-style: italic;">barrio</span> folks and the relatives" of the deceased Teofista,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and that the accused, when asked whether the Affidavit was given by him voluntarily to the police department of Maco, replied in the affirmative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In this appeal, accused Gomez Saligan, through his counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>, does not question the ruling of the trial Court on the homicide aspect of this case.&nbsp; On the contrary, he admits to having killed the victim with his own bolo, hacking and stabbing her several times and inflicting injuries which caused her death.&nbsp; Indeed, the evidence is overwhelming on this point.&nbsp; As stated earlier, Teofista informed Anastacia Rocacorba that she was going to meet the accused at the "Cable" bridge.&nbsp; The victim's lifeless body was found near the same bridge.&nbsp; The accused's buri hat, which he himself acknowledged as belonging to him, was found beside the dead body of Teofista.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The accused likewise identified the bolo, marked in evidence as Exhibit "D", and stained with blood when recovered by the police authorities, as his own.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The doctor who performed the autopsy testified that the wounds on the victim's body could have been inflicted with this same bolo, Exhibit "D".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> And the strongest evidence of all is the accused's own admission, by way of Affidavit of Confession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and in the Court at the trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> that he killed Teofista Maloloy-on.&nbsp; Finally, in his Brief, appellant declares that "there is no question that the homicide had been committed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> praying that the decision of the lower Court be modified by convicting him of simple homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> We, therefore, deem it unnecessary to further delve on the matter of the homicide except in relation to the other remaining issues.<br><br>It is the rape aspect of this case that is in dispute.&nbsp; The trial Court found that there was attempted rape.&nbsp; Appellant vigorously insists that he never raped or attempted to rape the victim at any time before or after her death.&nbsp; The Solicitor General, for the government, maintains that the rape was consummated.&nbsp; Before proceeding any further, however, it must be stated that regardless of whether herein appellant is found guilty of consummated rape or a mere attempt thereof, the penalty imposable on him will be the same.&nbsp; The Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Acts Nos. 2632 and 4111, expressly provides in its Article 335 that "(w)hen rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be likewise death.&nbsp; When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death."<br><br>Appellant contends that on the issue of the alleged attempted rape, the testimony of Dr. Antonio C. Sebumpan as the only witness presented by the prosecution is highly inconclusive and insufficient, that the other witnesses testifying are totally unavailing, and that there was an invalid reliance on the weakness of the evidence for the defense.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Solicitor General in his Brief counters that consummated rape had been sufficiently proven not only by the testimony of Dr. Sebumpan but likewise by the appellant's own affidavit of confession, Exhibit "A", the testimonies of Patrolman-Investigator Arnulfo P. Gohol and Municipal Judge Feliciano L. Belleza, and the fact that the contents of Exhibit "A" are corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Sebumpan.<br><br>After going over the entire record of this case, We have reached the conclusion and are fully convinced, as the Solicitor General maintains, that there was consummated rape.<br><br>In the lower Court, appellant repudiated his extrajudicial confession, Exhibit "A", on the sole ground that the contents thereof were not explained to him.&nbsp; The Court <u>a quo</u> in arriving at its decision disregarded Exhibit "A" reasoning thus:<br><blockquote>"(t)he accused, on the stand, said his Affidavit, which is in English, was not translated to him.&nbsp; The accused is a Mansaca who speaks his native dialect and Cebu-Visayan only.&nbsp; He speaks no English at all.&nbsp; He is illiterate, - he only knows how to write his first name 'Gomez'."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>We rule otherwise.&nbsp; As We had stated in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Dorado</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and reiterated in the recently decided case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Abejero</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> "it is not sound practice for the court to disregard the confession just because the accused repudiates it at the trial, (hence) before setting aside a confession, the reasons and motives for its repudiation should be carefully scrutinized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In the instant case, We find that appellant's extrajudicial confession is admissible as evidence to prove his culpability and, therefore, must be given due weight and consideration.&nbsp; Our reasons are stated hereunder.<br><br>First, appellant expressly acknowledged his signature on Exhibit "A".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He does not allege that the sworn declaration was extracted from him through force and intimidation or that he was compelled by duress to affix his signature thereon.&nbsp; Appellant merely claimed during the trial that the contents of Exhibit "A" were not explained to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As a general rule, We look with disfavor upon extrajudicial confessions couched in a language or dialect admittedly not known or understood by the supposed declarant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> However, We may make an exception when there is sufficient and satisfactory proof to show that the contents of the confession had been translated and explained to the alleged declarant and he understood the same, and the confession on its face bears the earmarks of voluntariness.&nbsp; Thus, in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Dayday, et al.</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> We upheld the admissibility of the extrajudicial confessions holding thus:<br><blockquote>"The accused, therefore, may not convincingly deny knowledge of the contents of their written confessions, for the same were translated and explained to them by the municipal mayor in the Binukid dialect, which dialect they habitually spoke.&nbsp; As stated, they affirmed the contents of their confes­sions before the municipal mayor and, later, before the justice of the peace."</blockquote>In the instant case, both the police officer who took down the confession and the municipal judge before whom the same confession was subscribed and sworn to testi­fied in Court and categorically declared under oath that although the appellant is a Mansaca, they learned through conversing with him that he knew; understood and spoke fluently the Visayan-Cebuano dialect, and that they translated the contents of the typewritten confession word for word to appellant in the said dialect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> At the trial, appellant admitted that he knew, understood and spoke Visayan-Cebuano, and in fact he gave his testimony in Court in that dialect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the second place, appellant affirmed the veracity of most of the statements contained in his Affidavit.&nbsp; The following transpired in the direct examination of appellant:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">"Q</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Now, I will read to you certain parts of this affidavit, Exhibit "A": 'Q.

Sebumpan in respect of the position and location of the corpse at the time of its discovery, the number and nature of the wounds on the victim's body, the kind of weapon used to inflict the wounds, the absence of the victim's underwear at her genitalia and the cause of her death.<br><br>Thirdly, the investigating officer who took down appellant's confession and the administering officer before whom said confession was subscribed and sworn to are entitled to the presumption of regularity, short of any convincing evidence to the contrary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> more so in view of the absence of an imputation or any fact or circumstance disclosed by the record that they had a motive or valid reason to accuse appellant falsely of so grave an offense as rape with homicide.&nbsp; On top of this, We do not see how either of them could have supplied the precise details found in the affidavit of confession, facts which only appellant could have known, and most of which he, in fact, confirmed.<br><br>Lastly, the presumption of the law is in favor of the spontaneity and voluntariness of an extrajudicial confession of an accused in a criminal case.&nbsp; The burden is upon the declarant to destroy this presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Appellant has failed in this task.<br><br>We, therefore, find no justification for the exclusion of Exhibit "A" from the mass of evidence to be considered, weighed and evaluated in determining the existence and extent of appellant's guilt.<br><br>We do not agree with the trial court that the accused merely attempted to rape Teofista.&nbsp; Besides the categorical statement in appellant's extrajudicial confession that "But before leaving her seriously wounded, I was able to abuse her two times," there is clear and convincing evidence on record proving that rape had been consummated by the accused when he admitted that he took out his penis and inserted it in the vagina of the victim (See underlined portion of the Affidavit of accused, Exhibit "A").&nbsp; The law, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, provides that "(r)ape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman," and jurisprudence requires that there must be proof to some degree of entrance or penetration of the male organ into the labia or lips of the offended party's vagina for rape to be considered to have reached the consummated stage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Although the victim was a married woman who had borne eight children,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and the autopsy revealed no vaginal bleeding or laceration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and no semen was recovered at the time of the post-mortem examination,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We concur with Dr. Sebumpan's opinion that sexual intercourse had been committed, based on his findings that (1) the dead body was in a coital position, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, it was lying with back on the ground, the two legs flexed over the thighs, and the two thighs flexed over the abdomen and spread apart; (2) the panty of the victim was not in the genitalia but in her left ankle; and (3) the vagina was gaping,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which circumstances were not contradicted by the defense.&nbsp; On the contrary, the appellant's admission that he inserted his penis into the vagina of the victim must be accepted as true from the factual and physical circumstances above stated.<br><br>Appellant does not dispute the findings of Dr. Sebumpan as embodied in the Necropsy Report, Exhibit "B-1".&nbsp; The post-mortem examination disclosed that the victim sustained, among other injuries, contusions in her right and left cheeks, and right and left thighs, middle anterior aspect.&nbsp; Contusions are produced by the application of force,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> such as boxing.&nbsp; This evidence indicates that Teofista had put up a struggle so that appellant had to box her on the cheeks and thighs to restrain her.&nbsp; That Teofista's panty was found at her left ankle is a further indication that appellant used force to have sexual intercourse with the victim, for if it were true, as appellant would have the Court believe, that it was Teofista who voluntarily removed her underwear, why would she leave it hanging from her ankle?&nbsp; In other words, the location of the panty at the time of the autopsy strongly suggests that Teofista had been forcibly stripped of her underwear.&nbsp; Finally, the fact that the corpse was found in a coital position strengthens Our conclusion that appellant had the opportunity and took advantage of it to abuse sexually his victim.<br><br>Apart from the foregoing, the evidence for the defense is weak.&nbsp; Only appellant testified in his behalf, and his credibility is greatly impaired by inconsistencies, contradictions and improbabilities in his testimony.&nbsp; For instance, he would make it appear that it was Teofista who made overtures at sex, claiming that she put her arm on his shoulder then later took off her underwear,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and that he took advantage because he was alone with her and it was dark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Yet, he categorically declared that he had no amorous relations whatsoever with the victim, he never courted her, and they had never made love or talked about it at any time before or even immediately prior to the incident in question,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and, as a matter of fact, they were not even close friends, merely neighbors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Under these circumstances, We cannot bring Ourselves to believe that a Filipino married woman with eight children like Teofista would do what appellant claims she did unless she had some kind of a sexual or mental aberration.&nbsp;

Likewise in support of his submission, appellant invites attention to Dr. Sebumpan's testimony that "the wounds were inflicted before the sexual intercourse,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and to the allegation in the Information filed against him in this case that the injuries inflicted upon Teofista caused her "instantaneous death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The above argument is devoid of merit and We quote with approval from the Solicitor General's Brief, thus:<br><blockquote>"The argument that the rape was on a dead woman is hairsplitting.&nbsp; When the appellant started to force the woman to submit to his carnal desires, she was alive and fighting for her honor.&nbsp; But even assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> this hairsplitting distinction, there is no evidence that the woman was already medically dead when he raped her.&nbsp; Instead of desisting and calling for help in an attempt to save her life, he x x x went ahead with the rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote>As for appellant's testimony on the matter, We have previously shown that it is unworthy of credence, hence the same may be disregarded.&nbsp; With respect to Dr. Sebumpan's statement alluded to, the record shows that he was referring only to the stab wounds on the victim's body.&nbsp; It must be remembered that according to this witness' Necropsy Report, aside from stab wounds on the chest, abdomen and right thigh, Teofista sustained contusions on both cheeks, on the forehead and on both thighs, one incised wound at the neck, and incised deep wounds on both hands and on the left arm.&nbsp; Nowhere in Dr. Sebumpan's testimony does he claim that the stab wounds, which according to him "were inflicted before the sexual intercourse" caused the victim to die instantaneously.&nbsp; It is entirely probable, and indeed Dr. Sebumpan's testimony does not rule out the possibility, that some of the wounds, particularly the stab wounds, were inflicted <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> and even <span style="font-style: italic;">during</span> the sexual intercourse to subdue the victim, and the others <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> carnal knowledge to kill her and seal her lips forever.&nbsp; As to the allegation of "instantaneous death" in the Information, the same is not material.&nbsp; The word "instantaneous" was manifestly used merely to qualify the term "death", and was not at all meant to determine the crime committed or the severity of the penalty to be imposed.&nbsp; More than that, it is obvious from the text of the charge that the injuries alleged as having caused "instantaneous death" refer to injuries inflicted after the rape.<br><br>In resume, We find that the appellant's culpability for the complex crime of rape with homicide has been fully and conclusively established by the evidence on record.&nbsp; The sentence of death imposed by the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> must be affirmed.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the judgment appealed from is hereby modified in that We find the accused guilty of rape with homicide and he is hereby sentenced to the supreme penalty of DEATH.&nbsp;
