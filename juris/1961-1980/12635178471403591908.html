<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1965</st1:date>
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
rendered its decision in Civil Case No. H-4834, granting the petition of herein
respondent <span class="SpellE">Igmedio</span> Yap for naturalization as a
Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Fiscal
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental received <span style="">a </span>copy of the decision on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>; the Solicitor General received a copy on
the following April 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon instruction
of the Solicitor General the Provincial Fiscal, thru his assistant, filed with
the trial court a notice of appeal and the corresponding record on appeal on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1965</st1:date>, the trial judge disapproved the
same on the ground that the decision had become final, copy thereof having been
received by the Provincial Fiscal on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial
Fiscal moved to reconsider but was turned down in another order of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the Government filed the instant
petition, praying among other things:</p>

<blockquote>“(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That after hearing,
judgment be rendered to declare both Orders of respondent judge dated September
1 and October 27, 1965 as illegal, null and void, as it was issued in excess of
its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To order respondent
judge Honorable Carlos <span class="SpellE">Abiera</span> who is presiding Branch
VI of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Himamaylan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, to approve the "Record on
Appeal" (Annex "B" hereof);"<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The only question here is whether the thirty-day period to appeal
should be counted from notice of the decision to the Provincial Fiscal or to
the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question,
and the arguments of herein respondents in support of their position, have
already been resolved by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus in the case of Republic vs. Chiu, G. R. No. L-20846, <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="10">Oct. 31, 1964</st1:date>, 12 SCRA 352,
involving the same factual background as that of this case, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that the appearance of the City Attorney
for the government, in the hearing, was authorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This authorization, however, in the light of
the foregoing provision of law,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
cannot be construed to have divested the Solicitor General of his control of
the stand or defense of the State, nor did it make of the City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> the counsel of record for the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">oppositor</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phi­lippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that the law prescribes that the
Solicitor General shall appear on behalf of the government "either himself
or through his delegate or the <span style="">provincial
fiscal concerned." </span>It did not say, "the Solicitor General or
the provincial fiscal" can appear on behalf of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in order to make of the latter an alter­nate of the state counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As thus worded, what the law allows is merely
the physical substitution of the Solicitor General in such proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, notwithstanding the delegation
to the City Attorney of the duty to appear at and attend the hearing in this
case, the Solicitor General remained the counsel of record for the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
not a case where a party litigant is represented by two lawyers, notice to one
of whom is notice to the client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here,
the City Attorney did not appear as counsel for the <span style="">Republic, </span>but merely as representative of the Solicitor General
who, as stated, remained the counsel of record for the Republic. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"As the Solicitor General received copy of the decision of the
lower court on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1962</st1:date>,
the period to appeal would have expired on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1962</st1:date>. The filing of the notice of appeal and
record on appeal on September 4 and 6, 1962, respectively, were therefore made
on time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The remedy of <i>mandamus</i> pursued by the Solicitor General is
proper, the relief prayed for being to order respondent Judge to give due
course to the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ is granted; the orders of respondent
Court dated September 1 and <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="10">October
 27, 1965</st1:date> are hereby set aside; and the said Court is directed to
approve the record on appeal and certify the same to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

SEC. 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Hearing of the Petition</span></u><span style="">.-
</span>No petition shall be heard within the thirty <span style="">days preceding any election. The hear­ing shall be public, and the
