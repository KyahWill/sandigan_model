The law listens and yields obedience, unless in the preparation thereof or in
the disposition made therein there is a failure to follow a legal norm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present suit, there was none as to the
formalities required, the will in question having been probated on <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to its intrinsic validity, there ap­parently
was none either as shown by the project of partition having been approved by
the lower court, again, without oppo­sition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As more specifically set forth in the decision of the Court of
Appeals of January 18, 1967, the reconsideration of which after about a year,
to be more precise, on January 8, 1968, led to this petition for
certiorari:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It appears from the
record that <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Margarita Rodriguez died in the City
of Manila on July 19, 1960, leaving a last will and testament under date of
September 30, 1951 and that said last will and testament was legalized by
virtue of the resolution or order of the Court of First Instance of Manila,
under date of September 23, 1960, without the appellant's opposition in Special
Proceeding No. 3845, hence the extrinsic validity of the will was substantially
not in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1962</st1:date>, the executor of the last will
and testament of the late <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Margarita Rodriguez
pre­sented a project of partition and the same was approved by the Court of
First Instance of Manila, again without the opposition of the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the intrinsic validity of the will
could never be again questioned and raised as issue in the trusteeship
proceedings No. 51872 of the same court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One would expect, therefore, that the aforesaid decision of the
Court of Appeals would write finis to this litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, it was not so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ought not to have been the case, for, as
admitted, the deceased, to quote from the language of the January 18, 1967
decision of the Court of Appeals, "at the time of her death left no
compulsory heirs or forced heirs and, consequently, [was] free to dispose of
her properties even to strangers at will as provided in her will."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It was likewise noted therein that the testatrix created a trust which was
objected to by private respondents, who claimed to be first cousins of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an objection was
overruled by the lower court which granted letters of trusteeship to
petitioners, who were the executors under the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an order of the lower court was appealed
by respondent to the Court of Appeals, which, in the original decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date>, affirmed the action
taken by the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration filed by private respondents
resulted in a resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January 8,
 1968</st1:date>, which set aside its previous decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date> and modified the judgment
appealed from insofar as the validity of the provision of clause 10 of the will
creating the trusteeship was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">In the resolution setting aside the original decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date>, the Court of
Appeals held that the above "perpetual prohibition to alienate" the
property mentioned, constitutes a clear violation of Article 867 and Article
870 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further
stated in the aforesaid reso­lution that the Court of Appeals did arrive
"at the considered view that the trust in question is a nullity for being
in violation of the afore stated rules (against perpetuities and the limitation
regarding the inalienability of the hereditary estate)."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There being then no institution of heirs as regards the properties covered by
the trust, the Court of Appeals held that "there should be intestate
succession concerning the same, with the nearest relative of the deceased
entitled to inherit the properties in accordance with the law on
intestacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case should, therefore,
be remanded to the lower court."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence this petition for certiorari to review tie aforesaid resolution of the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the above clause was not passed upon in the
decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date>
of the Court of Appeals; rather, it was assumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view that then prevailed was that the
approval of the project of partition sufficed to dispose of that question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The challenged resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1968</st1:date> betrayed a change of
heart of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
explained why:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The contention of
[petitioner] that there had already been a project of partition approved by the
lower court [which] operates as a waiver on the part of the [respondents] to
raise the issue of the invalidity of the questioned provision of the will which
We have sustained in our decision, seems to be not well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have discovered from the records that the
properties involved in this case have not been disposed of as yet and are still
within the reach of the probate court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The necessary procedure, there­fore, in accordance with the law as
delineated in the above discussion, should be observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the lower court granting the
petition for the formation of the trust in question should be annulled as being
in violation of the rules against perpetuities and the limitation on the
prohibition for the alien­ation of the property left by the deceased."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We will not deviate from the approach thus taken by the Court of
Appeals in the challenged resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1968</st1:date>, but we differ in our conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the clause, at least insofar as the
first twenty-year period is concerned, in accordance with the Civil Code
provision.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, we find for petitioners and reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the clause in question if interpreted to conform
to the controlling legal norm prescribed by the Civil Code cannot be
assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1967</st1:date> decision of the Court of Appeals
were to be modified, it is only in the above sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reconsideration, as was done in the
challenged resolution, which would have the effect of partial intestacy, was
uncalled for.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not admit of doubt that in the disputed clause the
testatrix did make clear her purpose not to mortgage or to sell forevermore (<span class="SpellE"><u>kailan</u></span> <u>man</u>) certain properties left by
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would seem then some
justification for the Court of Appeals in the challenged resolution to deny
force and effect to such a wish considering that "a perpetual prohibition
to alienate" is by the Civil Code forbidden.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The more controlling provision, however, as already made mention of is supplied
by Article 870.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its terms are
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The dispositions of the
testator declaring all or part of the estate inalienable for more than twenty
years are void."</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision does not need any
interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It speaks
categorically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is declared void is
the testamentary disposition prohibiting alienation after the twenty-year
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interim, such a provision
does not suffer from the vice of invalidity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be stricken down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time
and time again, we have said, and we now repeat, that when a legal provision is
clear and to the point, there is no room for interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be applied according to its literal
terms.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even with the purpose that the testatrix had in mind were not as
unequivocal, still the same conclusion emerges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no room for intestacy as would be the effect if the challenged
resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1968</st1:date>
were not set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wishes of the
testatrix constitute the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her will
must be given effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so even if
there could be an element of uncertainty insofar as the ascertainment thereof
is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of a Civil
Code provision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If a testamentary
disposition admits of different interpretations, in case of doubt, that
interpretation by which the disposition is to be operative shall be
preferred."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor is this all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A later article of the
Civil Code equally calls for observance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The words of a will
are to receive an interpretation which will give to every expression some
effect, rather than one which will render any of the expressions in­operative;
and of two modes of interpreting a will, that is to be preferred which will
prevent intestacy."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The net result would be to reaffirm the conclusion reached that
the challenged resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1">January 8,
 1968</st1:date> is objectionable, in view of its lack of fidelity to the
controlling legal norms.</p>

<p class="BODY">In no other way can there be deference paid to what the testator
had in mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court so emphatically
expressed it in a decision rendered more than sixty years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Respect for the will of a testator as expressed in his last
testamentary disposition, constitutes the principal basis of the rules which
the law prescribes for the correct interpretation of all of the clauses of the
will; the words and provisions therein written must be plainly construed in
order to avoid a violation of his intentions and real purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The will of the testator clearly and
explicitly stated must be respected and complied with as an inviolable law
among the parties in interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is
the doctrine established by the supreme court of Spain, constantly maintained
in a great number of decisions, among which are those of March 24, 1863, April
28, 1882, and December 16, 1903."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, so compelling is the principle that intestacy should be
avoided and the wishes of the testator allowed to prevail that we could even
vary the language of the will for the purpose of giving it effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Where the testator's intention is
manifest from the context of the will and surrounding circumstances, but is
obscured by inapt and inaccurate modes of expression, the language will be
subordinated to the intention, and in order to give effect to such intention,
as far as possible, the court may depart from the strict wording and read a
word or phrase in a sense different from that which is ordinarily attributed to
it, and for such purpose may mould or change the language of the will, such as
restricting its application or supply­ing omitted words or phrases."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A more recent reiteration of such an attitude is found in an
opinion by former Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "As a closing observation, it is
not for us to discover the motives of <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> <span class="SpellE">Villapaña</span> in leaving her properties to the person named in
the will, and omitting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the <span class="SpellE">oppositors-appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to state that the trial court itself found the will to have
been executed free from falsification, fraud, trickery or undue influence, with
<span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> having testamentary capacity; and in such a
situation it becomes our duty to give expression to her will."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What further fortifies the view taken by us is the admitted fact,
as was expressed in the <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="1">January 13,
 1967</st1:date> decision of the Court of Appeals that at the time of her death
the deceased "left no compulsory heirs or forced heirs and, consequently,
free to dispose of her properties even to strangers * * * as provided in her
will."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
That is what she did and petitioners have no valid cause for complaint, at
least not one cognizable in a court of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we had occasion to state: "Though it might appear right
that <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> should
receive something from the estate because he, together with Arisen <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>, has been raised by the testatrix, and both are
her relatives, nevertheless it would be venturesome for us to advance our own
idea of a just distribution of the property in the face of a different mode of
disposition so clearly expressed by the testatrix in the later will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she had no forcible heirs, she was
absolutely free to give her estate to whomsoever she chose, subject of course
to the payment of her debts. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It would be
a dangerous precedent to strain the interpretation of a will in order to effect
what the court believes to be an equitable division of the estate of a deceased
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only function of the courts
in these cases is to carry out the intention of the deceased as manifested in
the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once that intention has been
determined through a careful reading of the will or wills, and provided the law
on <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> has not been violated, it is beyond the
pale of judicial cognizance to inquire into the fairness or unfairness of any
devise or bequest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might be said that
it is hard to understand how, in a temporary anger at <span class="SpellE">Amando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, the testatrix would entirely cut him off
from the inheritance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not, however, sit in judgment upon her
motives and sentiments, first because, as already stated, nothing in the law
restrained her from disposing of her property in any manner she desired, and
secondly, be­cause there are no adequate means of ascertaining the inward
processes of her conscience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was the
sole judge of her own attitude toward those who expected her bounty."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing can be clearer, therefore, than that petitioners could
not challenge the provision in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had no right to vindicate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a right may never arise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
twenty-year period is still with us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What would transpire thereafter is still locked up in the inscrutable
future, beyond the power of mere mortals to foretell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, we cannot anticipate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor should we.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not possess the power either of conferring
a cause of action to a party when, under the circumstances dis­closed, it had
none.</p>
