Ping Lay to be <span class="GramE">Admitted</span> a Citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Petitioner Ting Ping Lay obtained a favorable
decision in the afore-mentioned case on September 29, 1971, but after the lapse
of the two-year period required by law before the judgment could be executed
and registered and petitioner could take his oath, respondent Judge issued an
adverse Order dated April 22, 1974, denying the petition and setting aside the
Decision of September 29, 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the foregoing Order was denied
and petitioner sought to appeal the Order of denial to this Court, filing for
the purpose a Notice of Appeal, a Record on Appeal and an Appeal Bond, but said
appeal was dismissed by respondent Judge, per Order dated August 16, 1974, on
the ground that the same had not been perfected on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A "Motion for Reconsideration and/or
Petition for Relief from Order of <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="8">August
 16, 1974</st1:date>" <span class="GramE">was</span> denied for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the
instant petition.</span></p>
