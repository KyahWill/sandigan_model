				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the order <span style="">of </span>the Court of
First Instance of Manila allowing the petitioner, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>,
to take his <span style="">oath of allegiance as a </span><span style="">Filipino </span><span style="">citizen. This case has been submitted for decision without <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1960</st1:date>
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> filed in the lower court a petition for
naturalization as a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 7, 1961 the Solicitor General moved
to <span style="">dismiss the </span>petition on the
ground that "the petition on its face states no cause of action,"
since <span style="">the petitioner's annual income of
P1,800.00, or P150.00 a month, could not be considered as lucrative within the
meaning of the Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
its order </span>of <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="3">March <span style="">8, </span>1961</st1:date>, the lower court
dismissed the petition, but later on, upon motion of the petitioner, <span style="">reconsidered said order and set the petition
for hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner presented evidence tending to show that he was
born in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1936" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1936</st1:date>; that <span style="">since </span>birth he had resided in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
parti­cularly in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, except for
a brief stay of about one month in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Formosa</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sometime in 1958; that at the time of the hearing his residence was at No. 858 <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
while his former residence was at 1758 <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cristo</span></span><span style=""> St., Manila; that he was single, a Chinese
citizen, and registered as such with the Bureau of Immigration and the Embassy
of the Republic of China; that he could speak and write English and <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>; that he completed the elementary course in the
Anglo-Chinese School during the school year 1950-51; that he graduated from the
high <span style="">school department </span>of the
University of the East during the school year 1955-56; that in 1959 he had an
income of P1,780.00 <span style="">and in </span>1960,
the year the petition was filed, he had an income of p1,827.28; that he derived
his income from his employment as a salesman of the </span><span style="">East </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Hongkong</span></span><span style=""> Food Com<span style="">mercial </span>Company,
a firm partly owned by his brother, where he himself had a share in the
capital; and that he was living with his brother who provided him with free
board and lodging.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two witnesses, both
residents of <span class="SpellE">Gapan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, who claimed to have known the peti­tioner since
1949, vouched for his good moral character and irreproachable conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the evidence, the lower court rendered its
decision on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1962</st1:date>,
granting the petition, subject to the provisions of Republic Act No. 530.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal was taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
by the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1964</st1:date>
the petitioner filed a petition to take his oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several hearings the Solicitor General
filed an Opposition and Motion to Dismiss on the following grounds, namely: (1)
that the court did not acquire jurisdiction to hear the petition for naturaliza­tion
because of the failure of the petitioner to file <span style="">a declaration of intention; (2) that the petitioner was without
lucrative income; and (3) <span style="">that the
petitioner's character witnesses were not credible persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated </span></span><st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="2"><span style="">February 22, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court
overruled </span><span style="">the opposition of the
Solicitor General and granted the petition for oath taking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the Solicitor General interposed this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1965</st1:date>,
even before the expiration of the time to appeal, the trial <span style="">Judge </span>administered the <span style="">oath of allegiance to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Upon
motion of the Solicitor General, </span>this Court <span style="">issued a preliminary injunction on September 24, 1965, enjoining the
clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila from issuing </span>a
certificate of naturalization to the <span style="">petitioner,
and likewise enjoining </span>the petitioner from representing him­self as a
Filipino citizen and from exercising any of the rights and privileges
appertaining to such citizen­ship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Of the several grounds relied upon by the Solicitor General, we
need consider, only one, namely, that the petitioner lacked the qualification
of lucrative income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">rule is </span>settled that <span style="">this qualification is determined as of the
date of filing the petition, and increases in </span>the <span style="">earnings </span>thereafter cannot <span style="">be taken into consideration.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Here, </span>the petitioner's <span style="">income in </span>1960, the year when the
petition was filed, was P1,827.28, or approximately P150.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In
pre­vious decisions </span>of this Court, it <span style="">was held that even for an unmarried applicant, P200.00 a month, with free
board and lodging, </span>could not be considered as a <span style="">lucrative income in 1960.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
administration of the oath to the petitioner even before the expiration of the
time to appeal, this Court had on several occa­sions expressed its disapproval
of such practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Finally, we must agree with the government's stand that the
act of the court of first instance in allowing this applicant to take the oath
of allegiance even before the expiration of the Government's period to appeal
from <span style="">the order overruling its
objections thereto, and, in fact, three (3) days before the Solicitor General received
copy of the appealed order, is highly irregular, to say the least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 530 contemplates that the ap­plicant
for naturalization becomes entitled to all the privileges of citi­zenship upon
taking the oath of allegiance, and precipitate administration of the oath in
present case appears to be an attempt to render nugatory the Government's
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record <span style="">is </span>devoid of any justification for
such unseemly haste in conferring the privileges of citizenship before any and
all doubts about appli­cant's right thereto are finally settled and we must
make of record our disapproval </span>of the practice."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby reversed, the
petition for naturalization is dismissed, the oath of allegiance taken by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is declared without force and effect; and the
preliminary injunction heretofore issued is made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
