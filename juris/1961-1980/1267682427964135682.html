<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In an amended complaint dated May 
12, 1960 filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> (Civil Case No. 373) against Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, Lucia <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> D. Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Degollacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, the plaintiff 
Republic of the Philippines sought the annulment of titles allegedly obtained by 
the defendants over portions of the territorial waters of the public domain. It 
was alleged that the defendant company caused the survey and preparation of a 
composite plan of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, increasing its 
area from 9,652.5833 hectares (as evidenced by TCT No. 722) to 12,000 hectares, 
by taking or including therein lands of public dominion. Thus, plaintiff also 
prayed for recovery of possession of such areas in excess of those covered by 
TCT No. 722, and for which fishpond permits were already issued in favor of bona 
fide applicants; for damages in the sum of P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, 
and for a restraining order to enjoin defendants from exercising further acts of 
ownership. Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and 22 others alleged 
holders of fishpond permits issued by the Bureau of Fisheries over the areas 
supposedly outside the boundaries of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, were allowed to intervene in the case and make 
demand for recovery of possession of said areas, and claim for damages for the 
deprivation of possession thereof allegedly by the illegal acts of 
defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendant, while admitting that 
there really existed a difference between the area (of the Hacienda) as 
appearing in TCT No. 722 and the plan prepared by the commissioned private 
surveyor for the company, contend that the excess (of area) was insignificant in 
nature and attributable to the inaccuracy of the magnetic survey that was used 
in the preparation of the plan upon which OCT No. 20 (and later, TCT 722) was 
based.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After trial, during which the 
parties presented documentary and testimonial evidence, the court rendered 
judgment annulling TCT No. T-9550 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, issued to defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> covering Lots 360, 362, 363 and 182, as well as other 
subdivision titles issued to Ayala y <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cia</span></span>. and/or Hacienda de <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> over the areas outside its private property 
covered by TCT No. 722, and ordering defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> 
to vacate Lot No. 360 in favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel 
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, and all the defendants to pay said <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, jointly and severally compensatory damages in 
the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a year per hectare of Lot 360, 
until he is placed in possession thereof. Defendants were also restrained from 
exercising acts of ownership over said Lots 360, 362, 1363, and 182 of 
Psd-40891. This ruling was based upon the finding that the disputed areas form 
part of the navigable water, or are portions of the sea, beach and foreshores of 
the bay. However, as the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, other than 
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, failed to establish with 
particularity the lots allegedly covered by their respective permits or to name 
the present possessors or occupants thereof, and as Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>, and the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> were the only ones <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as parties-defendants, the judgment was made 
effective exclusively against them. Thus, Lot No. 360, included in TCT No. 
T-9550 in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, and proved by <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> to be 
the portion covered by the fishpond permit issued to him, was ordered by the 
court delivered to said <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>. As a consequence 
of this decision, a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, to place the 
plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in possession of the disputed 
properties, was issued by the court. However, by order of May 3, 1961 the same 
was set aside on the ground that in the issuance thereof the defendants were not 
given their day in court. The motion for reconsideration of this order was 
denied on October 5, 1962, for the reason, among <span class="GramE">others, 
that</span> as defendants have always been in possession of the stream in 
question, to order delivery of such possession to the other parties at this 
stage of the proceeding will result in injuries and promote confusion. Both 
parties appealed directly to this Court: the plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">jntervenors</span> claiming that the court erred in not awarding 
damages to the <span class="GramE">plaintiff</span> State; in holding that the 
areas claimed by the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> other than Miguel 
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> were not duly identified; and in suspending 
the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction which had been executed and served 
by the Provincial Sheriff. Defendants, on the other hand, claim that the trial 
court was in error in finding that Lots 360, 362, 363, and 182 of Psd-40891 are 
outside the boundaries of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>, as 
delimited in TCT 722, and in ordering for their reversion to the public 
dominion; in annulling TCT No. T-9550 issued to defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span>, and in ordering the latter to deliver possession of 
Lot 360 to <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>; in ordering defendants to pay said <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> compensatory damages, and in not declaring the 
defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> entitled to reimbursement of all 
necessary expenses made on the properties in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We have gone over the evidence 
presented in this case and found no reason to disturb the factual findings of 
the trial court. It has been established that certain areas originally portions 
of the navigable water or of the foreshores of the bay were converted into 
fishponds or sold by <span class="GramE">defendant company</span> to third 
persons. There is also no controversy as to the fact that the said defendant was 
able to <span class="GramE">effect</span> these sales after it has obtained a 
certificate of title (TCT No. 722) and prepared a "composite plan" wherein the 
aforesaid foreshore areas appeared to be parts of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span>. Defendants-appellants do not deny that there is 
an excess in area between those delimited as boundaries of the hacienda in TCT 
No. 722 and the plan prepared by its surveyor. This, however, was justified by 
claiming that it could have been caused by the system (magnetic survey) used in 
the preparation of the original titles, and anyway, the excess in area (526 
hectares, according to defendants) is within the allowable margin given to a 
magnetic survey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But even assuming for the sake of 
argument that this contention is correct, the fact remains that the areas in 
dispute (those covered by permits issued by the Bureau of Fisheries) were found 
to be portions of the foreshore, beach, or of the navigable water <span class="GramE">itself</span>. And, it is an elementary principle of law that said 
areas not being capable of registration, their inclusion hi a certificate of 
title does not convert the same into properties of private ownership or confer 
title on the registrant<span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>1]</sup></span> 
In the present case, as the lots covered by TCT No. T-9550 issued in the names 
of defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> (and which were purchased by the 
latter from defendants Ayala y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., and/or Alfonso 
<span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>) were found to be portions of the foreshore or 
of the territorial waters, the lower court committed no error in rendering 
judgment against said defendants and ordering the reversion of said properties 
to the public dominion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">However, as we have ruled in the 
case of <span class="SpellE"><i>Dizon</i></span><i>, et al. vs. Rodriguez, etc., 
et al</i>.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[2]</sup></span> there being no showing 
defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> are not purchasers in good faith and 
for value, they have a right to retention of the property until they are 
reimbursed of the necessary expenses on the land, which must properly be 
established and determined. It also follows that as such possessors in good 
faith, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Dizons</span> cannot also be held 
liable for damages allegedly suffered by other parties on account of their 
possession of the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view of the foregoing, the 
revocation of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction previously issued by 
the lower court, and the suspension of the delivery of possession of the 
properties to plaintiff and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, were in order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, thus modified, the decision of 
the lower court appealed from is hereby affirmed. No costs.
