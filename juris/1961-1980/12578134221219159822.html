				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Pines Hotel Employees Association filed &nbsp;on February 24, 1960 before the Court &nbsp;of Industrial Relations a petition praying, among other things, that its employees who were working at the Pines Hotel be &nbsp;paid additional compensation &nbsp;for overtime service rendered due to the exigencies of the business, as well as additional &nbsp;compensation &nbsp;for &nbsp;Sunday, legal holiday &nbsp;and &nbsp;night time work. <p>The Manila &nbsp;Hotel filed its answer denying the &nbsp;material averments &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;petition &nbsp;and alleging, &nbsp;among others, that if &nbsp;overtime service &nbsp;was rendered the same &nbsp;was not authorized but was rendered &nbsp;voluntarily, &nbsp;for the employees were interested in the "tips" &nbsp;offered &nbsp;by the patrons of the hotel.</p> <p>Presiding Judge Jose S. Bautista, to whom the petition was assigned, &nbsp;after trial, rendered judgment stating that the employees were entitled to the additional compensation demanded, &nbsp; including that for &nbsp;overtime work, because an employee who &nbsp;renders overtime service is entitled to compensation even if he rendered it without prior authority. A motion for reconsideration was filed on the ground that the order was contrary to law and the evidence, but the same was denied by the industrial court <i>en banc.</i> </p> <p>In compliance with the order of the court, the Examining Division of the Court of Industrial &nbsp;Relations submitted a report in which it stated &nbsp;that the amount due the employees as additional compensation for overtime and night services &nbsp;rendered &nbsp;from &nbsp;January to December 31, 1958 was P32,950.69. &nbsp;The management filed its objection to the report on the &nbsp;ground that it included 22 names of employees who were &nbsp;not employees &nbsp;of the Pines Hotel at the time the &nbsp;petition &nbsp;was filed &nbsp;so that insofar as said employees are concerned the petition merely involves &nbsp;a money claim which comes &nbsp;under &nbsp;the jurisdiction &nbsp;of the regular &nbsp;courts. &nbsp;The trial judge, however, overruled &nbsp;this objection holding that, while &nbsp;the 22 employees were actually not in the service at the time of the &nbsp;filing of the petition, they were however subsequently employed even during the pendency of the incident, and so their claim comes within the jurisdiction &nbsp;of the Court of Industrial Relations. Hence the present petition for &nbsp;review.</p> <p>There is no merit in this appeal it appearing &nbsp;that while it is true that the 22 employees whose claim is objected to were not actually in the service at the time the instant petition &nbsp;was filed, they were &nbsp;however subsequently reemployed &nbsp;even &nbsp;while the present incident &nbsp;was pending consideration by the trial court. Moreover, it appears that the questioned employees were never separated from the service. Their &nbsp;status is that &nbsp;of regular seasonal employees who are called &nbsp;to &nbsp;work &nbsp;from time to time, &nbsp;mostly during summer season. &nbsp;The nature of their relationship with the hotel &nbsp;is such &nbsp;that during &nbsp;off season they are temporarily laid off but during summer &nbsp;season they are re-employed, &nbsp;or when their services may be needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;They are not strictly &nbsp;speaking separated from &nbsp;the services but are: merely considered as on leave of absence without pay until they are re-employed. &nbsp;Their employment relationship is never severed but only &nbsp;suspended. As such, these employees can be considered as in the regular employment of the hotel.</p> <p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is &nbsp;affirmed. &nbsp;No costs.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, ConcepCion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> &nbsp;and <i> Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</p> </div>
