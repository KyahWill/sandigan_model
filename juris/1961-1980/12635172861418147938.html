				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">With the judiciary called upon to apply the law on the facts as
found by it and with the supremacy of the Constitution as a cardinal postulate,
the exercise of the power of judicial review by a court of justice, an inferior
tribunal not excepted, is unavoidable.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There are times, and not infrequently either, when both <span style="">a </span>constitutional provision and <span style="">a </span>statute may govern the matter before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event, therefore, that there is a
contrariety or repugnancy between them, such delicate and awesome power comes
into play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even prior to adjudication,
at <span class="GramE">the</span> inception of a lawsuit, a party who seeks to
annul such legislative act may pray for <span style="">a
</span>writ of preliminary injunction so that its operation could be arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it was in this case, respondent Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, now retired, indulging the other respondents<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

injunction against the enforcement of the Tax Census Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

through this special civil action of certiorari and prohibition would have the
validity of such preliminary injunction tested.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the initial issue before us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the event that there was such an improvident exercise <span style="">of </span>the power to issue a writ of
preliminary injunction, does a petition for certiorari and prohibi­tion lie?
That question, we must likewise resolve.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other respondents, on <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1966</st1:date>, started <span style="">a </span>special
civil action for prohibition and injunction in the sale of respondent Judge,
seeking to declare the Tax Census Act<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">as </span>unconstitutional, illegal and in­valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents in that suit were the
Commission­er of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of Finance and the Executive
Secretary, now the petitioners before us.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reference was made to its first section, which would require of
every resident of the Philippines over 18 years of age within the month of
February, 1962 and thereafter within the same month every four years to file
with the City of Municipal Treasurer in a form prescribed by the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of Finance, a statement
under oath containing such data as the name; age; sex; nationality (if alien,
the number of the Alien Regis­tration Certificate, and aliases used, or
authorized to be used, <span style="">if </span>any):
address; occupation; place of business; wife's or husband's name, age, sex,
occupation and place of business; and the members of his family, age and sex<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as real property owned, stating the nature thereof, location <span style="">and assessed </span>value thereof, and the
annual gross income <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> during the preceding
year; property held under lease stating also the nature, location and assessed
value thereof and the annual income during the preceding year; business subject
to tax giving the nature and location thereof and the annual gross receipts or
earnings during the preceding year; stocks in corporations or shares in
partnerships or associations; inventories of assets particularly machineries
and buildings, merchandise on <span style="">hand, </span>unfinished
goods and raw materials on hand, short and long term re­ceivables, and
investments in stocks and bonds; pro­fessions or occupations, stating the kind
and location thereof and the annual salaries or gross receipts or earnings
during the preceding year; and personal properties except those worth less than
five hundred pesos.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Two other sections were likewise cited in the petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It was then alleged that the Tax Census Act has been enforced and implemented
since 1962 and that the parties who filed the suit, now respondents before us,
"are required to make and file Sworn Statements of Assets, Income <span style="">and </span>Liabilities" in accordance
with the Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It was likewise asserted that the then Senator <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Osias</span> filed a bill to repeal such legislation and
that the Secretary of Finance had admitted that it had not been able to produce
the result expected from it, the information yielded not justifying the trouble
caused not only to the public but also to the government.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The main portion of the petition before respondent Judge dealt
with the alleged infirmity of the Tax Census Act as being <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the constitutional right to liberty, to the guarantee against
self-incrimination and the protection against unreasonable searches and
seizures with a citation from both Phil­ippine and American cases in support of
such a plea.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
A writ of preliminary injunction was therein likewise sought, the argument
being advanced that the other respondents before us in the petition before
respondent Judge "would suffer great and irreparable damage arising from
the non-filing of their Sworn Statement of Assets, Income and Liabilities, as
they are subject to crim­inal prosecution under Section 5 of the Tax Census Law
which is in clear violation of herein petitioners' aforesaid constitutional and
legal rights and which would render the judgment in favor of herein petitioners
ineffectual."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The present petitioners, as respondents in such special civil
action, in their answer filed on February 18, 1966, after denying specifically
the allegations contained in the petition intended to establish the
unconstitutionality of the Tax Census Act, emphasized in the special and
affirmative defenses interposed that such an enactment was intended to
implement the govern­mental function "for a just, equal and efficient
system of collecting taxes." The purpose of Republic Act No. 2070, in the
language of its authors, Senators <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> and Roy, <span style="">is </span>to provide "for a national
tax census and the keeping of national registers in every city and municipality
of the Philippines, * * * to provide the Department of Finance <span style="">and </span>the Bureau of Internal Revenue
with vital tax statistics upon which they can formulate sound policies and
recommend reforms in the tax system and in revenue to achieve efficiency and
honesty in the collection of taxes. * * * It is be­lieved that the
establishment of a national tax census will enhance revenue collection,
minimize evasion of taxes, promote honesty and efficiency in revenue admin­istration
and, above all, give fair assurance that every citizen pays his just proportion
of the public burden, and thus develop in this country tax conscious­ness which
is vital to tax collection,'; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Stress was likewise laid on the undeniable power of Congress to enact such <span style="">a </span>measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="GramE">came</span> an
extended discussion to demonstrate that the right against self-incrimination as
well as the right against unreasonable searches and seizures did not suffer any
infringement as a result of the challenged legislation.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
There was <span style="">a </span>vehement opposition
to the plea for preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The prayer was for a denial of the preliminary injunction and the dismissal of
the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the order of respondent Judge of February 21, 1966,
which <span style="">is </span>the basis of the
present petition for certiorari and prohibition, noting that a hearing on the
plea for the issuance of the writ for preliminary injunc­tion took place on
February 19, 1966 and ordering the issuance thereof upon the posting of <span style="">a </span>bond of P1,000.00, thus restraining
petitioners before us from requiring the other respondents and other similarly
situated to file their sworn statements of assets, income and liabilities under
Republic Act No. 2070.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
petition for certiorari and prohibition, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in this special civil action seek the setting aside
of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by respondent Judge and would
restrain him perpet­ually from further hearing the suit for prohibition and
injunction pending before him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners predicate their plea on the allegation that respondent Judge
gravely abused his discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction as
the Tax Census Act is valid and constitutional, there being neither any
self-incrimination feature nor unreasonable search and seizure taint, there
being moreover a presumption of its conformity with the fundamental law and no
grave and irreparable injury being suffered by the other respondents,
petitioners before respondent Judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners likewise justify their con­tention that there was a grave abuse of
discretion on the part of respondent Judge in the issuance of such writ of
preliminary injunction due to his failure to consider the serious injury it
would cause the paramount public interest, to realize that the en­forcement of
penal laws cannot thus be restrained and to take note that the other
respondents as petition­ers before him are guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1966</st1:date>, gave due course to the foregoing
petition for certiorari and prohibition and required respondents to file an
answer within 10 days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such an answer was filed on March 8, 1966, where­in after
admitting the jurisdictional facts alleged as well as the statement of the <span style="">case as </span>set forth in the petition,
respondents specifically denied the allegations in the petition to the effect
that Republic Act No. 2070 is valid and constitutional, reference being made to
the alleged violation right against unreasonable searches and seizures.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Then <span class="GramE">came</span> the specific denial of that portion of the
petition which pointed to the alleged grave abuse of discretion of respondent
Judge in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
In their special and affirmative defenses respondents would reiterate their
argument against the validity of the Act for the asserted trans­gression on the
constitutional protection against self-incrimination and against unreasonable
searches and seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did likewise
question its validity as being in excess <span style="">of
</span>the State's taxing power, ignoring the <span style="">fact </span>that the Act is more properly <span class="GramE">a police</span>
power legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the <span style="">case
</span>scheduled for May 16, 1966, nobody appeared for any of the parties, peti­tioners
however filing a motion, seeking a period of 30 days within which to submit a
memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With its filing on <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1966</st1:date>, the arguments set
forth in the petition to uphold the validity of the Tax Census Act being
reiterated therein and the respondents' reply memorandum on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1966</st1:date>, the case was
deemed submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The primary question
before us then is whether respondent Judge ought to have issued the writ of pre­liminary
injunction to restrain the enforcement of the Tax Census Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer must be in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far back <span style="">as </span>March
23, 1909, more than 60 years ago, this Court, in the leading case of <span class="SpellE">Devesa</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Arbes</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
made the categorical pronouncement that the issuance of an injunction is addressed
to the sound discretion of the Court, the exercise of which is con­trolled not
so much by the then applicable sections <span style="">of
</span>the Code of Civil Procedure, now the Rules of Court, but by the accepted
doctrines, one of which is that it should not be granted while the rights
between the parties are undetermined except in extraordinary cases where
material and irreparable injury will be done.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For it <span style="">is </span>an action in
equity appropriate only when there can be no compensation in damages for the
injury thus sustained and where no adequate remedy in law exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">a
</span>holding reflected the prevailing American doctrine that there is no
power "the exercise of which is more delicate, which requires greater
caution, deliberation and sound discretion or more dangerous in a doubtful
case," being "the strong arm of equity, that never ought to be
extended," except where the in­jury is great and irreparable.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have remained committed to such an approach since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only last year, in <span class="SpellE">Palanan</span>
Lumber &amp; Ply­wood Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Arranz</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
we emphasized: "It is not amiss to recall here that time and again this
Court has had occasion to deplore the readiness of some judges to grant and
issue injunctions <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> against acts
of public functionaries, ignoring the presumption of regularity and validity of
official actuations, in disregard of the deference and courtesy due to a co­ordinate
branch of the government, and with no other guide than the far from impartial
assertions in plead­ings of interested parties, which a summary hearing would
have shown to be either dubious or unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The result has been that all too <span class="GramE">often,</span> the
public in­terest has been prejudiced through unnecessary delays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears repeating here that preliminary
injunctions remain <u>extraordinary</u> remedies that should be dispensed with
circumspection, and that both sides should be first heard whenever
possible."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the evil of <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
injunction was stressed in the above excerpt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is equally true that a reminder was made of the extraordinary
character of this remedy "to be dispensed with circumspection" to
avoid its invocation by interested parties whose claims could be shown "to
be either dubious or unfounded." What cannot be sufficiently pointed out
is that a party seeking injunction must show that his right to it must be clear
and unmistakable.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
The propriety of its issuance, therefore, requires unmistakable proof
"that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded and <u>only</u>
when his complaint shows fact entitling him to such relief."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever may be said of the original petition for prohibition and
injunction filed by the other respon­dents before the respondent Judge, it
cannot be plausibly asserted that facts have been alleged which would make
manifest the violation of any of their constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of relying on facts, they contented
themselves with the general allegation that for them the Tax Census Act was
null.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was assailed for presumably
violating the right to liberty, the protection against unreasonable searches
and seizures and the prohibition against self-incrimination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was thus being sought in effect was a
declaration of invalidity based on the belief that its constitution­al
infirmity <span style="">is </span>apparent on its
face.</p>

<p class="BODY">Independently then of whether or not there has been an unwarranted
departure from the governing prin­ciple that the power to issue a preliminary
injunction is not to be availed of indiscriminately, the more specific and
pivotal question is whether it could be exercised to restrain the enforcement
of the Tax Census Act under the circumstances disclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer, to repeat, must be in the
negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the order granting the petition for the issuance of the writ
of preliminary injunction,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
it <span style="">was </span>stated that <span style="">a </span>hearing on the matter took place on
<st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came a summary of the legal arguments ad­vanced
both by the other respondents as petitioners <span style="">and </span>the then Solicitor General, now Justice, Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, on behalf of the petitioners before us, who were
the parties proceeded against before the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent on the face of such order that res­pondent Judge
took into consideration purely legal arguments, no evidence being introduced,
both for and against the validity of the challenged statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, his attention was invited to the
presumption of validity that every legislative act has in its favor as well as
the doctrine that the task <span style="">of </span>suspending
the operation of the law "is a matter of extreme delicacy because that is
an interference with the official acts not only with the duly elected
representatives of the people in Congress but also of the highest magistrate of
the land."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Judge was deaf to the force of such cogent and persuasive
constitutional <span style="">law </span>doctrines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He issued the preliminary injunction none­theless.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is manifest that respondent judge did overstep the bounds of
discretion that set limits to the authority he is entitled to exercise in the
issuance of the pre­liminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of <span style="">a </span>statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no dissent from the proposition
that where the action required of a lower court would be tantamount, even if
only for a temporary period, to disregarding the clearly expressed will of the
two branches of the government, the need for caution is greatest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, respondent Judge was apparently obli­vious
to such <span style="">a </span>need.</p>

<p class="BODY">It might be said, of course, that the issuance of a preliminary
injunction does not have the impress of finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a hearing on the merits, the
legislative act could regain its full vigor and could then be en­forced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is much to be said though in favor of
Cooley's approach in the exercise of what he referred to as the "high
prerogative of declaring a legislative enactment void," <span style="">a </span>lower court, "conscious of the
falli­bility of human judgment" being admonished to manifest the utmost
reluctance.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
That attitude should be displayed even at the stage of considering whether a
pre­liminary injunction should issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had respondent Judge been of such a frame of mind, he would have arrived
at a more acceptable conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
would have refrained from indulging the other respondents in their plea for a
preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">To borrow from the language of Justice Laurel, he was hardly
conscious of the truism "that a becoming modesty of inferior courts demands
conscious realization of the position they occupy in the interrelation and
operation of the integrated judicial system of the nation.”<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
For if note be taken of the rigorous re­quirement of a two-thirds vote for this
Court to annul a statute,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
the confidence displayed by respondent judge in thus restraining the
enforcement of the act does indeed appear to be quite excessive, under all the
circumstances disclosed by the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Correspondingly, it could be interpreted as the failure to observe what
Cooley referred to as "due caution end circumspection" and as well as
"the respect due to the action and judg­ment of the lawmakers."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It might have been different if at the hearing the attention of
respondent Judge was invited to facts which would overcome the presumption of
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with reference to
municipal ordinances, Justice Malcolm so clearly emphasized that "the
presumption is all in favor of validity.”<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="GramE">In the recent decision of <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span> <span class="SpellE">Malate</span> Hotel &amp; Motel Operators <span class="SpellE">Asso</span>.</span>
v. City Mayor of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
we announced the view that as underlying questions of fact may condition the
constitutionality of legislation, "the presumption of constitutionality
must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for
overthrowing the statute." It would appear clear, therefore, that the
force of such a pre­sumption would preclude the issuance of <span style="">a </span>preliminary injunction, unless
there be facts disclosed which would serve to weaken if not to defeat the
presumption of validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such facts
have even been alleged.</p>

<p class="BODY">It could be argued, of course, that what was sought before the
lower court was to declare the Tax Census Act void on its face which would do <span style="">away </span>with the re­quirement of a
factual foundation to establish nullity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that its operation would serve to curtail individual liberty
as every resident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
above 18 years of age would be required to furnish cer­tain information even
against his will, such <span style="">a </span>plea
could indeed have been raised.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
It could then be plausibly maintained that the need for <span style="">a factual </span>founda­tion for invalidity vanishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Support for such a view may be furnished by
the cardinal principle that on the whole the Bill of Rights does raise barriers
to unwar­ranted intrusion and that in such <span style="">a </span>realm the primacy of liberty demands that the individual be
left alone.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That is so but it is equally undeniable that the liberty in its
general sense enshrined by the Consti­tution does not rule out in appropriate
cases legislative deprivation as long as due process is observed.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
While courts should not relax its vigilance in assuring that no undue
curtailment of liberty exists, still it is to be admitted that except in cases
where the specific freedoms of belief whether religious or secular, of ex­pression,
of assembly and of association are concerned,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">a </span>domain where Congress is forbidden
to trespass except under the clear and present, danger doctrine,<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
the need for introducing evidence to counteract the assump­tion that a statute
is valid may be unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence thereof
sufficed to <span style="">cast </span>on the
issuance of the preliminary injunction, now challenged, the mark of a grave
abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such <span style="">a </span>temporary
injunction, in the language of Justice Black, “is in reality <span style="">a </span>suspension of an act, delaying the
date selected by Congress to put its chosen policies into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Judicial] power to stay an act of Congress,
like judicial power to hold an act unconstitutional, is an awesome responsibility
calling for the utmost circumspection in its exercise.”<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Judge was of a different persuasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners thus are
clearly entitled to the writ of certiorari prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge did possess discretion to
issue or not to issue <span style="">a </span>preliminary
in­junction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That discretion, however,
according to the circumstances disclosed, was abused, and abused gravely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on <span style="">a matter </span>of less significance, this Court has not hesitated to
exercise its supervisory authority by correcting such failure to abide by controlling
legal principles with a petition for certiorari as the approp­riate
remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have made that clear in past
pronounce­ments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in a 1919
decision:<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
"We are also of the opinion that the action of <span style="">a </span>Court of First Instance in exercising this power may, under
certain conditions, amount to an abuse of discretion and constitute an
irregularity so far in excess of the proper power of the court as to give rise
to a right in the injured party to have relief by the writ of certiorari."
So also in <span class="SpellE">Silen</span> v. Vera:<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
"Therefore, the respondent Judge acted in excess of his jurisdiction <span style="">and </span>abused his discretion in issuing
the writ of preliminary injunction the nullity of which is sought, and the writ
of certiorari applied for should be issued."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is much greater reason for a writ of prelim­inary
injunction being set aside in this case by the grant of the certiorari prayed
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may serve to deter other
inferior tribunals similarly minded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may serve to induce the conviction on the part of a lower court judge that it
is <span style="">a matter </span>of the utmost
seriousness to stop the enforcement of an act after it has been enacted by a
bicameral legislative body com­posed of the House and the Senate and approved
by the President, two of the coordinate branches of the govern­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The greatest care should thus be taken before
its operation is enjoined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, it
would be mani­festing not judicial timidity but judicial wisdom.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say that in no case should a writ of preliminary
injunction issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are times the
exercise of such an authority <span style="">is </span>appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus when there is an invasion of the
preferred freedoms of belief, of expression <span style="">as </span>well as the cognate rights to freedom of assembly and
association, an affirmative response to a plea for preliminary injunction would
indeed be called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The primacy of the
freedom of the mind is entitled to the highest respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not such <span style="">a case, </span>however, and the writ of certiorari must be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners likewise
seek from us <span style="">a </span>writ of prohibition
to restrain respondent Judge "from further hearing the petition before him
filed by the other respondents to annul and declare invalid the Tax Census
Act." Considering that as of now what had transpired was merely the
hearing on the preliminary injunction, this particular prayer obviously poses a
more difficult question than the plea for <span style="">a </span>writ of certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There may be cases where at this particular stage reached, prohibition
may be granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
After due reflection, we feel that it is not one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To call a halt to <span style="">any </span>further proceeding before respondent Judge in connection
with this particular suit before him to validate such legislative act might be
to run the risk of acting prematurely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the lower court is possessed of the power to act in the premises,
respect must be accorded such authority in the absence of any compelling reason
justifying direct action on our part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is our conclusion that under the circumstances disclosed, pro­hibition does not
lie.</p>
