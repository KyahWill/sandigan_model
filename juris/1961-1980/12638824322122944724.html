				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the lease of a parcel of foreshore land of the
public domain with an area of about four and one-half hec­tares located at
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Kaiñgin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kawit</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city> abutting on <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and the <span class="SpellE">Ankaw</span> Creek.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a protracted controversy that has been pending for more
than thirty years between the rival claimants, Julian <span class="SpellE">San­tulan</span>
and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span>, who have been succeeded by their
heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> claimed that that foreshore
land is an extension of his land, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 986 of the <span class="SpellE">Kawit</span> cadastre, with an area of 17,301 square meters,
registered in his name in 1937 under Original Certificate of Title No. 6 which
was issued by virtue of a free patent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The northern boundary of Lot No. 986 is <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>
(Manila) Bay (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said foreshore land was allegedly formed
by soil deposits accumulated by the alluvial action of the sea.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 5, 1942 <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> caused the
said land to be surveyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The survey
plan was approved by the Director of Lands in 1944 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1942">December 29, 1942</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>,
pursuant to Lands Administrative Order No. 7-1, filed an application, F. L.A.
No. V-562, to lease or five years for agricultural purposes an area of 36,120
square meters of the said foreshore land (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F).</p>

<p class="BODY">On that same date, <st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1942">December
 29, 1942</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>, pursuant to Act No.
3077 and Lands Administrative Order No. 8-3, filed with the Bureau of Lands an
application for a revocable permit to occupy the said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He indicated therein that he would use <span style="">the land for "<span class="SpellE">capiz</span>
beds and oyster beds, the planting of </span><span class="SpellE"><u>bakawan</u></span><span style=""> and </span><span class="SpellE"><u>pagatpat</u></span>
<span style="">and later to be developed into a
fishpond" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Seven years later, or on December 22, 1949, <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>
filed with the Bureau of Fisheries an application for an ordinary fishpond
permit or lease, of the said foreshore land (Special Use Permit, <span class="SpellE">Fp</span>. A. No. 5114, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">H).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the instance of the Director of Fisheries, the Director of
Forestry investigated the condition of the said foreshore land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter in his first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
dated June 19, 1950 found <span style="">that </span>it
was swampy "and not an improved fishpond as alleged by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span>" and that it is within the disposable areas for
agricultural purposes under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Lands (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">L-1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The chief of the division of commercial fisheries sent a letter
to <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> dated April 28, 1950 apprising him that he
was reported to have illegally entered the area covered by <span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span>
fishpond permit application and directing him to refrain from introducing improvements,
with the warning that court proceedings would be taken against him (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1951">January 12, 1951</st1:date>
an attorney, acting for the Director of Lands wrote the following letter to <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> advising him to vacate the disputed land and maintain
the status quo:</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Caiñgin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kawit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"S <span class="SpellE">i</span> r:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"We have been informed that the area which is presently <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by and between you and Julian <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>, under the applications noted above, was recently
entered by <u><span style="">you and some companions</span></u><span style=""> </span>and that you are destroying the dikes
and other im­provements previously constructed thereon by said Julian <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"If this information is true, and inasmuch as you are aware
that the controversy is still pending final <span class="SpellE">adjudgment</span>
in this Office, it is desired that you take proper advice and leave the area
and its existing improvements in status quo in order to avoid possible
confusion of rights which may delay the final disposi­tion of the area in
question.</p>

<p class="2Q">"You are advised further that the acts imputed to you may make
you liable to prosecution and punish­ment under the law; and that whatever
improvements you may make for yourself in the premises will not legally accrue
to your benefit, nor will they serve as <span style="">basis
for a claim to preferential rights." (Para</span>graphing supplied, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J-1).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>
declared the said foreshore land in his name for tax purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tax Declaration No. 2923, which took effect
in 1948 and which cancelled Tax Declaration No. 13816 also in <span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span> name, shows that the land was assessed at P460.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He paid the realty taxes due on the said land
for the years 1945-46, <span style="">1948-55 and
1957-60 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C, D and E, </span><u>et seq.</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> in
1942 and 1945 (he died in 1962) filed with the Bureau of Lands applications for
a revocable permit and lease of a foreshore land, respectively, for the purpose
of producing salt on the said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed that he had been in the continuous and exclusive possession of that
land since 1920, when it was still under water, and that he had used it as a site
of his fish corrals.</p>

<p class="BODY">He allegedly converted two hectares of the said land into a
fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire area was enclosed
with mud dikes and provided with a concrete sluice gate and another sluice gate
made of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the northern part of
the land bordering the bay were bamboo stakes placed at close intervals to
serve as water breakers to protect the mud dikes from being washed away by the
action of the sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lusin</span>
introduced the alleged improvements from 1951 to 1953.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1942 foreshore lease applications of <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> gave rise to Bureau of Lands Conflict No. 8
(N).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Lands in his
decision in that case dated February 1, 1951 found that the disputed land is
foreshore land covered and uncovered by the flow and ebb of the ordinary tides;
that it is an extension of <span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span> Lot No. 986 and
it was formerly a part of the sea; that <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> was
the first to enter the land and to make dikes thereon, and that <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> entered the land later and made dikes also (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K made a part hereof for reference as Annex A).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director ruled that the disputed foreshore land was subject
"to riparian rights which may be invoked by <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>
as owner of the upland in accordance with section 32 of <span style="">Lands Administrative Order No. 7-1" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
K).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Director rejected <span class="SpellE">Lusin's</span> application for a foreshore lease and for a
revocable permit and gave due course to <span class="SpellE">Santulan'<span style="">s</span></span></span>
foreshore lease application.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> filed a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director in his
order of October 19, 1951 denied that motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He found that <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> was a possessor in bad
faith; that it is not true that <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> had improved
and possessed the said foreshore land for twenty years; that the disputed area
is covered by water, two to three feet deep during ordinary tides and is
exposed land after the ebb of the tides, and that <span class="SpellE">Lusin's</span>
alleged possession and improvements could not nullify <span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span>
preferential right to lease the land by reason of his riparian rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director ordered <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span>
to vacate the land within sixty days from notice (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
L made a part hereof for reference as Annex B).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> appealed to the Acting Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources who in his decision of October 13, 1952
dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Director's 1951 decision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. M made a part hereof for reference as Annex C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lusin's</span> motion for
reconsideration was denied in the Secretary's order of February 28, 1953 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. N made a part hereof for reference as Annex D).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> asked for a reinvestigation of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His re­quest was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Department ordered a reinvestigation on
May 12, 1953.</p>

<p class="BODY">After receipt of the report of reinvestigation, the Under­secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, by authority of the Secretary, in his
order of December 14, 1954, reaffirmed the rejection of <span class="SpellE">Lusin's</span>
revocable permit and foreshore lease applications but ordered <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> to reimburse to <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span>
the appraised value of his improvements (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. O made
a part hereof for reference as Annex E).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lusin</span> appealed to the President of the
Philippines after his motion for reconsideration was denied in the
Undersecretary's order of May 19, 1955 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. OO made
a part hereof for reference as Annex F).</p>

<p class="BODY">Executive Secretary Juan C. <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>, by
authority of the President, held in his decision of April 10, 1958 that section
32 of Lands Administrative Order No. 7-1 (promulgated by the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources on April 30, 1936 pursuant to Acts Nos. 2874
and 3038) was "rendered obsolete" by section 67 of the Public Land
Law which took effect on December 1, 1936 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. P
made a part hereof for reference as Annex G).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing ruling and since the record is
silent as to whether or not the land in question has been de­clared by the President
as not necessary for the public service and as open to disposition (Sec. 61,
Public Land Law), the Exe­cutive Secretary sustained <span class="SpellE">Lusin's</span>
appeal and reversed the orders of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources in favor of <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secretary <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>
decided the case in the alternative as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On the assumption that the land in question has been declared
open for disposition and is not neces­sary for the public service, this Office
directs that an oral bidding for the leasing thereof to interested par­ties
pursuant to the provisions of Section 67 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 be
conducted and the contract of lease awarded to the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whoever shall be the highest bidder, if other
than the appellant, shall be required to pay to the appellant the appraised
value of the improvements introduced by him on the land to be determined by
that Department.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the land in question has not been so de­clared, this
Office directs that a revocable permit under Section 68 of Commonwealth Act No.
141 be issued to the appellant requiring him to pay permit fees since the year
1951.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the orders and decisions of that Department and
the Bureau of Lands are hereby revoked."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span> case was distinguished from
that of Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span> whose Lot No. 987 adjoins <span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span> Lot No. 986.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Executive Secretary Fred Ruiz Castro (now Chief Justice) in his decision
of May 10, 1954 upheld the preferential right of <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span>
to lease the foreshore land north of his lot, which foreshore land is adjacent
to the foreshore land now in dispute <span style="">in
this case (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. Q made a part hereof for reference as
Annex H).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span> motion for reconsideration
was denied in the letter of the Acting Executive Secretary dated August 20,
1959 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. W).</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 22, 1959 <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> filed in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
wherein he alleged that the Executive Secretary committed a grave abuse of
discre­tion in misinterpreting certain provisions of Act No. 2874, Com­monwealth
Act No. 141, and Lands Administrative Order No. 7-1.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the lower court the parties agreed that the case involves only
a question of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 18, 1961
the lower court dis­missed the petition and affirmed the Executive Secretary's
deci­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>
appealed to the Court of Appeals which in its resolution of July 21, 1967
elevated the record to this Court on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span>
in his brief raised only the legal questions of whether the Public Land Law
repealed section 32 of Lands Administrative Order No. 7-1 and whether the
Executive Secretary's decision is "legally sound and correct" (CA-G.
R. No. 30708-R).</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be emphasized that, as found by the investigators of
the Bureau of Lands, <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> was the prior possessor
of the foreshore land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had it surveyed in 1942.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The survey plan
(Psu-115357) was approved by the Director of Lands in 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> paid the
realty taxes on that land.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should further be underscored that the regulations give him a
preferential right to lease the land as a riparian owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lands Administrative Order No. 7-1 dated
April 30, 1936, which was issued by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources upon the recommendation of the Director of Lands for the disposi­tion<span style=""> of alienable lands of the public domain,
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"32. <u><span style="">Preference of Riparian Owner</span></u><span style="">.- </span>The owner of the property adjoining
foreshore lands, marshy lands or lands covered with water bordering upon shores
or banks of navigable lakes or rivers, shall be given preference to apply for
such lands adjoining his property as may not be needed for the public service,
subject to<span style=""> the laws and regulations
governing lands of this nature, provided that he applies <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
within sixty (60) days from the date he receives a communication from the
Director of Lands advising him of his preferential right."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 32 quoted above is a substantial copy of paragraph 4 of
Lands Administrative Order No. 8-3 dated April 20, 1936, which was promulgated
by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources upon the recommendation
of the Director of Lands for issuance of temporary permits of occupation and
use of agricultural lands of the public domain.</p>

<p class="BODY">The word "riparian" in paragraphs 32 and 4 of the
departmental regulations is used in a broad sense as referring to any property
having a water frontage (Shepard's Point Land Co. vs. Atlantic Hotel, 44 S. E.
39, 45, 132 <span style="">N. </span>C. 517, 65 C. J.
S. 143, note 84).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strictly speaking,
"riparian" refers to rivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
riparian owner is a person who owns land situated on the bank of a river.</p>

<p class="BODY">But in <span style="">paragraphs 32 and
4, the term "riparian owner" embraces not only the owners of lands on
the banks of rivers </span>but also the littoral owners, meaning the owners of
lands bordering the shore of the sea or lake or other tidal waters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The littoral is the coastal region including
both the land along the coast and <span style="">the
water near the coast or the shore zone between </span><span style="">the high and </span><span style="">low </span><span style="">watermarks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, on the basis of paragraphs 32 and 4 of the said
administrative regulations, <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> or his heirs
should be allowed to lease or occupy the said <span style="">foreshore land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But the Executive Secretary ruled that paragraph 32 was rendered
obsolete by Commonwealth Act No. 141 or, as held by the trial court, Lands
Administrative Order No. 7-1 was re­pealed by the Public Land Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that conclusion correct? We hold that it
is wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Lands Administrative Orders Nos. 7-1 and 8-3 were
issued when the 1919 Public Land Act was in force or before the present Public
Land Law took effect on December 1, 1936.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that circumstance would not necessarily mean that<span style=""> the said departmental regulations are not
good under the 1936 Public Land Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In rationalizing the alleged repeal of paragraph 32, the
Executive Secretary cited the following provisions of Act No. 2874, the 1919
Public Land Act (15 Public Land Laws 24):</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 64. The lease or sale shall be adjudicated to the
highest bidder; and if there is no bidder besides the applicant, it shall be
adjudicated to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisions of
section twenty-seven of this Act shall be applied wherever applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If all or part of the lots remain <span class="SpellE">unleased</span> or unsold, the Director of Lands shall from time
to time announce in the <u><span style="">Official
Gazette</span></u><span style=""> </span>or otherwise
the lease or sale of those lots, if necessary." (Section 27 refers to <u><span style="">sealed</span></u><span style=""> </span>bidding).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Secretary held that the above-quoted section 64 was
repealed by the following provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 141 which took
effect on December 1, 1936:</p>

<blockquote>'SEC. 67. The lease or sale shall be made through oral bidding; and
adjudication shall be made to the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, where an applicant has made
improvements on the land b<span style="">y </span>virtue of a permit issued to him by competent authority, the
sale or lease shall be made by sealed bidding as prescribed in section
twenty-six of this Act, the provisions of which shall be applied wherever
applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If all or part of the lots
remain <span class="SpellE">unleased</span> or unsold, the Director of Lands
shall from time to time announce in the <u>Official </u><u><span style="">Gazette</span></u><span style="">, </span>or in any other newspapers of general circulation, the lease
or sale of those lots, if neces­sary." (Section 26, like section 27 of Act
No. 2874, refers to sealed bidding).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Secretary noted that under section 64 of Act No.
2874 <u><span style="">sealed </span>bidding</u> was
the general rule of procedure in determining an award of a lease of foreshore
land and that the applicant is entitled to equal the bid of the highest
bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, under section
67, <u>oral bidding</u> is the general rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the Executive Secretary assumed that, while under section
64 of the 1919 old Public Land Act, the fact that the applicant has a
preferential right to lease foreshore land was a crucial factor, it is
unimportant under section 67 of the 1936 Public Land Law because in oral
bidding the applicant is not entitled to equal the bid of the highest bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Secretary concluded that, because the preferential
right of the applicant to lease foreshore land was immaterial under section 67 of
the present Public Land Law, paragraph 32 of Lands Administrative Order No.
7-1, which gives such preference, had become "idle and useless".</p>

<p class="BODY">That conclusion is wrong because it is based on the erroneous
hypothesis that section 64 of the 1919 Public Land Act is different from
section 67 of the 1936 Public Land Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are not different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth
is that section 64 was amended by Act No. 3517 which took effect on February 4,
1929 (24 Public Laws 416).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 64,
as thus amended, is <u>substantially the same as section 67 of the 1936 Public
Land Law</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>That fact was overlooked by the Executive Secretary</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, his conclusion, that paragraph 32 of
Lands Administra­tive Order No. 7-1 was repealed or rendered obsolete by sec­tion
67 of the present Public Land Law, is wrong because its premise is wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, paragraph 32 of Lands Administrative Order No.
7-1, issued on April 30, 1936, was promulgated under section 64 of the old
Public Land Law, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since <span style="">the amended section 64 was substantially
reproduced in section 67 of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">present Public Land Law, it is glaringly
incorrect to say that section 67 rendered obsolete the said paragraph 32.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 32 is still in force and is good
under the existing Public Land Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussion reveals that the Executive Secre­tary's
rationalization of the alleged repeal of paragraph 32 of Lands Administrative
Order No. 7-1 (identical to paragraph 4 of Lands Administrative Order No. 8-3)
is not only deficient in clarity and cogency but is predicated on the false
assumption that section 64 of the 1919 Public Land Act is different from
section 67 of the present Public Land Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the aforementioned decision of Executive Secretary Juan C.
<span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> under review has to be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case is governed by the precedent established in the case of

<p class="BODY">Considering that the foreshore land abutting upon <span class="SpellE">Santulan's</span> lot is in the same situation as the foreshore
land abutting upon <span class="SpellE">Monzon's</span> lot, there is no reason
why <span class="SpellE">Santulan</span> should not enjoy, with respect to the
disputed foreshore land, the rights given to <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span>
over the foreshore land adjacent to his lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, then, is there any justification for giving to the littoral
owner the preferential right to lease the foreshore land abutting on his land?</p>

<p class="BODY">That rule in paragraph 32 is in consonance with article 4 of the
Spanish Law of Waters of 1866 which provides that, while lands added to the
shores by accretions and alluvial deposits caused by the action of the sea form
part of the public domain, such lands, "when they are no longer washed by
the waters of the sea and are not necessary for purposes of public utility, or
for the establishment of special industries, or for the coast guard
service", shall be declared by the Government <span style="">"<u>to be the property of the owners of the estates adjacent
thereto and as increment thereof</u>" </span><span style="">(cited in Ignacio vs. Director of Lands, 108 Phil. 335, 338).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, article 4 recognizes the preferential right of
the littoral owner (riparian according to paragraph 32) to the foreshore land
formed by accretions or alluvial deposits due to the action of the sea (<span class="SpellE">Ker</span> &amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cauden</span>, 6 Phil.
732, 736, 223 U. S. 268, 56 L. Ed. 432, 435; <span class="SpellE">Jover</span>
vs. Insular Government, 10 Phil. 522, 40 Phil. 1094, 1100, 221 U. S. 623, 55 L.
Ed. 884).</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for <span style="">that </span>preferential
right is the same as the <span style="">justification
for giving accretions to the riparian owner, which is that accretion </span>compensates
<span style="">the riparian owner for the diminutions
which his land suffers by reason of the destructive force of the waters (Cortes
vs. City of Manila, 10 Phil. 567).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
in the case of littoral lands, he who loses by the encroachments of the sea
should gain by its recession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Banks vs.
Ogden, 2 Wall. 57, 67, 17 L. Ed. 818, 821).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That preferential right is recognized in American jurisprudence
where the rule is that the owner of the land adjacent to navigable waters has
certain riparian or littoral rights of a proprietary nature not possessed by
the general public which rights are incident to the ownership of the banks or
the uplands:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>riparian as respects the
waters of a river and littoral as to sea waters or the waters of a lake (65
C.J. S. 143-145).</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be mentioned that the Director of Lands stated in his
manifestation of October 26, 1977 that Lands Administrative Orders Nos. 7-1 and
8-3 are still in force and have not been superseded by any later regulations
and that the directive of the President of the Philippines to the Director of
Lands dated May 24, 1966, stopping the grant of foreshore leases all along
Manila Bay, towards <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>,
has not rendered the instant case moot and academic "because the foreshore
lease application involved is pending award".</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations, the trial court's
decision and the decision of the Executive Secretary dated <st1:date month="4" day="10" year="1958">April 10, 1958</st1:date> are reversed and set aside and
the order of the Undersecretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources dated <st1:date month="12" day="14" year="1954">December 14, 1954</st1:date> and the orders of
the Director of Lands dated February 1 and <st1:date month="10" day="19" year="1951">October 19, 1951</st1:date> are affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs in both instances against respondent
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Lusin</span>.</p>
