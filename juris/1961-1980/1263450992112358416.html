				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner, Municipality of San Joaquin, <span style="">seeks </span><span style="">the reversal of a decision </span>of the Court of First Instance of <span style="">Ilo­ilo </span>dismissing the former's
petition for prohibition, contest­ing the legality of Executive Order No. 436
of the President of the Philippines, dated July 10, 1961, creating the muni­cipality
of Lawigan out of twenty-one (21) barrios theretofore forming part of said
municipality of San <span style="">Joaquin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Respondents-appellees are the persons
appointed by the President as mayor, vice-mayor and councilors of <span style="">Lawigan, who are </span>sought to be re­strained
from performing their functions as such, upon the ground that Section 68 of the
Revised Administrative Code, on which said Executive Order is based,
constitutes an undue de­legation of legislative powers, and, hence,
unconstitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court,
however, held otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue herein has been squarely taken up and set­tled in
Pelaez vs. Auditor General, G. R. No. L-23825, promul­gated on December 24,
1965, which upheld the theory of appel­lant herein, and rejected the view taken
in the appealed deci­sion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, said decision is hereby reversed, and an­other
one shall be entered declaring the aforementioned Executive Order No. 436 null
and void <i style="">ab initio,</i><span style=""> </span>and directing here­in
respondents-appellees to refrain from acting as officers of the municipality of
Lawigan, with costs against them.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
