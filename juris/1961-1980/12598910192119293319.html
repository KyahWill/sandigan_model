				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Criminal Case No. 2801 of the Justice of the Peace Court of Batangas, 
Batangas, Victoriano Villanueva was accused of the crime of serious and less 
serious physical injuries with damage to property in the amount of P2,636.00 
through reckless imprudence. After the accused had pleaded "not guilty" to the 
charge and before the hearing of the case, the private prosecutor filed a 
memorandum raising the question of the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace 
court to try the case on the ground that the amount of the fine imposable upon 
the accused, aside from the penalty for the physical injuries committed, is 
beyond the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court. On the strength of 
this memorandum, the justice of the peace court issued an order on November 24, 
1958 declaring itself without jurisdiction to try the case, and forwarding it to 
the Court of First Instance for further proceedings.
<p>In the latter Court, a similar information was filed by the provincial fiscal 
against the accused. Before the arraignment of the accused, however, his counsel 
moved to quash the information on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction 
over the complex crime charged. Finding merit in the motion, the Court of First 
Instance, in an order dated January 21, 1959, declared itself without 
jurisdiction over the complex crime charged on the ground that the penalty for 
the more serious offense of physical injuries through reckless imprudence is 
only <i>arresto mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods, and even applied in 
its maximum degree (for the complex crime), it would remain within the 
jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court. It, therefore, ordered the 
return of the case to the justice of the peace for trial on the merits. From 
this order, the provincial fiscal appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>We find the appeal well-taken, for this case comes squarely under the rule 
laid down by us in Angeles, et al., <i>vs</i>. Jose, 96 Phil., 151, 50 Off. Gaz. 
No. 12, 5764, wherein we held that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'The above-quoted provision (Art. 365, par. 3, Revised Penal Code) simply 
means that if there ia only damage to property the amount fixed therein shall be 
imposed, but if there are also physical injuries there should be an additional 
penalty for the latter. The information cannot be split into two; one for the 
physical injuries and another for the damage to property, for both the injuries 
and the damage committed were caused by one single act of the defendant and 
constitute what may bo called a complex crime of physical injuries and damage to 
property. It is clear that the fine fixed by law in this case is beyond the 
jurisdiction of the municipal court and within that of the court of first 
instance.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering that it is the court of first instance that would undoubtedly 
have jurisdiction if the only offense that resulted from appellant's imprudence 
were the damage to property in the amount of P2,636.00, it would be absurd to 
hold that for the graver offense of serious and less serious physical injuries 
combined with damage to property through reckless imprudence, jurisdiction would 
lie in the justice of the peace court. The presumption is against absurdity, and 
it is the duty of the courts to interpret the law in such a way as to avoid 
absurd results. Our system of apportionment of criminal jurisdictions among the 
various trial courts proceeds on the basic theory that crimes cognizable by the 
Courts of First Instance are more serious than those triable in justice of the 
peace or municipal courts.</p>
<p>Moreover, we cannot discard the possibility that the prosecution may not be 
able to prove all the supposed offenses constituting the complex crime charged. 
Were we to hold that it is the justice of the peace court that has jurisdiction 
in this case, if later the prosecution should fail to prove the physical 
injuries aspect of the case and establish only the damage to property in the 
amount of P2,636.00, the inferior court would find itself without jurisdiction 
to impose the fine for the damage to property committed, since such line can not 
be less than the amount of the damage. Again, it is to avoid this further 
absurdity that we must hold that the jurisdiction lies in the court of first 
instance in this case.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is reversed, and the records are remanded 
to the court <i>a quo</i> for trial on the merits.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., 
Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes,</em> and 
<em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
