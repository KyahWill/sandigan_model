				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by petitioner from a resolution of the Court of
Tax Appeals, in its CTA Case No. 1450, dismissing its petition for review filed
in said court, on the ground that the same was filed beyond the 30-day period
prescribed in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue, through the Director
of <span style="">Regional District No. 3, issued a
letter </span>dated <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1961</st1:date>,
to <span style="">petitioner Filipinas Investment
&amp; Finance </span>Corporation, assessing against the latter the sum of
P5,007.00 as advance sales tax on an automobile which it purchased from a
tax-exempt individual, plus P300.00 as compromise penalty, or a total of
P5,307.00. (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 1, A, CTA rec., P. 62).</p>

<p class="BODY">Believing itself not liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
petitioner, through counsel, disputed <span style="">the
above assessment in a letter dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1961</st1:date>, and requested that the same be cancelled
and/on withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
3, B, CTA rec., pp. 64-65).</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, BIR Assistant Regional Director Toledo followed up
said assessment with a demand letter dated June 21, 19 61 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
2, C, CTA rec., p. 66), to which petitioner replied, calling the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> attention to its letter of May 15, 1961 which
contested the assessment and has not yet been acted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 3-A, D, CTA
rec., p. 68).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner denied petitioner's request for cancellation
and/or withdrawal of the assessment in a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1962</st1:date>, which was sent to
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 4, </span>E, CTA rec., pp. 71-72).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not, however, show when
petitioner received this let­ter of denial; but, in a letter dated <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="9"><u>September 28, 1962</u></st1:date>, which
respon­dent Commissioner received on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="10"><u>October
 1, 1962</u></st1:date>, petitioner reiterated its request that the said
assessment be cancelled and/or withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 8, F, CTA rec., p. 79).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the BIR record of petitioner was transmitted, on
September 24, 1962, to its Collection Branch for collection by summary remedies
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5, CTA rec., p. 73); and pursuant thereto,
Regional Director <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> sent directly to petitioner
(not to its counsel) another demand letter dated September 25, 1962, <span style="">enclosing </span>therewith a copy of the
letter of <span style="">denial </span>of August 17,
1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
6, F-1, CTA rec., p. 74).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1962</st1:date>,
petitioner answered the <span style="">above-mentioned
</span>letter, making reference to its counsel's letter of <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 7, F-2, CTA
rec., p. 75).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioner, through its counsel, further moved to reconsider the denial of its
original request for cancellation and/or withdrawal of the assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 8-A, G, CTA
rec., p. 80).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1963</st1:date>,
respondent Commissioner again denied petitioner's requests (of <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1961</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1963</st1:date>) for reconsideration
of the assessment (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>., H, CTA rec., pp. 82483);
which letter of denial, petitioner received on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="8"><u>August 12, 1963</u></st1:date>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="9"><u>September 11, 1963</u></st1:date>,
petitioner filed its petition for review in the Tax Court, disputing the
legality of the imposition of advance sales tax on the purchase and subsequent
sale of the said automobile.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1963</st1:date>,
respondent Commissioner presented, on the strength of the above-stated facts, a
motion to dismiss said petition, on the ground that the Tax Court acquired no
jurisdiction over the subject matter since the <span style="">same was filed </span>beyond the 30-day period fixed in Section 11 of
Republic Act No. 1125.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner opposed said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1964</st1:date>,
the Tax Court conducted a preliminary hearing on respondent's motion to
dismiss; and thereafter, the parties submitted their respective memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1964</st1:date>,
the Tax Court, after finding that petitioner consumed thirty-three (33) days in
filing its petition for review from the date of receipt of respondent
Commissioner's ruling on the disputed assessment, computed <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>From <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1962</st1:date>, deemed date of
receipt of</blockquote>

<blockquote>decision to <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1962</st1:date>, filing of request</blockquote>

<blockquote>for reconsideration…………. …………………. 3
days</blockquote>

<blockquote>From August 12,
19 63, date of receipt of denial of</blockquote>

<blockquote>request for
reconsideration to <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1963</st1:date>,</blockquote>

petition for review…………………. <u>30 days</u><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>T o t a l<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>–<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>33 days</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">issued its resolution, sustaining respondent
Commissioner's motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
satisfied, petitioner appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant assails the above conclusion and ruling of
the Tax Court, contending that respondent Commissioner's letter of July 23,
1963, <span style="">which </span>it received on
August 12, 1963, is the <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> decision to the
Tax Court and not respondent's letter of August <span style="">17, 1962, which is not a decision on the disputed assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, computing the period from </span><st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="8"><span style="">August
 12, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> when it
received the letter of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="7"><span style="">July 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, up to </span><st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="9"><span style="">September 11, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> when it filed its petition for review, the
same was filed exactly on the thirtieth day and well within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period prescribed in Section 11 of Republic
Act No. 1125.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed resolution should be affirmed. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It should be noted that respondent
Commissioner's letter-assessment of April 18, 1961 became a
"disputed" assessment when petitioner requested for the cancellation
and/or withdrawal of the same in its letter of May 15, 1961 (St. Stephen's
Association vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, <span style="">104 Phil., 314; that respondent's letter of August 17, 1962, denying
petitioner's request for cancellation constitutes the decision on the
"disputed" assessment, which is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Tax Court as contemplated under Sections 7 and 11 of Republic Act No.

1962 which respondent received on October 1, 1962 is a mere </span><u>pro-forma</u>
<span style="">request for reconsideration of the
letter-decision of August 17,1962 and Bid not adduce new facts or arguments and
that respondent's letter of </span>July <span style="">22,
1963 which petitioner received on August 12, 1963 is the resolution on the said
request </span>for <span style="">reconsideration
(North <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Lumber Co., Inc. vs. Collector of
Internal Revenue, G. R. No. L-12353, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's contention that the letter-decision of August 17,
1962 did not touch on its allegation in its preceding letter (of May 15, 1961)
that the automobile had passed through three previous non-tax exempt-owners before
reaching appellant's hands is not tenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Commissioner's letter aforesaid expressly declared that,
"According to the findings of our examiners, your client <u>is the first</u>
non tax exempt entity to <span style="">acquire </span>ownership
over the car in question;" and these words directly contradicted and
overruled appellant's pre­tense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the period to appeal from a decision of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue to the Tax Court under Republic Act No. 1125 is
jurisdictional and non-extendible,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and that a <span style="">taxpayer </span>may not
delay indefinitely a tax assessment by reiterating his original defenses over
and over again, without substantial variation, the Tax Court correctly
dismissed the petition for review filed by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed resolution should be, as it is
hereby, affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against
petitioner-appellant.</p>
