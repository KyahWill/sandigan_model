				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 11, 1959, petitioner Vicente F. Faustino alleging that his 
co-petitioner Justina Santos y Canon Faustino, 93 years old, was afflicted with 
several physical infirmities, bed-ridden, completely blind and all alone, was 
being exploited by one Wong Heng, who taking advantage of her condition, 
subjected her (Justina) under his control and sought to appropriate the use, 
enjoyment and ownership of her properties by fraudulent schemes, presented with 
the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, a petition for the appointment of a 
guardian over the person and properties of said Doña Justina.
<p>Pursuant thereto, Judge Natividad Almeda Lopez issued an Order authorizing 
Vicente F. Faustino to bring two reputable doctors to examine Doña Justina and 
if the examination warranted hospitalization and treatment, to take her to a 
hospital. Doctors J. Fernandez and M. Limson found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"She is very undernourished so much so that she is lacking very much 
vitamins. I recommended her transfer to a hospital. Dr. Limson was also 
agreeable to her transfer. She was brought to the Lourdes Hospital, where sho is 
now. * * *.</p>
<p>"She is completely blind due to bilateral cataract. It could be operated on, 
but she is now 92 years old and she is physically very weak. Her life would be 
endangered by an operation.</p>
<p>She cannot take care of her person, because she is too weak, and she is 
suffering from many physical diseases."</p></blockquote>
<p>She was then ordered to be confined at the Lourdes Hospital.</p>
<p>On December 1, 1951, according to Faustino, Doña Justina expressed her desire 
to be brought back to her house. Faustino filed a Motion in Court to that 
effect. Before acting on the motion, Judge Almeda Lopez, accompanied by a 
hearing officer of the Court, in the afternoon of December 9, 1959, repaired to 
the Hospital where she talked to the patient Doña Justina and the attending 
physician. At the hearing of the guardianship proceedings on December 11, 1959, 
Judge Lopez, resolving the motion of Faustino issued, in open court, an Order 
decreeing the continuation of the confinement of Doña Justina at the Lourdes 
Hospital.</p>
<p>Under date of December 21, 1959, Judge Lopez promulgated another Order, to 
wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"NOW, THEREFORE, this Court hereby appoint Ephraim Gochangco of Manila as 
special guardian over the person of Doña Justina Santos y Canon Faustino, and 
directs him to take her from the said Hospital and bring her to her residence at 
660 F. Torres, Manila, after having filed his oath of office."</p></blockquote>
<p>The patient Doña Justina signified her refusal to leave the hospital and 
expressed her desire to remain there. The Hospital Director submitted a 
Memorandum to Judge Lopez with a report of Doña Justina's doctors, describing 
her condition and expressing the opinion that the hospital was the proper place 
for her to stay. Faustino presented an alleged affidavit of Doña Justina in 
Tagalog, stating her desire to remain in the hospital and that she did not like 
Gochangco or anyone else, to be her guardian, except said Faustino. Judge Almeda 
Lopez insisted in carrying out her order and Gochangco had made known to 
Faustino that he would comply with such order.</p>
<p>Contending that the order and its execution are not only illegal but cruel, 
inhuman and criminal, Faustino, on December 24, 1959, brought the matter to this 
Court, praying for the annulment of said order and pending such annulment, for 
writ of preliminary injunction restraining the respondent Judge from enforcing 
the Order and Gochangco from complying with the same. The Writ was issued.</p>
<p>Respondent Judge Almeda Lopez filed a 30 page Answer which was subsequently 
adopted by respondent Gochangco. In their Answer, the respondents contended that 
it was within the power of the court, in guardianship proceedings, to appoint a 
Special or Temporary Guardian; that respondent Gochangco was appointed after 
respondent Judge came to know, in the hearings and investigations conducted by 
her, the cause of the conflicts and controversies in the guardianship 
proceedings over the person and properties of Doña Justina; that there are 57 
contending parties, all claiming to be relatives of the ward of Doña Justina; 
that having found that Doña Justina has no will of her own, the respondent 
decided on the necessity of appointing a neutral person as her guardian; and 
that petitioner Faustino had been charged by the other supposed relatives of 
personal and selfish motives in asking for his appointment as guardian.</p>
<p>On the same date this petition was filed with this Court, that is December 
24. 1959, respondent Judge Almeda Lopez appointed her co-respondent Ephraim 
Gochangco as <i>regular guardian</i> over the person of Doña Justina and said 
Gochangco qualified and entered into the performance of his duties as such. On 
January 7, 1960, petitioner appealed said Order (that appointing Gochangco as 
regular guardian) to the Court of Appeals (CA-G. R. No. 27584-R). The latter 
certified the same to this Court and it is now case G. R. No. L-17326.</p>
<p>In view hereof, and considering the matter of the appointment of the Special 
or temporary Guardian, which is the main object of the present petition, moot or 
academic, the same should be, as it is hereby dismissed. Without 
costs.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
