municipal board of canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Inopacan</span> proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Lapasa</span> winner, with a majority of 32 votes (1,293 to
1,261).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span>
lodged a protest (Election Case No. 24-B) in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, which rendered judgment in his favor and declared
him to be the duly elected vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Inopacan</span>,
with a plurality of twenty-four (24) votes (1,250 to 1,226).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
appealed directly to us and now alleges that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in declaring null and void Exhibits A, B,
C, and D of Precinct No. 6; Exhibits A-1 and B-1 of Precinct 12; Exhibits A, F,
G, H and J of Precinct 16; Exhibit A of Precinct 17; and Exhibits A, D, E, F,
G, and M of Precinct 18; and (2) in declaring null and void fifty (50) other
ballots in which he appears voted for, on the ground that the same are marked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On each of the eighteen
(18) ballots referred to in the first assignment of error, only the word "<span class="SpellE">Bala</span>," said </span>to be the nickname of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant, is written on the space for
vice-mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place there is
no showing that "<span class="SpellE">Bala</span>" is the nickname of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No evidence on this point is cited by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, he admits that no evidence <span class="SpellE">aliunde</span> whatsoever was presented by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the trial court said in its decision is
that the word "<span class="SpellE">Bala</span>," <u>even</u> <u>if</u>
it be considered as <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appel­lant's nickname,
is not sufficient to render the vote valid for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, after all, is a correct statement of
the rule.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 34 of the Revised
Election Code expressly provides that certificates of candidacy shall not
contain nicknames of the candidates; and section <span class="GramE">149,</span>
paragraph 9 allows the </span><span style="">use </span><span style="">of nicknames and appellations of affection
and friendship if accompanied by the name or surname of the candidate, except
when they are used as a means to identify the votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of these provisions, this Court
has held in a number of cases that for a ballot con­taining the nickname of a
candidate to be counted in his favor the nickname must be accompanied by either
his name </span>or surname, unlike a ballot which contains only the <span class="SpellE">christian</span> name or surname of a candidate, which is
considered valid if there is no other candidate with the same name or surname
for the same office (<span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Achacoso</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Protestee</span></span><span style="">-appellant invokes our decision in <span class="SpellE">Abrea</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>, 81 Phil.
809.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have heretofore explained, in <span class="SpellE">Tajanlangit</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Caseñas</span>, supra,
the reason why in that decision we considered as valid for <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> the ballots where he appeared voted for only
by his nickname "<span class="SpellE">Beloy</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We
</span><span style="">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Examining the ratio <span class="SpellE">decidendi</span> in
the case of <span class="SpellE">Abrea</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>,
supra, the reason why this Court admitted ballots containing only a nickname
was because 602 of the total number of 1,010 votes counted for <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> were cast by
writing his nickname '<span class="SpellE">Belot</span>'; and it had no
alternative than to brush aside legal technicalities for the sake of 'giving
effect to the will of the people as freely and clearly expressed in the
ballots'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In justifying the admission of
602 ballots containing the nickname '<span class="SpellE">Beloy</span>', this
Court took into consideration certain proven facts, to wit, (a) that in his
certificate of candidacy, candi­date <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> stated
that he was known by the nickname <span class="SpellE">Beloy</span>; (b) that <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> distributed sample ballots containing only his
nickname <span class="SpellE">Beloy</span> on the line for Municipal Mayor; (c)
that the ballots containing only his nickname represent 60% of the total number
of votes received by <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>; and (d) that no ob­jection
was interposed by the other party against the evidence presented by <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> that he was properly and commonly known by the
nickname <span class="SpellE">Beloy</span> and no other candidate for mayor bears
the same nickname."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">None of the circumstances mentioned in the decision just quoted
is present in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court properly rejected the 18 ballots now claimed by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now consider individually the fifty (50) ballots subject of
the second assignment of error.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precinct 6, Exhibits E
and F.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Exhibit E was rejected by
the trial court </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">marked ballot because of the word "<span class="SpellE">opalao</span>" written on space </span>6 <span style="">for councilors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word could have been intended for an
actual person, whether candidate or not, although </span><span style="">im­p</span><span style="">erfectly written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
evidence as to what it means, or that it </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">used to identify the
ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the cir­cumstances this
should be counted for <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">So should Exhibit F, which was invalidated by the trial court
because of a diagonal line drawn across the ballot, from the third to the last
space for senators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sidering that
the first two spaces are properly filled, the voter must have drawn the line to
indicate his desistance from voting for other senatorial candidates.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precinct <span style="">7, </span>Exhibits
B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, <span style="">J, K, </span>L, M, O, P and Q.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit <span style="">B </span>was
prepared by a poor writer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He </span>wrote "I. <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>"
on the space for mayor and "I. <span class="SpellE">Lapsa</span>" on
the space for vice-mayor. "I" is not the initial of <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-­appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule is that an erroneous initial of the name which accompanies the
correct surname of a candidate does not annul the vote in his favor (Section
149, paragraph 6, Revised Election Code).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a valid vote for <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-­appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>Exhibits C, D,
E, F, G and <span style="">H </span>the word "<span class="SpellE">engat</span>" appears on space 1 for senators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Exhibits I and J, the same word is written
on spaces 6 and 8 for senators, respec­tively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This word is not and could not have been intended as the name of a
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect it means "shining" or “l<span style="">uminous,"
</span>and can only be regarded as an irrelevant and impertinent
expression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is true of the word
"boy," which appears in Exhibits K, L, M, O and P on space 8 for
senators, and in Exhibit Q<span style="">, </span>on
space 6 for councilors.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact we have already ruled on these very same ballots and held
them invalid in the case of <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> vs. Court of
Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Pacito</span> <span class="SpellE">Abrea</span>,
G. R. No. L-25907, <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We there said:</p>

<blockquote>"In all of these cases, a pattern is readily discernible - a
group of voters in the same precinct wrote a particular word or name among
those voted for certain offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
unlikely that in a precinct, for ex­ample, Precinct 14, 6 voters would all
innocently write the name "Minong" or "<span class="SpellE">Menong</span>"
on line 4 for senators x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
And, this curious pattern or way of voting is true with respect to the other
ballots specified above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appearance
of the aforementioned words in practically the same spaces in several ballots,
in the same pre<span style="">cincts, is a clear and
convincing proof of a design to identify them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in a case, the appearance in 4 ballots of the name "<span class="SpellE">Cesario</span>" or "Cesar" uniformly on the first
space for senators, and of the name "Gregorio" on line 8 for senators
in 8 ballots, in the same precinct, was held to be conclusive proof that the
name of the candidate was used as a means to mark the ballots (Delgado v. <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, G.R. No. L-14143, </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="5"><span style="">May 27, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit D-<span class="SpellE">Abrea</span> is a marked

of the trial court with respect to Exhibit <span style="">G, </span>however, should be reversed, since
the words "<span class="SpellE">Mahal</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">kong</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span>" specify
nothing but affection and friendship, repeated by indication in the succeeding
vote for <span class="SpellE">Lapasa</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precinct 18, Exhibits B
and K.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Exhibit B, the
initials "A.A.D." appears on space 1 for senators.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This particular ballot
was held invalid in <span class="SpellE">Lloren</span> vs. Court of Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Pacito</span> <span class="SpellE">Abrea</span>, <u>supra</u>, where
we said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is true that under paragraph 15 of Section 149 of the
Revised Elec­tion Code, initials, while they are not valid votes, will not
invalidate the whole ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
initials referred to in said provision as not constituting valid vote must
refer to initials of re­gistered candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the appearance of these initials in 3 bal­lots in the same
precinct, on the same space, cannot be merely coincidental, but intended to
mark the ballots (<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> v. Alban, <u>supra</u>)."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Exhibit<span style=""> </span>K, “C <span class="SpellE">Pausto</span>" is
written before the name </span>of "<span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>,"
who was voted for senator on space 1 for senators, and "<span class="SpellE">Pausto</span>" appears before the name "De la
Rosa," who was also voted for senator on space 2 for senators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the space for Mayor appear the words
"<span class="SpellE">Biloy</span> <span class="SpellE">Leoren</span> <span class="SpellE">Lioren</span> <span class="SpellE">Lioren</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The use of these words before
the names "<span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>" and "De la
Rosa" cannot be considered as innocently made by the voter. "<span class="SpellE">Pausto</span>" is not the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">christian</span></span> name of candidate <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
nor of candidate De la Rosa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had it been
used only once it could conceivably be an innocent mistake, but not when used
successively, especially considering that the rest of the spaces for senators
contain only the surnames of the candidates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a con­vincing circumstance that the same was written for no
other pur­pose than to identify the ballot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Summarizing our
conclusions, we hold that fifteen (15) ballots declared invalid by the lower
court should be adjudica­ted to the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant,
namely, Exhibits E and F, Pre­cinct 6; Exhibits B, Precinct 7; Exhibits H and
I, Precinct 12; </span>Exhibits D, B-<span class="SpellE">Abrea</span>, C-<span class="SpellE">Abrea</span>, E-<span class="SpellE">Abrea</span> and F-<span class="SpellE">Abrea</span>, Precinct 13; Exhibits B and C, Precinct 16; Exhibits
B, C, and G, Pre­cinct 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Added to the
1,226 votes credited to him in the appealed decision, the total is 1,241, which
is still less by 9 votes obtained by protestant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Antonio K. <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The judgment appealed
from is affirmed, with the only modification that protestant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Antonio K. <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> is </span>declared
winner by 9 votes over <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapasa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellant.</span></p>
