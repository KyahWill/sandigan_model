				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Simeon <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> was employed as a
laborer of the Pineda furniture Store located at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Abanao</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
from 1947 until his death on <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="5">May 3,
 1965</st1:date>, with an average weekly wage of P36.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the latter date, while inside the shop of
the furniture store, and during working hours, <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>
was stabbed to death by a fellow employee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The claimant Maria P. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> is his widow
with eight minor children, all of whom were fully dependent upon him for
support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to section 30 of Act
3428 as amended, <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> Pineda, the owner of the
furniture store, obtained workmen's compensation policy DG-WC-312 from the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-appellant Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co.,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This policy was in force from May
1, 1965 to May 1, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In virtue of
this, policy, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-appellant bound itself
to a maximum liability of P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> for any one
employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policy covers, in the
language of the policy itself, "seven (7) shop workers," without
mention of names of the employees covered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The amount of P364.50 was duly paid as insurance premium.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the claim of the widow Maria P. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>,
Refe­ree <span class="SpellE">Erudito</span> E. Luna of the Regional Office No. 1
in <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City rendered a decision, declaring the
death of Simeon <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> compensable, absolving the
Pineda Furniture Store from liability, and adjudging the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
company liable to pay com­pensation benefits to the surviving dependents of
Simeon <span class="SpellE">Maliari</span> on the basis of the workmen's
compensation policy already adverted to, and ordering the respondent-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> company</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission,
and in his decision of May 19, 1967 Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>
Perez affirmed the decision of the Referee, "with the modification that
the respondent Pineda Furniture Store be ordered to pay the sum of Five Pesos
(P5.00) as postponement fee, per order dated July 8, 1966 of the Acting Referee
and Chief, Workmen's Compensation Unit, and the respondent Manila Surety &amp;
Fidelity Co., Inc. is hereby further ordered to pay to this Commission the sum
of Five Pesos (P5.00) as costs for this review, pursuant to section 55 of Act
3428, as amended." The motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> surety company was denied by the banc.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the petitioner company poses two issues, namely,
(1) Was the death of Simeon <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> compensable,
"it having been proved by competent evidence that he met his death because
of a personal quarrel between him and another employee?" and (2) Was the
death of Simeon <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> covered by the terms of the
policy it issued to the Pineda Furniture Store?</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolution of these two issues presents no special diffi­culty.</p>

<blockquote>1. Simeon <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> was stabbed to death
between <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">two o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1965</st1:date> by a co-employee, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
killing took place inside the shop of the furniture store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the stabbing which caused his
death was not brought out by the claimant, but nei­ther the employer nor the
petitioner-company proved that the killing was the result of a quarrel purely
personal in character and completely unrelated to the work of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the ab­sence of evidence to
the contrary, the death of <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> must be presumed
to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. To resolve the second issue, we need merely quote from the
decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Was Simeon <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> among
the seven (7) co-employees covered by Workmen's Compensation Commission Policy
No.</span> DG-WC-312 dated May 1, 1965? In contending that the late <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> was not covered by the policy the insurance carrier
insisted that since <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> was an employee of the Insured
assigned to the Holy Ghost Subdivision Shop and not one of those assigned at
its <span class="SpellE">Abanao</span> St. Shop, he is not among those covered by
the policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is a law
[sic] attempt to exculpate the insurance carrier from its accepted liability
under the workmen's compensation policy issued in favor of the Pineda Furniture
Shop where <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> was admittedly employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the provisions of Section 30 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, as further amended by Rep. Act No. 4119 effective
June 20, 1964, which introduced into our country the new concept of 'compulsory
insurance' in our workmen's compensation System, the insurance company which issued
a workmen's compensation policy is liable for compensation payments regardless
of conditions incorporated in the insurance policy limiting its coverage to
certain named locations, classes of employees, or specified operations, in view
of the fact that we follow the 'full coverage' rule in compulsory
insurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, if the policy
enumerates the names or number of employees covered by it, the Bureau will
disregard such enumeration or limitation when an employee, not within the list,
meets with an accident, and the bureau will require the insurance carrier to
pay compensation benefits to him as if his name were included in the list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, defenses such as non-payment of
premiums, breach of policy condi­tions, or even assignment and transfer of
interests which the insurer might have against the employer, are not available
against the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Cf.
Larson, Workmen's Compensation Law, Vol. 2, Sec. 92.00, p. 443).</span> The
philosophy underlying compulsory insurance of workmen's compensation liabilities
is to allow the injured or sick worker to receive prompt payment of his full
compensation benefits with a minimum of legal formality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it appears in the insurance
carrier's 'Schedule' that the policy apparently covers '<span class="GramE">Any</span>
person in the Insured's immediate service x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>’ which necessarily includes the late <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other interpretation will tend to defeat
the very purpose for which compulsory insurance system was introduced into the
country."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We need only add, in refutation of the petitioner-appellant's
contention that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> exceeded the
number of employees (seven in all) covered by the insurance policy, that since
the policy itself nowhere specifies the names of the persons covered, it is
obvious that Simeon <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> can­not by any reason or
rule of logic be considered as excluded from the coverage thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, at
petitioner's cost.</p>
