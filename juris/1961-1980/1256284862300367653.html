				<BR><BR><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
(5th Branch), dated June 18, 1958, as amended by the order dated June
28, 1958, dismissing the petition for mandamus to compel reinstatement
and for recovery of damages filed by herein appellants and docketed as
Special Civil Action No. 135-G. Petitioner Victor S. <span class="SpellE">Barnaba</span> has withdrawn the appeal insofar as he is concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants were employees in the city government of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leyte</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On </span><st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 5, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, according to their petition, the municipal board of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> city passed resolution No. 8 abolishing their positions for reasons of economy. On the following January 9, Acting City Mayor <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Larrazabal</span>
issued executive order No. 7 implementing said resolution and removing
appellants from their respective positions. Claiming that both the
resolution and the executive order were illegal, they instituted this
case on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 10, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The respondents were the Acting City Mayor, the Acting City Treasurer and the City Auditor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case was set for trial on the merits on March 20 and 21, 1958 before Honorable Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Debuque</span>,
the Judge then presiding. The transcript of the stenographic record of
the proceedings on March 20 shows that counsel for appellants
manifested to the court his intention to file an amended petition in
order to substitute the incumbent City Mayer, Esteban C. Conejos, for
former Acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Larrazabal</span>, and the incumbent City Treasurer for the former Acting Treasurer, as well as to include the City of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
as one of the respondents, pursuant to an intimation by the court
itself concerning the possible liability of the municipal government.
Judge <span class="SpellE">Debuque</span>, after suggesting that the
parties submit a partial stipulation of facts, with a reservation of
their right to present evidence on points that were controversial,
dictated an order giving appellants up to </span><st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 29, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> within which to file an amended petition and setting the case for new assignment on the trial calendar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For
some reason not disclosed in the record the amended petition was not
filed within the prescribed period; but on June 4, 1958 Judge <span class="SpellE">Debuque</span>
again issued an order giving appellants until June 21 to file the
amended petition, failing which the case would be tried in July 1958 on
the pleadings already submitted. Somehow the order of June 4 was
misplaced and filed with the record of another case. On or about </span><st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 16, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Judge <span class="SpellE">Numeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> took over the court of Judge <span class="SpellE">Debuque</span>, who in the meantime had been transferred to another judicial district. Two days later, or on June 18, the new Judge <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">motu</span></em></span></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></span></em>
ordered the dismissal of the petition on the ground of lack of interest
on the part of appellants to prosecute. The dismissal was without
prejudice. Appellants received copy of the order of dismissal on June
23. On June 20, however—one day before the expiration of the period
granted to them by Judge <span class="SpellE">Debuque</span> in his
order of June 4—they complied with it by filing their amended petition.
The amended petition was denied admission on June 25. Appellants moved
to reconsider, calling attention to the fact that they had been given
until June 21 to amend the petition and that they had done so within
the period, attaching to their motion a copy of the order of June 4,
and offering to prove the issuance thereof by the testimony of
witnesses and, if necessary, by the deposition of Judge <span class="SpellE">Debuque</span> himself. On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 28, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
the court denied the motion for reconsideration and amended the
previous order of dismissal by making it definite and with prejudice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The present appeal has been submitted for decision on appellants' brief alone, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> having failed to file a brief in reply. Upon the facts <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> it is clear that the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em>
committed a reversible error in dismissing the petition and in denying
appellants' motion for reconsideration. It is quite true, as stated in
the last order appealed from, that there had been considerable delay in
setting the case for trial after it was commenced as early as </span><st1:date year="1956" day="6" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 6, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.
But it is wrong to presume that such delay was caused entirely by
appellants. The record shows that the trial was set for the first time
on March 20 and 21, 1958. The Judge who then had cognizance of the case
was no doubt familiar with the reasons for its slow progress. He did
not dismiss the petition, but instead gave appellants opportunity to
amend the same, first on or before </span><st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 29, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, which they failed to do, and again up to </span><st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 21, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, which they did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The
court's order of June 28, 1958 states that when the trial set for March
20 was cancelled so as to permit appellants to file an amended
petition, the order to that effect was issued over the objection of
respondents. The record does not bear this out. No such objection was
interposed; in fact the postponement became a matter of course when the
court suggested, with the concurrence of both parties, that they submit
a partial stipulation of facts. The issuance of the order of </span><st1:date year="1958" day="4" month="6"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 4, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, giving appellants another opportunity to file an amended petition, was a matter of discretion with the court. Judge <span class="SpellE">Debuque</span>
must have found sufficient justification for his action and except for
very weighty reasons, which we do not find here, the Judge who
succeeded him should not have <span class="SpellE">interferred</span> with the exercise of such discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore, except with respect to petitioner Victor S. <span class="SpellE">Barnaba</span>,
pursuant to whose motion the appeal has been dismissed, the orders
appealed from are hereby set aside and the case remanded to the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> for further proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span></span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Regala</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span></span></em> concur.<o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
