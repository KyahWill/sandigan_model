				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A complaint for assault upon an agent of a person in authority was filed on 
September 13, 1959 by the Chief of Police of Busuanga, Palawan, against Isidro, 
Eustaquio, Teodorico, Isaias, all surnamed Daco, and Mario Edonga in the Justice 
of the Peace Court of said municipality. It alleged that on or about 11:00 p.m. 
of September 12, 1959, at sitio Bangohon, Municipality of Busuanga, province of 
Palawan, the accused, confederating with one another, wilfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously attacked Porfirio Feloteo, a policeman of said municipality, while 
in the performance of his official duty, causing him to suffer less serious 
physical injuries.
<p>After receiving the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense, 
during the preliminary investigation, the Justice of the Peace Court rendered a 
"decision" elevating the case, as against Isidro Daco, to the Court of First 
Instance, but convicting the other four accused for slight physical injuries and 
sentencing each of them to 10 days imprisonment. The "decision" notwithstanding, 
the provincal fiscal of Palawan filed an information with the Court of First 
Instance of said province charging all the five accused with assault upon an 
agent of a person in authority, with physical injuries. The defendants—except 
Isidro Daco—moved to quash the information on the ground of double jeopardy, 
alleging that the crime charged therein necessarily included the crime of slight 
physical injuries of which they had been convicted and for which they had served 
sentence.</p>
<p>The court sustained the motion to quash and dismissed the case. Hence the 
present appeal.</p>
<p>The question to be determined is whether the "decision" of the Justice of the 
Peace Court of Busuanga mentioned heretofore is valid or a nullity. If valid, 
defendants' plea of jeopardy should be sustained, but the same should be 
overruled if it is otherwise.</p>
<p>That Justice of the Peace Courts have no jurisdiction to entertain a case of 
assault against a person in authority or of assault upon an agent of a person in 
authority-except for preliminary investigation—has been repeatedly held 
heretofore. (Article 148, Revised Penal Code; Salab-salo, et al., vs. Ang Koy, 
et al., 108 Phil., 649; 58 Off. Gaz. [35] 5733; Villanueva etc. vs. Hon. Ortiz, 
et al., 108 Phil., 493; 58 Off. Gaz. [7] 1318; People vs. Romualdo, 90 Phil., 
739). As a matter of fact, the record of the present case case shows positively 
that the Justice of the Peace Court of Busuanga heard the case only to conduct 
the corresponding preliminary investigation.</p>
<p>The conviction of Eustaquio, Teodorico, Isaias, all surnamed Daco, and Mario 
Edonga by the Justice of the Peace Court of Busuanga being a nullity, their plea 
of double jeopardy can not be sustained, one of its essential elements—a 
judgment or final order rendered or issued by a competent court—not being 
present.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of dismissal appealed from is set aside and this case is 
remanded to the lower court for further proceedings in accordance with law. 
Costs de officio.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
