				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Direct appeal, on
questions </span>purely o<span style="">f </span>law, from
a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila sentencing the Manila Port
Service and the Manila Railroad Company – hereinafter referred to collecti<span style="">vely </span>as <span style="">de</span>fendants – to pay to <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> <span style="">Com</span><span style="">m</span>ercial Corporation – hereinafter referred to as <span style="">plaintiff – </span>the sum of <span style="">P428.32, </span><span style="">wi</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">h in</span>terest thereon, from October <span style="">21<span class="GramE">,196<span style="">3</span></span></span>, until fully pai<span style="">d, </span>and t<span style="">he costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the date last <span style="">mentioned,
plaintiff filed with the </span>Municipal Court of Manila a complaint against
herein <span style="">defend</span><span style="">ants for the recovery </span><span style="">of the sums of P586.19 and </span><span style="">P379.02, re</span>presenting, respectively,
the value of 16-1/3 cartons of <span style="">Royal </span>Corned
Beef, and that of 18 pieces of propeller shafts, which defendants ­­­- as <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operators for the port of Manila, unto whose
custody said goods, together with others, had been discharged by carrying
vessels - had allegedly failed to <span style="">de</span>liver
to <span style="">plaintiff, as </span>consignee of
said goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, <span style="">however, plaintiff withdrew its second cause
of action (re­lative to the propeller shafts), and, in due course, there­after,
the municipal court rendered judgment for the plain­tiff, under the first cause
of action, but for the reduced sum of </span>P428.32, <span style="">with interest thereon, at the legal rate, from the date adverted to
above, plus P50.00 as attorney's fees, and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
taken by the de­fendants, the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed said
judgment, except as regards the award for attorney's fees, which was
eliminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case is now before us
on appeal taken by the de­fendants, who maintain that plaintiff's complaint
should have been dismissed, upon the ground that the present ac­tion has not
been commenced within the period prescribed in section 15 of the Management
Contract between the defendants, which admittedly binds plaintiff herein,
reading:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in
any event the contractor shall be relieved and released of any and all respon­sibility
for loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">mis</span>-delivery, and/or non-delivery
of goods, unless suit in the court of proper jurisdiction is brought within a
period of one (1) year from the date of the discharge of the goods or from the
date when the claim for the value of such goods have been rejected or denied by
the contractor, provided that such claim shall have been filed with the
Contractor within fif­teen days from the date of discharge of the last package
from the carrying vessel x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to this section,
</span><span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">arrastre</span></span><span style=""> operator can not be sued by the consignee except within one (1) year,
either from the date of the discharge of the goods, or from the date when the
claim for the value thereof shall have been reject­ed or denied by the <span class="SpellE">arrrastre</span> operator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, the goods were discharged from the carrying vessel –
assuming, only for the purpose of argument, that this is the discharge alluded
to in the Contract – unto the custody of the operator on August 15, 1962, or
more than a year prior to the filing of the complaint, on October 21,
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plain­tiff claims, however, the
benefit of the second alternative given thereto in the above quoted section 15
of the Management Contract, namely: the right to file suit within one year from
the date when </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">claim of the consignee shall have been
rejected </span><span style="">or denied by the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">arrastre</span></span><span style=""> operator; but, the defendants argue that
this alternative cannot be availed of in the present case, because the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator has neither rejected nor denied
plaintiff's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inas­much as said
operator cannot, by inaction, deprive the con­signee of its right to the
aforementioned alternative, this Court has held</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that, when the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator fails to deny or reject the claim of the <span class="GramE">consignee</span>,
the term for the exercise of the latter's right of action shall begin to run
upon expiration of one (1) year from the date of discharge of the last package
upon the custody of said operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
date, in the case at </span>bar, was <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="8"><span style="">August 15, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, so that plain­tiff had one year from </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="8"><span style="">August
 15, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> within
which to com­mence the present action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the same was begun on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="10"><span style="">Oc­tober 21, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, it is obvious that defendants' contention
can not be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants further assail
the decision appealed from, upon the theory that 5 cartons of the shipment in
question were already damaged, or in bad order condition, when they were
discharged from the carrying vessel, and that the value of said 5 cartons should
be deducted from the award made in favor of the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be <span class="GramE">noted,</span>
however, that plaintiff's claim is predicated, <i>not</i> upon any </span><i>damage</i>
<span style="">sustain­ed by the goods consigned
thereto, but upon </span><i>non-delivery</i> <span style="">of 16-1/3 cartons of "Royal" Corned Beef.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the 5 cartons allegedly
damaged on board the carrying vessel were among those lost is a question of
fact which can not be taken up in this appeal, the same having been brought to
this Court directly from the Court of first instance "on pure questions of
law."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision appealed from should be, as it
is hereby affirmed, with costs against the defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
