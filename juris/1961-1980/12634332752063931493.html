<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> ordering defendant-appellant to indemnify the
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the total amount of Two
Hundred Thirty-Nine Thousand and Six Hundred Forty-Eight Pesos, and Seventy-Two
Centavos (P239,648.72) for injuries received in a collision caused by the gross
negligence of defendant-appellant, plus Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) as
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the amended and supplemental complaints for damages filed by
plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> against the Manila Railroad Company, now the
Philippine National Railways and duly answered by the latter and after due
hearing, the following facts appear as undisputed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the night of October 5, 1963, plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> attended a birthday party inside the United
Housing Subdivision in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the party which broke up at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11 o'clock</st1:time> that evening, the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> proceeded home in their Vauxhall car with <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> at the wheel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the railroad tracks, finding
that the level crossing bar was raised and seeing that there was no flashing
red light, and hearing no whistle from any coming train, <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
merely slackened <span style="">his </span>speed and
proceeded to cross the tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
same time, a train bound for <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> traversed the
crossing, resulting in a collision between the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impact threw the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> out of their car which was smashed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One Benjamin Franco, who came from the same
party and was driving a vehicle right behind them, rushed to their aid and
brought them to San Juan <span style="">de </span><span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Hospital for emergency treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
were transferred to the Philippine General Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A week later, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
transferred to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Doctors</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> where Dr. Manuel Rivera,
Head of the Orthopedic and Fracture Service of the Philippine General Hospital,
performed on her a second ope­ration and continued to treat her until her
discharge from the hospital on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="11">November
 2, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Dr. Rivera
treated her as an out-patient until the end of February, 1964 although by that
time the fractured bones had not yet healed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> was also operated on by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Franciso</span> Aguilar, Director of the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Orthopedic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
in May, 1964 and in August, 1965, after another operation in her upper body
from the chest to the abdomen, she was placed in cast for some three (3) months
and her right arm immobilized by reason of the cast.</p>

<p class="BODY">As enumerated in the Medical Certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"J"), Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> suffered the following:</p>

<blockquote>"(1) Fracture open middle third <span class="SpellE">humerus</span>,
right</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(2) Fracture mandible right <span class="SpellE">paramedian</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(3) Fracture fibula left
Distal</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(4) Concussion, cerebral.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(5) Abrasions, multiple
(face, head, <span class="SpellE">lumbo</span>-sacral and extremities)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(6) Lacerations (2) right
temporal</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(7) Contusions with <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> left forehead and <span class="SpellE">parieto</span>
occipital, right."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">For these injuries, she underwent a total
of four surgical operations in a period of two years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of the fracture on her right arm,
there was a shortening of about 1 cm. of that arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lost the flexibility of her wrist, elbow
and shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up to the time she took
the witness stand in August, 1966, she still had an <span class="SpellE">intermedullary</span>
nail in the bone of her right arm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
suffered brain injuries which affected his speech, memory, sense of hearing and
neck movement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a long period, he
also felt pain all over his body.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
claimed that prior to the accident he was a successful businessman - the
Special Assistant to the Dolor Lopez Enterprises, the managing partner of <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> and Rivera Partnership, the manager of his <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span>, and with substantial investments in other
business enterprises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of his
injuries, he was unable to properly attend to his various business undertakings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, his wife, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, was a skilled music and piano teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the accident, she lost the dexterity of
her fingers forcing her to quit her pro­fession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also bore ugly scars on several parts of
her body, and she suffered anxiety of a possible miscarriage being then five
(5) months pregnant at the time of the accident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense is centered on the proposition that the gross
negligence of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
was the proximate cause of the collision; that had he made a full stop before
traversing the crossing as required by section 56(a) of <span style="">Act </span>3992 (Motor Vehicle Law), he could have seen and heard the
approach of the train, and thus, there would have been no collision.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a protracted trial, the lower court rendered the decision
now subject of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant-appellant seeks the reversal of said decision; but should We
affirm the same, that the award be reduced to a reasonable amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the action is predicated on negligence, the New Civil Code<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
making clear that "whoever by act or <span style="">omission
</span>causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to
pay for the damage done," the crucial question posed in the petition at
bar is the existence of negligence on the part of defendant-appellant <span style="">as </span>found by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of
negligence being one of fact, the lower court's finding of negligence on the
part of the defendant-appellant deserves serious consideration by the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It commands great respect and
weight, the reason being that the trial judge, having the advantage of hearing
the parties testify and of observing their demeanor on the witness stand, is
better situated to make conclusions of facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it has been the standing practice of appellate courts to accord
lower court's judgments the presumption of correctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And unless it can be shown that error or
errors, substantial in character, be shown in the conclusion arrived at, or
that there was abuse in judicial scrutiny, We are bound by their
judgments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this ground alone We can
rest the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the judgment appealed from.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is the result different
even if no such presumption were indulged in, that is, even if We were to resolve
whether or not there exist compelling reasons for an ultimate reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judicial pronouncement below that the gross negligence of
defendant-appellant was the proximate cause of the collision has been
thoroughly reviewed by this Court and We fully affirm the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Negligence has been defined by Judge Cooley in his work on Torts
(3d. ed.), sec. 1324<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
as "the failure to observe for the protection of the interests of another
person that degree of care, precaution, and vigilance which the circumstances
justly demand, whereby such other person suffers injury." By such a test,
it can readily be seen that there is no hard and fast rule whereby such degree
of care and vigilance is measured; it is dependent upon the circumstances in
which a person finds himself so situated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that the law requires is that it is always incumbent upon a person
to use that care and diligence expected of reasonable men under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are the circumstances attendant to the collision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Undisputably</span>, the
warning devices installed at the railroad crossing ware manually operated;
there were only 2 shifts of guards provided for the operation there­of - one,
the 7:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. shift, and the other, the 3:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M.
shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the night of the accident, the
train for <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> was on an unscheduled trip after <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00 P.M.</st1:time> During that precise hour, the
warning devices were not operating for no one attended to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, as observed by the lower court, the
locomotive driver did not blow his whistle, thus: "xxx he simply sped on
without taking an extra precaution of blowing his whistle from a distance of 50
to 10 meters from the crossing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the
train was running at full speed is attested to by the fact that notwithstanding
the application of the emergency brakes, the train did not stop until it
reached a distance of around 100 meters."</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts assessed together show the inadequacy, nay, the
absence, of precautions taken by the defendant-appellant to warn the <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> public of the impending danger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear to Us that as the signal devices
were wholly manually-operated, there was an urgent need for a flagman or guard
to man the crossing at all times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it
was, the crossing was left unattended to after <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">eleven
 o'clock</st1:time> every night and on the night of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot in all reason justify or condone
the act of the defendant-appellant allowing the subject locomotive to travel
through the unattended crossing with inoperative signal devices, but without
sending any of its employees to operate said signal devices so <span style="">as to </span>warn oncoming motorists of the
approach of one of its locomotives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not surprising therefore that the <span class="SpellE">inoperation</span> of
the warning devices created a situation which was misunderstood by the riding
public to mean safe passage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jurisprudence recognizes that if warning devices are installed in
railroad crossings, the <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> public has the
right to rely on such warning devices to put them on their guard and take the
necessary precautions before crossing the tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A need, therefore, exists for the railroad
company to use reasonable care to keep such devices in good con­dition and in
working order, or to give notice that they are not operating, since if such a
signal is misunderstood it is a menace.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, it has been held that if a railroad company maintains a <span class="SpellE">signalling</span> device at a crossing to give warning of the
approach of a train, the failure of the device to operate is generally held to
be evidence of negligence, which maybe considered with all the circumstances of
the case in determining whether the railroad company was negligent as a matter
of fact.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The set of circumstances surrounding the collision subject of
this case is very much similar to that of <span class="SpellE"><u>Lilius</u></span><u>
v. Manila Railroad Company</u>, 59 Phil. 758 (1934), where this Court upheld
the lower court's finding of negligence on the part of defendant locomotive company
upon the following facts -</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> on
the part of the defendant company, for not having had on that occa­sion any
semaphore at the crossing at <span class="SpellE">Dayap</span>, to serve as a
warning to passersby of its existence in order that they might take the necessary
precautions before crossing the railroad; and, on the part of its employees -
the flagman and switchman, for not having remained at his post at the crossing
in question to warn passersby of the approaching train; the station master, for
failure to send the said flagman and switchman to his post on time; and the
engineer, for not having taken the necessary precautions to avoid an accident,
in view of the absence of said flagman and switchman, by slacken­ing his speed
and continuously ringing the bell and blowing the whistle before arriving at
the crossing."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendant-appellant rests its defense mainly on Section 56(a) <span style="">of </span>the Motor Vehicle Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 56(a) - Traversing through streets and railroad
crossing, etc.- All vehicles moving on the public highways shall be brought to
a full stop before traversing any 'through street' or rail­road crossing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever any such 'through street' or
crossing is so designated and signposted, it shall be unlawful for the driver
of any vehicle to fail to stop within twenty meters but not less than two and
one-half meters from such 'through street' or railroad crossing."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The defense presupposes that the failure
of plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to stop before proceeding to
traverse the crossing constitutes contributory negligence, thereby precluding
them from recovering indemnity for their injuries and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The candor of defendant-appellant in interposing such a defense
is doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As seemingly observed by
the lower court, the defense, through inadvertence or deliberateness, did not
pursue further the excepting clause of the same section, thus to go on:</p>

<blockquote>"Provided, however, that the driver of
a passenger automobile or motorcycle may, <u><span style="">instead of coming to a full stop</span></u><span style="">, </span>slow down to not more than ten kilometers per hour whenever it
is apparent that no hazard exists."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough perusal of the facts attendant to the case, this
Court is in full accord with the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> had exercised all the necessary precautions
required of him as to avoid injury to himself and to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no need for him to have made a full
stop; relying on his faculties of sight and hearing, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> had no reason to anticipate the impending
danger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> previously knew of the existence of the
railroad crossing, having stopped at the guardhouse to <span style="">ask </span>for directions before proceeding to the party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the crossing, they found the level bar
raised, no warning lights flashing nor warning bells ringing, nor whistle from
an oncoming train.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They safely traversed
the crossing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their return home, the
situation at the crossing did not in the least change, except for the absence
of the guard or flagman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on the
same impression that the crossing was safe for passage as before, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> merely <span style="">slackened
his speed and proceeded to cross the tracks, driving at the proper rate of
speed for going over railroad crossings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had defendant-appellant been successful in establishing that its locomotive
driver blew his whistle to warn motorists of his approach to compensate for the
absence of the warning signals, and that <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>, instead of stopping or slackening his speed,
proceeded with reckless speed and regardless of possible or threatened danger,
then We would have been put in doubt as to the degree of prudence exercised by
him and would have, in all probability, declared him negligent,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But as the contrary was established, We
remain convinced that <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>
had not, through his own negligence, contributed to the accident so as to deny
him damages from the defendant-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only question that
now remains to be resolved is the reasonableness of the amount awarded as
damages to the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
