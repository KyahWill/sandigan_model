<blockquote>"As gleaned from the records of the case, the Acting Referee
observed that <u>death occurred more than two (2) years from the time deceased
retired from the service of respondent</u>, hence, the death claim pursuant to
Section 8 of the Act cannot prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
also observed that the cause of death was a different illness which disabled
the deceased allegedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot invoke
the case of <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>
Mining in this claim for we observe that there is <u>no showing that deceased
was still ill of the same illness of ulcer at the time of his death</u> which
illness was allegedly the cause of his having been disabled from con­tinuing
with his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>deceased died due

been submitted</u> in support thereof where the attending physician
categorically stated that the same was due to and in pursuance of employment, a

<blockquote>"We do not find merit in the contention of the herein
representative of the claimant, for there is no showing that it was also the
said illness which caused the separation of the deceased from the service
because <u>after his operation</u> at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Mary</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Johnston</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>

the time when the deceased was still employed by the respondent, the same has
been treated and after which he returned to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He retired on </u><st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="1"><u>January 1, 1965</u></st1:date><u> and was given the

</span>We further observed that, if at all there was a relapse in the illness
of the deceased of peptic ulcer, it surfaced long after his retirement for the
same was discovered only by the attending physician <u>in 1970</u> and he retired
on <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He died on October 12 1973 due to an

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission,
herein claimant filed with this Court the instant petition for review on <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In denying the claim of claimant, the position of respondent is that
the dismissal by the Workmen's Compensation Commission of the claim of
petitioner was primarily based on its findings that the death of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> occurred
beyond the two-year period from the date of retirement provided for in Section
8 of the Compensation Act, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"If the disease contracted or injury received by the employee
as provided in section two hereof causes his death within two years from the
date of such injury or sickness, the employer shall pay the compensation to the
persons entitled thereto x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and therefore not actionable and that the
cause of his death, which is cerebral <span class="SpellE">hermorrhage</span>,
secondary to hypertension, is an entirely different disease from the disabling
sickness pursuant to Section 2 of the same Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, it is the contention of respondent that insofar
as a death claim is concerned, the illness contracted by the employee in the
course of his employment should cause his death within two years from the date
of such sickness in order that the (deceased) defendant could be entitled to
compensation, and since he stopped working with the respondent <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> Sugar Estate on January 1, 1965 and he died on
October 12, 1973 - or eight years, nine months and eleven days thereafter - due
to "cerebral hemorrhage-hypertension", petitioner's claim for death
benefits must necessarily fall.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it is claimed by the peti­tioner-claimant that
Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act does not provide that if death
occurred after two years from retirement, the next of kin is barred from filing
any claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the claimant is that Section 8 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act merely provided for the amount of compensation due the heirs
in cases where the death of an employee occurred within two years from the date
of injury or sickness, hence, said section is not applicable to the instant
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, claimant, answering
the argument of the respondents that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> had already recovered from his illness when
he was separated from the service and that he died of cerebral hemorrhage, an
illness different from the one he suffered while still an employee of <span class="SpellE">Canlubang</span> Sugar Estate, maintained that it is an undisputed
fact that the illness of the petitioner had set in during the course of his
employment and that the weight of authority is to the effect that once it is
shown that the illness supervened during employment, there is the legal
presumption that the illness arose out of or was at least aggravated in the course
of his employment and the burden shifts to the employer to overthrow by
substantial evidence such presumption, and the claimant is relieved from
proving causation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Commission that the death claim should not
prosper is well-taken since deceased died at the age of 60 on October 12, 1973,
more than two years from January 1, 1965 when the deceased was separated from
the service still afflicted with peptic ulcer and was granted P3<span class="GramE">,386.80</span> as retirement benefits, or even from 1970 when the
medical examination showed that he was still suffering from peptic ulcer.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the deceased was entitled to disability compensation
when he was separated from the service on <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1965</st1:date> by reason of his peptic ulcer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted that the deceased was
treated by the doctors of private respondent, was hospitalized and operated on
for peptic ulcer in the Mary Johnston Hospital in 1964, and retired on January
1, 1965, when he was still below 60 years of age, because of his peptic ulcer,
from which he had not fully recovered despite the operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The physician’s report of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span> dated May 15, 1973
stated that his diagnosis is that the deceased had peptic ulcer (sometimes
called stress ulcer); that "due to the nature of his employment
(mechanic), patient developed gastric hyperacidity", which resulted in
total permanent disability from his work; and that the patient had gastric
hyperacidity while working as centrifugal <span class="SpellE"><u>cargador</u></span>
and aggravated by his employment (p. 14, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1970, he still had peptic ulcer according
to the medical examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim
was filed on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since all the aforesaid events occurred before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Labor Code, all the provisions of
the Workmen's Compensation Law, as amended, as well as the decisions affirming
(1) the presumption of compensability, or presumption of work-connection or
work-aggravation, (2) waiver of non-jurisdictional defenses due to non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, and (3) the ten-year prescriptive period,
still apply to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The word "peptic" originated from the Greek word "<span class="SpellE">peptikos</span>", meaning "conducive to or pertaining to
or promoting digestion" (Medical Dictionary for Lawyers by <span class="SpellE">Maloy</span>, p. 443).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the word "ulcer" came from the Latin word "<span class="SpellE">ulcus</span>", meaning "an open sore other than a wound
that discharges pus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">It
occurs upon the surface of the skin or any of the mucous membranes"
(Medical Dictionary for Lawyers by <span class="SpellE">Maloy</span>, p. 553).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Peptic ulcer is a stomach ulcer, an
ulcer of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), or an ulcer in
the lower part of the esophagus (gullet).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An ulcer is an erosion in the skin or mucous membrane (moist lining, as
of mouth), along with some destruction of the tissue below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A stomach ulcer is such <span class="GramE">an
erosion</span> in the stomach, the inside of the stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the erosion is a little farther down, in
the duodenum (the first part of the intestine), it is a duodenal ulcer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both a stomach ulcer and a duodenal ulcer are
referred to, loosely, as a peptic ulcer, which means a digestive ulcer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A gastric ulcer is the same
as a stomach ulcer" (Attorney's Dictionary of Medicine by Schmidt, p.
757).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed from the facts of this case that the illness of
peptic ulcer of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Landicho</span>
occurred while he was still under the employ of Private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When an illness supervened in the course of
employment, there is the presumption that the same arose out of or was at least
aggravated in the course of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a settled rule in our jurisprudence that the law presumes, in the
absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that a claim is compensable,
and so rigid is the rule that even where the cause of death is unknown the
right to compensation subsists (Industrial Textile Mfg. Co. of the Phil. vs. <span class="SpellE">Florzo</span>, et al., 17 SCRA 1104, reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Vallo</span> vs. WCC, et al, 73 SCRA 623; see also Trinidad vs.
WCC, 81 SCRA 668; <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Torres vs. Warner Barnes
&amp; Co., Inc., 81 SCRA 681; Gonzales vs. WCC, 81 SCRA 703; <span class="SpellE">Cañonero</span> vs. WCC, 81 SCRA 712; Mercado vs. WCC, 81 SCRA
730; Romero vs. WCC, et al., 77 SCRA 483 and Buenaventura vs. WCC, et al., 76
SCRA 485).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also undisputed that <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> retired at the age of 60 years by reason of his
ailment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be true that after his
operation at the Mary Johnston Hospital, he was able to resume his work and
continued up to the day prior to his retirement, but this does not detract from
the fact that he had by that time been disabled because his "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ability to resume work may
only have been through his sheer determination to continue earning a living for
himself and his family x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
(Gonzales vs. WCC, 81 SCRA 703, 709).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court ruled in <span class="SpellE">Bello</span> vs. WCC (80
SCRA 153) that for purposes of the Workmen's Compensation Act, there is
disability when there is a loss or diminution of earning power which is due to
an injury arising out of and in the course of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not the injury which is compensated but
rather it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's
earning capacity (see also Roma vs. WCC, 80 SCRA 170; National Development Co.
vs. WCC, 12 SCRA 381).</p>

<p class="BODY">When an employee is forced to ask for retirement, not because of
old age, but primarily because of his weakened bodily condition due to an
illness contracted in the course of his employment, he is to be given
compensation for his inability to work during the remaining days before his
scheduled compulsory retirement, aside from the retirement benefits due him
(Roma vs. WCC, 80 SCRA 170; Hernandez vs. WCC, 14 SCRA 219).</p>

<p class="BODY">In Bautista vs. WCC (80 SCRA 313), so long as the claimant's
action had not prescribed, the Commission had jurisdiction to act on her claim
even if at the time of the filing thereof the employer-employee relationship
had terminated, for what vests jurisdiction is the fact that the illness which
caused the disability supervened and/or was aggravated during his
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
employment was coeval with the ailment, and with the two co-existing, an alleged
absence of employer-employee relationship at the time of filing the claim is
untenable as a defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in Romero vs. WCC (p. 489, <u>supra</u>), cited in
Gonzales vs. WCC (p. 709, <u>supra</u>), quoting <span class="SpellE">Inton</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Morabe's</span> the Workmen's Compensation Act (1955
ed., p. 76) -</p>

<blockquote>"Disability, as a basis for compensation, is the combination
of partial or total physical incapacity and of inability to work, or inability
to work with the same ease and competency as before the injury, or the loss,
total or partial, of earning power from the injury (Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>,
Sec. 535, p. 813).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Disability is used either in the <u>medical or physical sense</u>,
as evidenced by obvious loss of members or by medical testimony that the
claimant simply cannot make the necessary muscular movements and exertions; it
is also used to mean <u>de facto inability to earn wages</u>, as evidenced by
proof that claimant has not in fact earned anything.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"These medical and wage-loss aspects of disability may be more
clearly illustrated as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
claimant may be, in a medical sense, utterly shattered and ruined, but by mere
sheer determination and ingenuity contrive to make a living for himself;
conversely, a claimant may be able to work, in both his and the doctor's
opinion, but awareness of his injury may lead employers to refuse him employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The problem of the administrators of the Act is the proper
balancing of these medical and wage-loss factors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An absolute insistence on medical disability
in the abstract would produce a denial of compensation in the latter case,
although the wage-loss is as real and as directly traceable to the injury as in
any other instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the other
extreme, an insistence on wage-loss as the test would deprive the claimant in
the former illustration of an award, thus not only penalizing his laudable
efforts to make the best of his misfortune but also fostering the absurdity of
pronouncing a man non-disabled in spite of the unanimous contrary evidence of
medical experts and of common observation (Larson, p. 3, Vol. II)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> vs. WCC (72 SCRA 454, 458),
the Courts ruling that since the petitioner was forced to retire from the
service due to his disability to continue with his work with private
respondent, he should be entitled to disability compensation benefits authorized
by the Workmen's Compensation Act for persons suffering from permanent
disability (Sec. 14, WCA).</p>

<p class="BODY">Other authoritative comments on the coverage of the term
"permanent total disability" as used in the Workmen's Compensation
Act, are (a) Comments and Annotations on the Workmen's Compensation Act by <span class="SpellE">Severo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Pucan</span> and Cornelio R. <span class="SpellE">Besinga</span>, that "total disability does not mean a state
of absolute helplessness, but means disablement of an employee to earn wages in
the same kind of work, or a work of similar nature, that he was trained for or
accustomed to perform, or any kind of work which a person of his mentality and
attainments could do"; (b) Philippine Labor and Social Legislation by
Justice <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> Martin, that "permanent total
disability means disablement of an employee to earn wages in the same kind of
work, or work of a similar nature that he was trained for, or accustomed to
perform, or any other kind of work which a person of his mentality and
attainment could do x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"; and (c) Labor
Standards and Welfare Legislation by Perfecto Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quiason</span> that "permanent total disability means
an incapacity to perform gainful work which is expected to be permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This status does not require condition of
complete helplessness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it
affected by the performance of occasional odd jobs" (cited in <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> vs. Seven-Up Bottling Co. of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
47 SCRA 343).</p>

<p class="BODY">In Jacob vs. WCC, et al. (72 SCRA 575), the illness of petitioner
caused her to apply for retirement a year before her retirement age and the
gravity of her illness was such that it totally disabled her from work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court ruled that she was entitled to the
maximum amount of Six Thousand (P6,000.00) Pesos as disability compensation
under Section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent should have <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
the claim from the time it had knowledge of the illness of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Landicho</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent cannot deny having knowledge thereof (a) since
deceased was examined by its company physicians (b) it knew of deceased's

may have triggered the onset or exacerbation of their ulcer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experimentally, ulcers can be produced in
