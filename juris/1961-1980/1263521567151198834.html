				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appellant Francisco D. Santana was sued by plaintiff, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Company, along with the
other defendants, Jose Maria <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> and Maria Paz
<span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span>, his son-in-law and his daughter, for the
recovery of the sum of money due in an overdraft agreement, with the <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> couple as principal debtors and appellant as
surety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment went against him
notwithstanding his plea based on Article 2080 of the Civil Code, releasing
guarantors, even if they be <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>, if by some act
of the creditor subrogation is thereby precluded.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court, presided by the then Judge, now Justice of the Court of
Appeals, Jose N. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>, in a well-written
decision, found such a defense untenable as in what was characterized by the
lower court as the "contract of absolute guaranty", appellant had
waived his rights to the benefit conferred by such a provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, he would vigorously contend
that what was thus agreed to by him was bereft of a binding force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law in its wisdom does not lend its
approval to such an ill-disguised attempt to turn one's back to an obligation
arising from a valid contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
to affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision, now on appeal, after stating the nature of the
action which as noted is for the recovery of a sum of money due on an overdraft
agreement set forth the undisputed facts thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"On September 9, 1963, plaintiff and defendants executed a contract
denominated 'overdraft agreement and pledge' wherein the plaintiff granted to
the spouses Jose Maria <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> and Maria Paz <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> an overdraft from time to time on their current
account with the plaintiff bank not to exceed P200,000.00, with interest at the
rate of 9% per annum until September 10, 1964,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * *, the proceeds of which were to be used by the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
in their logging operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
Francisco D. Santana, as guarantor, and the spouses <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>,
conveyed to the bank shares of capital stock of the International Sports
Development Corporation as collateral security for the payment of any and all
indebtedness incurred or arising from the overdraft, and all extensions,
renewals, amendments or applications thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, defendant Francisco D. Santana executed a document
denominated as absolute guaranty in which, in consideration of the 'overdraft
agreement and pledge', he bound himself to the bank, jointly and severally,
with the <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> spouses for the full and prompt
payment of all the indebtedness incurred or to be incurred by said spouses on
account of the overdraft line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1964</st1:date>, Jose Maria <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> wrote to the plaintiff bank [a] letter, * * *,
requesting renewal of the overdraft agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff bank, in a letter dated September 21, 1964, * * * granted the <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> spouses an extension of the overdraft line for
six (6) months from September 10, 1964, but reducing the overdraft line to
P185,000.00 with the understanding that other terms and conditions of the
overdraft agreement would be in full force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the expiration of the six (6) months
period, or on March 5, 1965, Jose Maria <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span>
asked for another renewal of the overdraft line for another year, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, this letter was granted by the
plaintiff on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1965</st1:date>,
for in another letter of Jose Maria <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> to the
bank, * * * the defendant, on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="3">March
 29, 1965</st1:date>, assured the bank that he would comply with the
requirements of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
letter dated May 11, 1965, * * * of the bank to <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span>,
the Manager of the Credit Department advised Jose Maria <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span>
that the Board of Directors of the plaintiff bank approved his request for an
extension of the overdraft line in the amount of P185,000.00 for another year,
or until March 10, 1965, but with interest at the rate of 10% per annum; that
in the same meeting, the Board also approved the release of the pledge of 135
shares of stocks of the Inter­national Sports Development Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants failed to pay the indebtedness
on the date due and demand for payment was made upon Francisco Santana and <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> as per letters dated December 14, 1965, January
24, 1966 and March 4, 1966, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of
<st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1966</st1:date>, the
total amount due from the defendants, including interests, was P219,165.18, * *
*."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision went on to state:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
<span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span> spouses failed to answer the complaint and
were declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
Santana does not dispute the indebtedness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it is his contention that he had been released from the
guaranty for several reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
Santana contends that he was released from his obligation on the overdraft line
because the plaintiff had extended the time of payment and released to the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> without his consent, the 135 shares of stocks
of the International Sports Development Corporation which had been pledged to
the bank to secure the overdraft line.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is argued that, in accordance with Article 2080 of the New Civil
Code, 'The guarantors, even though they be <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>,
are released from their obligation whenever by some act of the creditor they
cannot be subrogated to the rights, mortgages <u>and</u> preferences of the
latter.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why such a contention was held devoid of merit was explained in
such decision thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The contract
of absolute guaranty, * * *, expressly authorized the plaintiff bank to extend
the time of payment and to release or surrender any security or part thereof
held by it without notice to, or the consent of, Santana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had consented in advance to the release of
the guaranty which the bank might make, Santana cannot now complain that the release
of the pledge was without his consent, and that it deprived him of the right to
be subrogated to the rights of the creditor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The waiver is not contrary to law, nor is it contrary to public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not prohibit the
debtor-guarantor from agreeing in advance and without notice to the release of
any security which had been given to assure payment of the obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waiver is not contrary to public policy,
because the right is purely personal, and does not affect public interest nor
does it violate any public policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither does the return of the shares of stocks <span class="SpellE">novate</span>
the original contract for the obligation remains the same; and if it is a <span class="SpellE">novation</span>, it is a <span class="SpellE">novation</span> made
with the consent of Santana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the pledge is merely an accessory obli­gation, and its release does not vary
the terms of the principal obli­gation."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed decision speaks for itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot, as was made plain in the opening
paragraph of this opinion, be overturned.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is thus obvious that the contract of absolute guaranty
executed by appellant Santana is the measure of his rights and duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is with him, so it is with the
plaintiff bank. What was therein stipulated had to be complied with by both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could appellant have any valid cause for
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had given his word; he
must live up to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the validity of
its terms is conceded, he cannot be indulged in his unilateral determination to
disregard his commitment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A promise to
which the law accords binding force must be fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is as simple as that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the Civil Code explicitly requires:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Obligations arising from contracts have
the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in
good faith."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. It could have been different if there were no such contract of
absolute guaranty to which appellant was a party under the aforesaid Article
2080.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have been freed from the
obligation as a<i> </i>result of plaintiff releasing to the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
without his consent the 135 shares of the Inter­national Sports Development
Corporation pledged to plaintiff bank to secure the overdraft line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For thereby subrogation became
meaningless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a provision is
intended for the benefit of a surety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was a right he could avail of.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is not precluded however from waiving it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was what appellant did precisely when he
agreed to the contract of absolute guaranty. Again the law is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A right may be waived unless it would be
contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> There
is no occasion here for the exceptions coming into play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been traditional in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for parents to extend all available aid and assistance to their children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a custom of long standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there anything offensive to morals by
an assumption of contingent liability as thus worded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law has not been thwarted. Neither is
public order nor public policy disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court was right therefore in yielding full assent to the
waiver in question.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The vigor with which counsel for appellant impugned the lower court decision
cannot therefore be attended with success.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It can stand its ground notwithstanding such a sustained and spirited
attack.</p>
