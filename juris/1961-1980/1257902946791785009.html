<p>The <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Laoag</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE"> 
,</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, brought this appeal to this 
Court from a decision of the <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte Court of 
First Instance which held a tax ordinance of the municipality null and void and 
ordered it to refund to the <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte Electric Co., 
Inc. the amount of P1,200 paid by the latter under the ordinance. </p>
<p>The ruling was made in a suit filed by the electric power company. The lower 
court found that the company was granted a municipal franchise (Resolution No. 
308), pursuant to Act No. 667 in relation to Act Nos. 1022, 3636 and 3108, to 
operate an electric plant within the municipality. Under Act No. 3636, the 
company paid a tax equal to 2 per cent of its gross earnings "in lieu of any and 
all taxes."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> </p>
<p>On <st1:date month="9" day="29" year="1960">September 29, <span class="GramE">1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> ,</span> however, the 
municipality enacted Ordinance No. 20, series of 1960 imposing an annual rate 
tax of P800 on persons engaged in the business of supplying electricity. By 
January, 1962, the company had paid under protest to the municipality the amount 
of P1<span class="GramE">,200</span>. </p>
<p>The company contended that the ordinance impaired the obligations of its 
contract, <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> considering that under 
Act No. 3636, as well as under its franchise, it was exempted from the payment 
of any tax other than that provided therein. On the other hand, the municipality 
asserted its power to tax on the basis of the Local Autonomy Act of 1959 (Rep. 
Act No. 2264), section 2 of which provides in part as follows: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all chartered cities, 
municipalities and municipal districts shall have authority to impose municipal 
license taxes or fees upon persons engaged in any occupation or business, or 
exercising privileges in chartered cities, municipalities or municipal districts 
by requiring them to secure licenses at rates fixed by the municipal board or 
city council of the city, the municipal council of the municipality, or the 
municipal district; xxx Provided, however. That no city, municipality or 
municipal district may levy or impose any of the following: </p>
<p>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </p>
<p>“(d) Taxes on persons operating waterworks, Irrigation and other public 
utilities except electric light, heat and power; </p>
<p>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </p>
<p>“(j) Taxes of any kind on banks, insurance companies, and persons paying 
franchise tax; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The lower court sustained the company's stand and held the ordinance null and 
void, prompting the municipality to bring this appeal to this Court. </p>
<p>The question, troublesome for some time because of the new orientation 
introduced by the Local Autonomy Act, was recently resolved in <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> Sawmill, Inc. v. City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Butuan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> .</span> G. R. No. L-21516, <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1966">April 29, 1966</st1:date>. Through Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, this 
Court held that local governments are without power to tax electric power 
companies already subject to franchise tax unless their franchise allows the 
imposition of additional tax. It said: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"The argument of the appellant city is that, under subparagraph (d) of the 
above-quoted provision, the business of electric light, heat and power, being an 
exception to those which it cannot tax like waterworks and irrigation is within 
the city's taxing power. This argument is untenable, because (1) sub-paragraph 
G) of the same section specifically withholds the imposition of taxes on persons 
paying franchise tax (like <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein), and (2) 
the city’s interpretation of the provision would result in double taxation 
against the business of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> because the 
internal revenue code already imposes a franchise tax. The logical construction 
of section 2(d) of Republic Act No. 2264 that would not nullify section 2(j) of 
the same Act is that the local government may only tax electric light and power 
utilities that are not subject to franchise taxes, unless the franchise itself 
authorizes additional taxation by cities or municipalities. </p></blockquote>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed without costs. </p>
