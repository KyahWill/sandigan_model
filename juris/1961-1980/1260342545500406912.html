				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by plaintiffs Florencio, Pedro, Aniana and Maria Deudor, hereinafter 
referred to as appellants, from certain orders of the Court of First Instance of 
Rizal dated February 28, 1957 and January 10, 1958.
<p>Prior to March 16, 1953, J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., and Gregorio Araneta 
&amp; Co., Inc., as alleged owners and attorneys-in-fact of Santa Mesa Heights 
Subdivision, were involved in Civil Cases Nos. Q-135, Q-139, Q-174, Q-177 and 
Q-187 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal. In Case No. Q-135, entitled 
"Florencio Deudor, et al. <i>vs</i>. J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc., et al.", 
plaintiffs therein, invoking title under an alleged "informacion posesoria", 
claimed a parcel of land of about 50 "quiñones", or 225 hectares, located in 
Tatalon, Quezon City, over which J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. asserted ownership 
under the Land Registration Act, by virtue of an original certificate of title, 
covering a bigger tract of land, issued way back in 1914. The title of J. M. 
Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. over portions of said 50 "quiñones" was, also contested 
in said Civil Cases Nos. Q-139, entitled "J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. 
<i>vs</i>. Agustin de Torres", Q-174, entitled "Apolonio Misericordia <i>vs</i>. 
J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc.," Q-177, entitled "Agripino Pascual <i>vs</i>. J. 
M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc.," and Q-186, entitled "Macaria Fulgencio <i>vs</i>. J. 
M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc." On March 16, 1953, these five (5) cases were settled 
by a compromise agreement between J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio 
Araneta &amp; Co., Inc., on the one hand, hereinafter referred to as the 
appellees, and all of the other parties in said cases, who were designated in 
said agreement, and will hereinafter be referred to collectively as the 
Deudors.</p>
<p>It appears that prior to the institution of said cases, the Deudors had 
caused the aforementioned land of about 50 "quiñones" to be subdivided into lots 
and that some of these lots, aggregating approximately 30 "quiñones", were sold 
to several persons, whose names are set forth in two lists attached, as Annexes 
B and C, to said compromise agreement. The Duedors, including appellants herein, 
acknowledged therein the title, in fee simple, of J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., 
Inc.,—who is referred to in the agreement as Owners—in and to said land of 50 
"quiñones", and renounced, ceded and quit-claimed in its favor whatever right, 
title or interest they (the Deudors) had over said property, and, in 
consideration thereof, J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. undertook to pay them 
P1,201,063, from which the aggregate sum of P486,137.26 would be deducted for 
certain purposes stated in the agreement, thereby leaving a balance of 
P714,295.74, to be paid in the manner and under the conditions set forth in 
clause 8, section <i>d</i>, of the Compromise Agreement, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The first payment shall be P100,000.00 and shall.be made within sixty (60) 
days from the date the decision rendered in the foregoing cases approving this 
compromise agreement becomes final; Provided, that within said period the 
DEUDORS shall have effected the delivery to the OWNERS of at least 20 quiñones, 
the possessory rights over which have not been sold by the DEUDORS to third 
persons, out of the total area of 50 quiñones involved herein in such manner 
that the OWNERS, may without interruption, proceed with the subdivision and sale 
of said 20 quiñones and likewise deliver the portions so sold to the buyers 
thereof, and provided further, that if the DEUDORS FAIL TO DELIVER said 20 
quiñones as above, specified, then the first payment of P100,000.00 mentioned in 
this paragraph shall not be made until after the delivery is effected;</p>
<p>"2. If the DEUDORS, within a period of 60 days from the date of decision 
rendered in the foregoing cases, should be able to deliver the peaceful and 
complete possession of the portion of the property occupied and possessed by the 
persons listed in Annex 'C' and who are not willing to continue with their 
contracts of purchase and such other persons who may later join the ones listed 
in said Annex 'C', the payments subsequent to that specified in the paragraph 
immediately preceding shall be made as follows:</p>

<p>It was further stipulated in the agreement that "it shall be the joint and 
solidary obligation of the Deudors to make the buyers of the lots purportedly 
sold by them to recognize the title of the <i>owners</i> over the property 
purportedly bought by them and to make them sign, whenever possible new 
contracts of purchase for said property at the current prices and terms 
specified by the <i>owners</i> in their sales of lots known as 'Sta. Mesa 
Heights Subdivision'"; that "the possession of the land in question shall be 
turned over by the Deudors to the owners as herein provided and the former shall 
guarantee that during the pendency of the sale of said property, no squatters or 
unauthorized persons shall settle or take possession or continue in possession 
of any portion of said property"; and that in the event of failure of the 
Deudors to comply with any of the obligations and conditions of the agreement, 
the owners shall have the right to suspend the payments aforementioned.</p>
<p>This compromise agreement was submitted for approval to the Court, which, 
after assuring itself that the parties understood the contents thereof, caused 
the agreement to be signed in Court, and then rendered on April 10, 1953, a 
decision the last two (2) paragraphs of which read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The parties and their respective attorneys have petitioned this Court that 
after rendition of judgment in the above-antitled cases, steps be taken, under 
the supervision of this Court, to implement said 'Compromise Agreement', and in 
the interest of justice the Court grants this last mentioned petition. It should 
be understood, however, that the implementation to be taken under the 
supervision of the Court will not and should not be construed and interpreted by 
the parties that it shall in any way affect this decision on the merits rendered 
by the Court.</p>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, <i>decision</i> is hereby rendered declaring, 
as it hereby is declared, that J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. is the absolute 
owner of the land involved in these cases, having in its name a transfer 
certificate of title issued in accordance with the provisions of the Land 
Registration Act, said title being binding and conclusive against the whole 
world. It is further ordered that the 'Compromise Agreement' be, as it hereby 
is, approved in its entirety and all the parties to the same are hereby enjoined 
to abide and comply faithfully and strictly with the terms and conditions set 
forth in the said 'Compromise Agreement'. No pronouncement as to 
costs".</p></blockquote>
<p>The portion of 20 "quiñones", mentioned in clause 8, section <i>d</i>, 
subsection (1), was not delivered by the Deudors until January 14, 1956, and 
this was made possible only because the appellees had agreed to and did advance 
certain sums to defray the expenses necessary therefor. On April 6, 1956, the 
Deudors filed a motion praying that the appellees be required to pay them the 
balance of the agreed first installment—after deducting said advance—or the sum 
of P79,800.00. On or about April 13, 1956, the appellees deposited this amount 
in Court and at the same time filed a "motion and counter-manifestation" 
inviting attention to the constructions existing on the undelivered portion of 
30 "quiñones" and praying that the Deudors be ordered to remove such 
constructions—regardless of whether the same existed on March 16, 1953, when the 
Compromise Agreement was entered into, or were made after said date—within 
fifteen (15) days, as well as "to comply strictly with their obligation to 
maintain the status quo, with respect to said undelivered portion of 30 
'quiñones' and to hold the reliable for such damage as may result from their 
having granted permission to make additional constructions herein after March 
16, 1953".</p>
<p>Soon later, or on April 27, 1956, the appellees filed a supplemental motion 
and "manifestation" praying that payment of said sum of P79,800.00 to the 
Deudors "be withheld until after the additional 129 illegal constructions in the 
30 'quiñones' area shall have been removed".</p>
<p>Subsequently, J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. filed another motion and 
"manifestation", dated August 8, 1956, to the effect that the number of illegal 
constructions on said area had increased to 165, that, meanwhile, several 
alleged purchasers from the Deudors, not mentioned in the annexes attached to 
the Compromise Agreement, had instituted Civil Cases Nos. Q-1889 and Q-1890 of 
the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, against the Deudors and the 
appellees, and that, in consequence of such cases, the amounts payable to the 
Deudors from the appellees may not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of the 
plaintiffs in said cases, and praying, therefore, that appellees' aforementioned 
"motion and counter-manifestation" and "supplemental motion and manifestation" 
of April 13 and 27, 1956, be resolved and that the sum of P79,800.00 be retained 
to answer for the claims of the alleged purchasers not yet mentioned in Annexes 
B and C of the Compromise Agreement.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on February 28, 1957, the Court issued an order, pertinent parts 
of which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The attention of this Court has been called by the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., 
Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. to the fact that the illegal constructions on 
the 30 quiñones, which constructions were made from and after the date of the 
Compromise Agreement, are growing in number, and that as of January 8, 1957 
these constructions totalled 215. Whether these constructions were made with the 
Deudor's permission as claimed by the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio 
Araneta, Inc. or without the Deudors' consent as claimed by Atty. Laurel is of 
no memant. What is material and pertinent now is that these houses and the 
continued constructions of houses appear completely unabated, and unless this is 
stopped by those who are supposed to be in possession of the land, these very 
houses within the 30 quiñones will afford very formidable stumbling blocks 
against further implementation of the Compromise Agreement. Under the Compromise 
Agreement, and subject to its other terms and conditions, those referred to 
collectively as the 'Deudors' are obligated, and they have so bound themselves, 
to deliver the clear and peaceful possession of the entire 50 quiñones to the 
OWNERS, J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and/or their ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT FOR SANTA 
MESA HEIGHTS SUBDIVISION, Gregorio Araneta, Inc.</p>
<p>"Under paragraph 3 of the Compromise Agreement, those referred to 
collectively as the 'Deudors' claimed to have been in possession of the land, 
and pursuant to par. 9 of the same Compromise Agreement, the 'Deudors' bound 
themselves to deliver possession of the land in question over to the Owners. It 
is, therefore, clear to this Court that unless the construction of houses is 
abated in some way, the implementation of the Compromise Agreement can never be 
effected. The J. M. Tuason.&amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. have asked 
this Court to set a period of 15 days within which the 'Deudors' would deliver 
the possession of the remaining 30 quiñones unto said companies. The impatience 
of the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. is 
understandable, considering that it is almost four years since the decision 
became final and yet the 'Deudors' have utterly failed to deliver the 30 
quiñones. The Compromise Agreement does not state any specified period within 
which the 'Deudors' have to definitely comply with, their obligations, but in 
accordance with Article 1197 of the new Civil Code this Court is authorized and 
empowered to set a period within which they shall fulfill and comply with all 
their obligations. This Court is of the opinion that a period of four (4) months 
from date hereof is more than ample time within which the 'Deudors' may comply 
with their obligations under the Compromise Agreement, having in mind that more 
than 42 months have elapsed before the 20 quiñones were in fact delivered, and 
mostly through the effort of the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio 
Araneta, Inc. The Court has also in mind that the Compromise Agreement 
contemplated 60 days from date thereof for compliance therewith by the parties, 
and certainly the 60-day period so set could not reasonably be extended to four 
years. The Court would like to call the attention of the parties to the fact 
that in its decision dated April 10, 1953 the parties were 'enjoined to abide by 
and comply faithfully and strictly with the terms and conditions set forth in 
the Compromise Agreement.' Up to the present time, there does not appear to by 
any sincere or effective steps taken by any of those referred to collectively as 
the 'Deudors' in implementing the Compromise Agreement. The Court, therefore, 
hereby sets a period of four (4) months within which the 'Deudors' shall deliver 
possession of the entire 30 quiñones to the J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and 
Gregorio Araneta, Inc. Failure of the 'Deudors' to so deliver will have the 
effect of freeing the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and the Gregorio Araneta, 
Inc. from all its obligations under the Compromise Agreement and judgment, and 
the latter shall thereafter be entitled to possession of the 30 quiñones thru 
this Court's process.</p>
<p>"Counsel for the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. have 
also called the attention of this Court to the effect that there seem to be 
other persons who have allegedly bought lands from the 'Deudors' and who have 
submitted the corresponding Deeds of Sale to this Court but whose names have not 
been included in the lists submitted by the 'Deudors' to the attorneys of the J. 
M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and attached to the Compromise Agreement as Annexes 
'B' and 'C'. The Court likewise takes cognizance of the fact that there are 
presently pending cases wherein persons have filed complaints praying that the 
difference in the price fixed by the Gregorio Araneta, Inc. for the same land 
should be charged against or deducted from whatever amount the 'Deudors' would 
receive from the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc.</p>
<p>"This Court believes that it cannot decide the question now, but shall do so 
in cases properly brought up before it. It likewise takes cognizance of Civil 
Cases Nos. Q-1732, Q-1733, Q-1746, Q-1799, and Q-1932 filed against the Deudors 
and J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc., and other related 
cases. As to those persons who had allegedly bought land from the Deudors but 
whose names have not been included in the lists, Annexes 'B' and 'C' to the 
Compromise Agreement, the Court cannot at the present time issue an order 
without a proper motion from the proper party.</p>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, * * *.</p>
<p>"Those referred to collectively as the 'Deudors' in the Compromise Agreement, 
namely, Florencio Deudor, Maria Deudor, Pedro Deudor, Aniana Deudor, Jesus 
Gamitan, Cirilo del Rosario, Tomas de la Cruz, Rufina Guerrero. Ana Pascual, 
Alberta Martinez. Ambrosio Andaya, Donato Fajardo, Eustaquio.Alquiros, Agripino 
Pascual, Macaria Fulgencio, Carlos Javier, Aurea Misericordia and Feliciano 
Misericordia, are hereby ordered to clear and deliver the peaceful possession of 
the 30 quiñones to the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc., 
within a period of four (4) months from date hereof, except such constructions 
by those persons who are mentioned in the Compromise Agreement as willing to 
continue in the purchase of the parcel of land which they may be occupying and 
who are willing to pay the price set by the Gregorio Araneta, Inc. Failure on 
the part of the persons named in this paragraph to comply with said order, the 
Court shall issue such writs, orders and processes as may be necessary to place 
the J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. in possession of the 
said 30 quiñones."</p></blockquote>
<p>On April 4, 1957, the Deudors filed a motion for reconsideration, stating 
that their failure to make delivery of the 30 "quiñones" was not due to their 
fault; that the period of four (4) months given them in the order of February 
28, 1957, for the delivery of said portion, is too short; that the pendency of 
the other cases mentioned in appellees' motion and manifestation dated August 8, 
1956, rendered the aforementioned order premature; and that the Deudors are 
themselves entitled to an order directed to the Sheriff for the delivery to the 
appellees of the litigated property, and praying that said order of February 28, 
1957, be so modified as to delete therefrom all references to the four-month 
period for the delivery of the 30 "quiñones" and to appellees' discharge from 
their obligations under the compromise agreement, and that the Sheriff be 
ordered "to clear the premises of said 30 'quiñones' of all persons unlawfully 
squatting on or occupying the same or portions thereof".</p>
<p>Gregorio Araneta, Inc. in turn, filed a motion, dated August 16, 1957, 
alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Deudors had not delivered the 
aforementioned portion of 30 "quiñones", despite the expiration of the period of 
four (4) months, fixed in the order of February 28, 1957, and that, owing to the 
failure of the Deudors to make said delivery, the construction of houses by 
squatters within said area had continued so unabated that, as of August 12, 
1957, there were 341 constructions therein, and praying that an order be issued 
directing the Sheriff of Quezon City to place the appellees "in possession of 
the 30 'quiñones' subject to these cases now in the possession" of the Deudors, 
who were named individually in said motion.</p>
<p>On January 9, 1958, appellants herein filed a "manifestation" in which they 
offered to deliver to the appellees those portions of the 30 "quiñones" on which 
there are no actual occupants or squatters, as well as to cooperate with the 
appellees in pin-pointing the unoccupied and clear areas which they are ready to 
deliver and to join the appellees in the filing of appropriate suits for the 
ejectment of all persons unlawfully occupying portions of the remaining thirty 
(30) "quiñones" and/or handling negotiations directed to the same end.</p>
<p>By an order, dated January 10, 1958, the lower court denied the motion for 
reconsideration of the Deudors and granted said motion of Gregorio Araneta, Inc. 
dated August 16, 1957. This order was amended by another one, dated January 21, 
1958, which suspended the resolution of said motion of Gregorio Araneta, Inc., 
in compliance with a writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of 
Appeals.</p>
<p>Appellants maintain that the orders of February 28, 1957 and January 10, 
1958, are erroneous, upon the ground that: (1) the lower court had no authority, 
either to fix a period of four (4) months for the delivery of the thirty (30) 
"quiñones" in question, or to declare that the appellees would be free from 
their obligations under the Compromise Agreement, should the Deudors fail to 
make delivery within said period; (2) the lower court's lack of authority to 
decide in this case the issues raised in cases Q-1732, Q-1733, Q-1746, Q-1799 
and Q-1932 thereof, as stated in its order of February 28, 1957, shows that the 
same was premature, insofar as it fixed the aforementioned period and stated the 
effect of the failure to make delivery within the same; (3) neither did the 
lower court had authority, after the expiration of said period, to set aside the 
Compromise Agreement, to the extent that it remained unimplemented or executory, 
and to release the appellees from further obligations under said agreement; and 
(4) although the lower court held the appellees entitled to a process for the 
delivery of the 30 "quiñones" to them, it denied appellants' petition for such 
process in favor of the same appellees.</p>
<p>With respect to the period fixed by the lower court for the delivery of said 
30 "quiñones" and the effect of the failure to deliver the same within said 
period, it is urged that the order of February 28, 1957, amounted to an 
amendment of the Compromise Agreement, without the consent of the parties 
therein, and of the decision of April 10, 1953, long after the same had become 
final and executory. There is no merit in this pretense. Appellants admit that 
the Compromise Agreement "failed to prove for a specific period within which the 
Deudors should deliver possession" of said 30 "quiñones". Upon the other hand, 
it is clear from the nature of said agreement and the circumstances surrounding 
the same that a period was intended by the parties thereto. Indeed, considering 
that the appellees had a Torrens title, they had no reason to agree on paying 
P614,925.74 to the Deudors, except upon the expectation of delivery of said area 
without unreasonable delay. Accordingly, said agreement is subject to the 
principle set forth in Article 1197 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, 
reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the obligation does not fix a period, but from its nature and the 
circumstances it can be inferred that a period was intended, the courts may fix 
the duration thereof.</p>
<p>"The courts shall also fix the duration of the period when it depends upon 
the will of the debtor.</p>
<p>"In every case, the courts shall determine such period as may under the 
circumstances have been probably contemplated by the parties. Once fixed by the 
courts, the period cannot be changed by them."</p></blockquote>
<p>When the authority granted by this provision is exercised by courts, the same 
do <i>not</i> amend or modify the obligation concerned. Article 1197 in <i>part 
and parcel</i> of all obligations contemplated therein. Hence, whenever a period 
in fixed pursuant to said Article, the court merely <i>enforces or carries 
out</i> an <i>implied</i> stipulation in the contract in question. In fact, 
insofar as contracts not fixing a period are concerned, said legal provision 
applies only if, from the nature and circumstances surrounding the contract 
involved, "it can be inferred that a period was <i>intended</i>" <i>by the 
parties</i> thereto. For this reason, the last paragraph of Article 1197, 
ordains that "in every case, the courts shall determine such period as may under 
the circumstances have been probably <i>contemplated by the parties</i>". In 
other words, in fixing said period, the court merely <i>ascertains</i> the 
<i>will of the parties</i> and <i>gives effect</i> thereto.</p>
<p>Neither does the order of February 28, 1957, amount to an amendment of the 
decision of April 10, 1953, for the same approved the Compromise Agreement <i>in 
toto</i> and enjoined the parties "to abide and comply faithfully with the terms 
and conditions" thereof. Thus, the agreement became, for all intents and 
purposes, incorporated in the decision, and acquired the same force and effect 
as the latter. And this is why appellants contend that the order of February 28, 
1957 constitutes an amendment of the <i>decision</i> of April 10, 1953. However, 
this conclusion of the appellants is legally untenable, for, as pointed out 
above, Article 1197 of our Civil Code is part of the Compromise Agreement, and 
consequently, of said decision, so that the application of said Article involved 
merely the enforcement of an implied stipulation of the parties to said 
agreement, and, accordingly, of an <i>implied provision of the decision 
itself</i>. As a matter of fact, said decision explicitly declares that "the 
parties and their respective attorneys have petitioned this Court that after 
rendition of judgment * * * steps be taken * * * to implement the 'Compromise 
Agreement'" and that "in the interest of justice the Court grants this 
petition".</p>
<p>The Deudors insist that, as stated by the lower court in its order of 
February 28, 1957, It could not decide in this case the issues rated by a number 
of claimants, not named in Annexes B and C of the Compromise Agreement, who had 
instituted, against the herein appellees and appellants, civil actions other 
than those settled by said agreement, and that being thus aware that appellants 
cannot deliver the 30 "quiñones" in question on account of said new civil 
actions, the lower court still required them to make said delivery under penalty 
of forfeiting the right to collect P614,925.74. Thus appellants would seem to 
imply that the lower court had imposed upon them an obligation which is 
impossible of compliance because of "legal obstacles" to its performance.</p>
<p>The obligation to deliver said 30 "quiñones" arose, however, from the fact 
that appellees were owners thereof and from the promise made by the Deudors in 
the Compromise Agreement, not from the order of February 28, 1957. Moreover, the 
period within which delivery was to be made, sprang from the same agreement, as 
implemented by the court, pursuant to said Article 1197, which, impliedly, is 
part of the agreement. Again, appellants represented therein that they were in 
possession of the land and in a position to make delivery thereof, Indeed, 
otherwise, appellees would not have undertaken to pay P614,925.74 to the 
Deudors. Appellees' right to said delivery was not conditioned upon appellants' 
actual ability to make such delivery. Hence, the existence of other parties who, 
by instituting judicial proceedings, had put legal obstacles to said delivery, 
did not affect appellants' obligation to make it under the Compromise Agreement. 
In fact, in clause 9 thereof, they <i>guaranteed</i> "that during the pendency 
of the sale" of the property in question, "no squatters or unauthorized persons 
shall settle or take possession of any portion of said property * * *. In other 
words, appellants had assumed the risk concomitant with possible incursions, by 
squatters or other unauthorized persons, into the aforementioned property.</p>
<p>It is next urged, that in case of appellants' failure to comply with any of 
their obligations under the Compromise Agreement, the appellees, pursuant to 
clause 14 thereof, had only the right to suspend the stipulated payments. It 
should be noted, however that appellees would have the obligation to pay 
P614,925.74 only "<i>if</i> the Deudors * * * should be able to deliver the 
peaceful and complete possession" of the.30 "quiñones" in question. Until 
delivery thereof, appellants had <i>no</i> right, therefore, to said sum, and 
accordingly, appellees had <i>no</i> obligation to pay it. Since, admittedly, 
said 30 "quiñones" have not been delivered, it follows that there is no occasion 
for the suspension of appellees' obligation to pay, for they had no such 
obligation as yet. The stipulation about suspension of payments referred to 
non-compliance by appellants of their obligations under the agreement 
<i>other</i> than the delivery of the 30 "quiñones", for such delivery was a 
suspensive condition upon the fulfillment of which the <i>acquisition of the 
right</i> of the Deudors to said P614,925.74, and the effectiveness of the 
obligation of the appellees to pay it, depended.</p>
<p>Because, the order of January 10, 1958, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be noted that under the agreement, the 'Deudors' are supposed to 
make delivery of the area unconditionally. In fact, in several of the 
conferences preceding the execution on the final compromise agreement, the 
registered owners of the land made it clear that they were agreeing to the 
settlement only because they wanted to obtain early possession of the whole 
property and the 'Deudors' through their counsels warranted that such possession 
would be with J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. in a 
matter of months or, at most, in a year. There is no excuse, therefore, for the 
failure of the 'Deudors' to deliver the remaining 30 quiñones 4 years and 8 
months after the execution and approval of the compromise agreement. The 
equitable, if not the legal, solution of the problem is the setting aside of the 
compromise agreement of March 16, 1953 so far as it still remains unimplemented 
or executory. The failure to deliver and the continued mushrooming of houses in 
the area, despite the compromise, justify the release of J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., 
Inc., and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. from further obligations under the agreement of 
March 16, 1953."</p></blockquote>
<p>appellants assert that it was improper for the lower court, in the 
proceedings for the enforcement of its decision of April 10, 1953, to set aside 
the Compromise Agreement, insofar as it still remained unimplemented or 
executory, and to release the appellees from further obligations under said 
agreement. The above-quoted paragraph of said order of January 10, 1958, was, 
however, a mere exposition of some of the reasons why the lower court granted 
appellees' motion of August 16, 1957, and denied the motion for reconsideration 
filed by appellants on April 4, 1957. In any event, said paragraph is but a 
faithful statement of the law pertinent to the subject, inasmuch as the period 
of four (4) months, given to the Deudors, in said decision, for the delivery of 
the land of 30 "quiñones"—to which their right to collect P614,925.74 was 
subject as a suspensive condition—constituted a resolutory period. When the same 
expired with said suspensive condition still unfulfilled, appellants' right to 
comply with it was extinguished, and the conditional obligation of the appellees 
to pay said sum was terminated (Article 1193, Civil Code of the 
Philippines).</p>
<p>With respect to appellants' claim to the effect that they offered to deliver 
"portions" of the land of 30 "quiñones" "on which there are no actual occupants 
or squatters at present," suffice it to note that, under clause 8, section d, 
subsection 2 of the Compromise Agreement, the appellees are bound to pay 
P614,925.74 only "if the Deudors * * * should be able to deliver the peaceful 
and <i>complete</i> possession" of said land of 30 "quiñones". In short, 
delivery of a portion thereof would not suffice for the acquisition by 
appellants of the right to collect said sum or any part thereof. The parties 
clearly contemplated a full, not partial, fulfillment of said condition.</p>
<p>Lastly, appellants say that they have as much right as appellees herein to 
the execution of the decision herein, and yet the lower court granted the 
latter's motion for a writ of execution thereof and denied a motion of the 
former to the same effect. It is not true, however, that the two (2) motions 
were identical. Appellees prayed that an order be issued directing the Sheriff 
of Quezon City "to place them in possession of the 30 'quiñones' subject to 
these cases, <i>now in the possession of" appellants</i>, whereas, appellant's 
motion was to the effect that an order be issued "commanding the Sheriff to 
clear the premises of the 30 'quiñones' <i>from all persons unlawfully 
squatting</i> on or occupying the same or portions thereof." It was proper for 
the lower court to grant appellees' motion, because the process therein sought 
was directed <i>against appellants</i> who are bound by the decision of April 
10, 1953. It would have been improper for the lower court to grant appellants1 
aforementioned motion, since the same sought to affect <i>squatters</i>, who are 
neither parties in this proceeding nor bound by the aforementioned decision, 
and, hence, are beyond the jurisdiction of the court in this case.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders appealed from are hereby affirmed, with costs against 
herein appellants, Florencio, Maria, Aniana and Pedro, all surnamed Deudor. It 
is so ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
