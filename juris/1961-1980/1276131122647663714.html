				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, Hon. 
Guillermo S. Santos, presiding, in CAR Case No, 371 and CAR Case No. 368.</p>
<p align="center">CAR Case No. 371</p>
<p>The facts necessary to an understanding of this case (No. 371) are as 
follows: Camilo Pangan and Sotera Santiago, spouses, are the tenants of a parcel 
of land of three hectares, more or less, in the barrios of San Isidro and Santo 
Rosario, Paombong, Bulacan, belonging to Leonila Tiongson. Two hectares of the 
land is planted to palay, while the remaining one hectare is devoted to other 
crops, Camilo Pangan cultivated the land under the share tenancy system. Camilo 
Pangan was a tenant since 1917. In December, 1959, Pangan filed a petition 
demanding a change in the sharing arrangement from 50 to 70-30 in his favor. 
Respondent, on February 17, 1960, filed a motion to dismiss the case alleging 
that she had sold the land subject of the tenancy on September 8, 1958 to Monico 
Cruz, who, therefore, succeeded her in all the obligations over the 
landholding.</p>
<p align="center">CAR Case No. 368</p>
<p>In CAR Case No, 368 Monico Cruz filed a petition on December 11, 1959 against 
Camilo Pangan alleging that he has purchased the land tenanted by Pangan from 
Leonila Tiongson; that he has notified Pangan of his intention to personally 
cultivate the land but Pangan refused to accede to his request that he be 
allowed to cultivate the land.</p>
<p>The above two cases were heard jointly and after trial the court entered 
judgment, which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(4) Granting MONICO CRUZ authority to eject tenant CAMILO PANGAN from the 
land in question, subject to the provision of Sec. 22 pars. (3) and (4), RA 
1199, as amended, and to the further condition that should the landholder-owner 
petitioner MONICO CRUZ fail to cultivate the land him-self personally for at 
least three (3) years after dispossession of tenant PANGAN, it shall be presumed 
that he acted in bad faith and the latter, shall, upon proper petition, be 
reinstated in the holding with the corresponding damages for any loss incurred 
by him because of said dispossession (Sec. 50 (a)in relation to Sec. 22, pars. 
(3) and (4), RA 1199, as amended) ;"</p></blockquote>
<p>The above decision was rendered on January 6, 1062.On March 31, 19'52, upon 
motion, the court set aside the above judgment. The findings of fact made by the 
court in the original decision are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears that the amount paid for the land in question was realized from 
the sale of Monico Cruz's holding at Lugam, Malolos, Bulacan which was sold for 
the amount of THIRTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO AND NINETY FIVE CENTAVOS 
(P13,622.95) to the spouses Delfin Franco and Leoniza Agustin (Exh. 'D'). The 
sale of the land in question by Leonila Tiongson to Monico Cruz is evidenced by 
a deed of sale and the holding is duly registered in the latter’s name (Exhs 'A' 
&amp; 'A-l'). The holding was sold upon sufficient consideration—224,225. sq. m. 
for THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE PESOS and TWENTY CENTAVOS 
(P113,499.20). The Deed of Sale between the parties and the registry of the 
holding in Monico Cruz's name are presumed to be regular (Sec. 69 (l) &amp; (2), 
Rule 123, Rules of Court). While Pangan's application of the tenancy law to 
their relation may have been the reason for the sale of the disputed holding by 
Tiongzon to Monico Cruz, we cannot believe—in the absence of convincing 
proofs--that Tiongson simulated the sale to Cruz, who is also her tenant, merely 
to eject Pangan from the holding. It is true that the subject holding is located 
on the middle of a larger tract of agricultural land owned by Tiongson, but the 
owner has the right to choose which portion of the property to sell. Pangan 
purchased the subject holding instead of the l/2 hectare tumana worked by him, 
because the same is located in the vicinity of his residence, is bigger in area 
than the tumana and is planted to palay. We, therefore, do not find sufficient 
evidence to show that the sale registration of the land were fraudulent 
transactions solely to effect tenant Pangan's ejectment. It is incumbent upon 
tenant Pangan to prove that these are fraudulent subterfuges to dispossess him 
of the holding due to his demand for a lawful sharing basis. This, he failed to 
do."</p></blockquote>
<p>In reconsidering the above findings of fact and changing the decision the 
court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Certain tell-tale circumstance of this case would tend to show that the 
former owner, Leonila Tiongson, and petitioner, Cruz, in effecting the transfer 
of ownership of the landholding contrived to effect the ejectment of respondent 
Pangan. It appears that the former owner, Leonila Tiongson, told respondent 
Pangan that she would eject him from the landholding after respondent Pangan 
sought the application of the 70-30 sharing basis with her; that the land was 
sold to petitioner after respondent sought the proper application of the 70-30 
sharing basis between them; that the payment for the consideration of the Lugam 
property—even assuming that there was actual monetary consideration—was made in 
the house of said Leonila Tiongson: that the landholding in question is located 
in the middle—or nearly so--of the 22-hectare, more or less, holding owned by 
Leonila Tiongson ; that apart from respondent, no petition for the proper 
sharing by the other tenants on the landholding against the former owner has 
been filed; and, finally, that the consideration paid by petitioner Cruz for the 
landholding in question is P13,499.20 as against its assessed value of 
P11,560.00, while the purchase price of the Lugam property which petitioner Cruz 
acquired from Rosa Reyes Tantoco--a relative of Leonila Tiongson—was P12,463.55 
as against its assessed valued of only P2,830.00. These circumstances taken in 
consideration with the respondent's witnessess' testimonies point to the design 
of petitioner and the former landowner to effect respondent's ejectment, by 
petitioner, himself a tenant of the former owner, Leonila Tiongson—who 
personally-being a woman—could not have filed, this action. This being so, the 
intention of petitioner to cultivate the holding cannot be <u>bona fide</u>. It is 
tainted with <u>mala fide</u> and, therefore, should not be granted."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the above considerations, the court re-considered its previous 
decision authorizing Monico Cruz to cultivate the land himself, and, reversing 
its former stand denying the petition of Pangan for a change in the tenancy 
system in the land of Leonila Tiongson, declared that he was entitled to such a 
change from a sharing basis to that of 70-30. In arriving at the above 
conclusions the court below found that the purchase by Monico Cruz of the 
property tenanted by Pangan was tainted with bad faith, that Monico Cruz in 
purchasing the land had conspired with Leonila Tiongson to deprive Pangan of the 
tenancy of the land. We are not prepared to hold that the circumstances given by 
the court to justify its conclusion of the existence of bad faith on the part of 
Monico Cruz are not sufficient in substance to sustain that conclusion. The 
court saw the witnesses testify and the above is its conclusion from their 
testimonies and of the circumstances. That, the three-hectare land is in the 
middle of a 22-hectare parcel makes the sale, if not improbable, at least 
suspicious. In any case, We are without authority to set aside the find in that 
the purchase of the property of Tiongson by Monico Cruz was tainted with bad 
faith, there being special reasons justifying the conclusion. In view of Our 
inability to review this finding of fact, which appears sufficiently justified 
by the circumstances. We find no reason or ground for disturbing the decision 
sought to be reviewed and We, therefore, affirm it. Without costs. So 
ordered.</p>
