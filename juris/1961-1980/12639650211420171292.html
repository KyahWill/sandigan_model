				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by accused Rafael Marco from the judgment of the Court of 
First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur in Criminal Case No. 2757, entitled <em>People of the Philippines versus Rafael Marco, Dulcisimo Beltran and Simeon Marco</em>, the dispositive part of which reads thus:
<blockquote>
  <p>"WHEREFORE, the Court renders judgment as follows: </p>
  <p>(1)  In Criminal Case No. 2757, the Court finds Rafael Marco, 
Dulcisimo Beltran, and Simeon Marco, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
the crime of Murder, qualified by abuse of superior strength; and hereby
 sentences Rafael Marco, who has neither aggravating circumstance 
against him or any mitigating circumstance in his favor, to <em>RECLUSION PERPETUA</em>.
  Simeon Marco and Dulcisimo Beltran, who surrendered voluntarily, are 
hereby sentenced EACH to an indeterminate penalty consisting of TEN (10)
 YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS, and ONE (1) DAY of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum.
  </p>
  <p>"The Court further sentences the three defendants to pay, jointly 
and severally, to the heirs of Bienvenido Sabelbero, the amount of 
P6,000.00, to suffer the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay the 
costs." (Page 69, Record.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, there were two cases filed against appellant in connection 
with two successive phases of a single occurrence.  The two cases were 
consolidated and tried together.  In Criminal Case No. 2757, he was 
charged together with his son Simeon and one Dulcisimo Beltran with the 
alleged murder of one Bienvenido Sabelbero.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 In Criminal Case 2758, he was charged together also with his son Simeon
 with frustrated murder allegedly committed against Constancio 
Sabelbero, a brother of Bienvenido.  In this second case, herein 
appellant was found guilty only of slight physical injuries and 
sentenced to twelve (12) days of <em>arresto menor</em>.  He did not appeal.  Simeon was acquitted.
</p><p>The incident in question took place on November 5, 1964 at about 
2:30 o'clock in the afternoon within the vicinity of the market place of
 Barrio Subang, Pagadian, Zamboanga del Sur.  There was a fiesta being 
celebrated, but it was raining.  The details, according to the evidence,
 were as follows:
</p><p>Constancio Sabelbero was approached by Simeon Marco who asked him
 if he was the one who boxed the latter's brother the previous year.  
Constancio denied.  Then Simeon asked if he had cigarettes and when he 
said he had none, Simeon said, "I have cigarettes; here is my 
cigarette", as he pulled out a one-foot long hunting knife.  Frightened,
 Constancio ran away and Simeon chased him.  As Constancio was passing 
by the place where appellant Rafael Marco, the father of Simeon, was 
standing, Rafael struck Constancio with a round cane, hitting him on the
 left ear and left shoulder.  This was the basis of the information in 
Criminal Case No. 2758, where appellant was convicted of slight physical
 injuries and his son, Simeon, was acquitted.
</p><p>Vicente, the father of Constancio, happened to be standing in the
 crowd and heard shouts of "Fight! Fight!" He saw Simeon about to stab 
Constancio, so he grabbed the hand of Simeon that was holding the knife.
</p><p>At this juncture, Rafael Marco approached Vicente armed with a 
cane and a hunting knife.  Sensing danger, Vicente shouted to his son 
Constancio, who had been hit by Rafael, and his other son Bienvenido, 
who appeared on the scene, to run away because the Marcos were armed.  
Constancio was able to run away.  So also Vicente.  Bienvenido who was 
being chased by Rafael was stabbed by the latter, and when he parried 
the blow, he was wounded on the left hand.  After being stabbed by 
Rafael, Bienvenido still tried to run farther, but unluckily, his foot 
got caught in a vine on the ground and he fell, whereupon, out of 
nowhere, Dulcisimo Beltran, who was accused with herein appellant and 
who did not appeal his conviction, arrived and stabbed Bienvenido near 
his anus while he was in the position described in the record thus 
"(Witness demonstrating with his two hands touching the floor and his 
both feet (sic) in a forward position)".  (p. 24, t.s.n.) Beltran was 
followed by Simeon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> who 
stabbed Bienvenido on the left breast and the upper part of the left 
arm.  Afterwards, Rafael, Simeon and Beltran ran away. "Bienvenido 
Sabelbero stood up slowly and walked zigzagly towards the store of Pinda
 and when he arrived in front of the store, he fell to the ground." (p. 
27, t. s. n.)
</p><p>When Vicente came to know that his son Bienvenido was wounded, he
 went to the store of Pinda and found him lying there.  Vicente asked 
him what happened, "Bienvenido Sebelvero answered that he was wounded 
because he was ganged up by them and immediately after that he died." 
(p. 28, t.s.n.)
</p><p>For the purposes of this appeal, the foregoing facts We have 
gathered from the recorded evidence and which coincide substantially 
with the findings and basis of the appealed decision are more or less 
admitted by appellant in the brief of his counsel de oficio to be the 
more credible version of what happened.  Nevertheless, counsel has 
assigned seven alleged errors of the trial court, although the whole 
thrust of this appeal revolves around the issue of whether or not with 
what has been proven, as narrated above, to be the participation of 
appellant in the phase of the incident that led to the death of 
Bienvenido, said appellant, Rafael Marco, may be held liable for murder,
 as found by the court below.
</p><p>It will be recalled that the whole incident was started by Simeon
 Marco, the son of Rafael, who approached Constancio and after asking 
him if he was the one who boxed his (Simeon's) brother the year before, 
brandished a hunting knife, which caused Constancio to run away.  While 
thus running, he passed by appellant who hit him with a round cane.  
Such was the first phase of the incident subject of this case. According
 to the trial court for such act of Rafael, he was guilty of slight 
physical injuries, since "it is safe to assume that at that moment there
 was no intent to kill any one."
</p><p>As to the second phase, according to the evidence, when Simeon 
was about to pursue Constancio, Vicente grabbed Simeon's hand that was 
holding the knife.  But when Vicente saw that Rafael, who was holding a 
round cane and a hunting knife, was approaching them, he shouted to 
Constancio and to his other son Bienvenido who was around to run away, 
which they did, as he himself released Simeon and ran away.  Rafael 
followed Bienvenido and stabbed him, but the latter parried the blow 
with his left hand.  And as Bienvenido was trying to run farther, 
unluckily, his feet got entangled with some vines and he fell down.  
Whereupon, Beltran, who came from nowhere, stabbed him near the anus, 
followed by Simeon who stabbed him on the left side of the breast.
</p><p>Upon these facts, the People maintain that appellant is as guilty
 as Simeon and Beltran of the killing of Bienvenido, the theory being 
that there was obvious conspiracy among them.
</p><p>The trouble with the evidence of the prosecution is that it is 
vague and incomplete.  For instance, as to the first phase of the 
incident, the relative positions and distances from each other of the 
three protagonists, Simeon, Constancio and Rafael are not revealed.  How
 far Rafael was from Simeon and Constancio when Simeon sort of 
threatened him with a knife is not clear.  Neither is it shown how 
Rafael happened to be in the path of Constancio when the latter was 
running away from Simeon, such that Rafael was able to hit him with a 
cane.  In this situation, We do not feel safe in concluding that there 
was concerted connection between the act of Simeon, on the one hand, and
 that of Rafael, on the other.  Thus, the trial court was correct in 
acquitting Simeon and holding Rafael guilty only of slight physical 
injuries instead of frustrated murder as charged.
</p><p>Likewise, in regard to the second phase of the incident, We are 
at a loss as to what Bienvenido was actually doing and what 
participation he had at the early stages of the incident, when Vicente 
shouted to him to run away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The pertinent portion of testimony of the lone eye-witness, Dominador Carbajosa, is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Q   Then what happened? <br>

stood up slowly and walked zigzagly towards the store of Pineda and when
 he arrived in front of the store he fell down to the ground.
  </p>
  <p>(Pp. 23-27, t. s. n.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nearest indication of Bienvenido's position vis-a-vis those of 
the Marcos and Beltran at the moment that Vicente was holding the hand 
of Simeon appears only in the cross-examination of Garbajosa, when he 
said that "Bienvenido Sabelvero was nearer to the three accused" than 
either Vicente or Constancio, which makes the whole matter more 
confusing.
</p><p>As matters stand, Our problem is to determine whether or not the 
act of Rafael in stabbing Bienvenido is a separate one from the stabbing
 of said deceased by the two other accused who did not appeal, Simeon 
Marco and Dulcisimo Beltran.  To be sure, the acts of each of the three 
of them followed one after the other in rather fast succession, as if 
propelled by a common and concerted design, but this circumstance alone 
does not prove criminal conspiracy.  In order that mere simultaneity or 
near simultaneity of the acts of several accused may justify the 
conclusion that they had conspired together, the inference must be 
ineludible.
</p><p>It would seem that there must have been some bad blood between 
the Sabelberos and the Marcos but Vicente categorically denied that 
there was any misunderstanding between them and although Constancio 
suggested that there was, he was quick in adding that the same had been 
patched up.  This makes commonality of intent on the part of the three 
accused not necessarily existent.
</p><p>As already stated, Simeon and Beltran did not appeal from the 
decision of the trial court which Credited them with the mitigating 
circumstance of voluntary surrender and imposed on them the penalty of 
only Ten (10) Years and One (1) Day of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to Seventeen (17) Years, Four (4) Months and One (1) Day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>
 as maximum.  And indeed there can be no doubt as to the homicidal 
character of their assault on Bienvenido.  In the case of herein 
appellant, while it is true that he somehow started the aggression by 
trying to stab Bienvenido, and did cause him injury on the left hand, 
there is no clear evidence connecting his act with those of Beltran and 
Simeon.  As We have noted earlier, Beltran came out of nowhere and it is
 not shown that Rafael saw him before the latter stabbed Bienvenido near
 the anus.  On the other hand, the most that We can gather from 
Carbajosa's testimony is that Simeon was being held by Vicente, when 
Rafael tried to chase Bienvenido.  In any event, if Rafael had any 
intention to really kill Bienvenido, he did not have to await for Simeon
 and Beltran to do it.  Bienvenido had fallen to the ground, and that 
was the chance to finish with him.  But here is precisely where the 
prosecution's evidence is incomplete.  The distance and relative 
position of Rafael from where Bienvenido fell are not indicated.  What 
appears instead is that Beltran and Simeon were the ones who stabbed him
 fatally.  What Rafael did or where he was after Bienvenido fell and 
while Beltran and Simeon were assaulting has not been shown.
</p><p>We find the following ratiocination of appellant's counsel <em>de oficio</em> to be well taken:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"2.  <i>The evidence on record does not show beyond reasonable doubt 
that appellant acted in conspiracy with the two other accused in the 
actual killing of the decedent.</i> </p>
  <p>"This Honorable Court has established the rule that conspiracy, 
although implied or indirect, must, nonetheless, be positively and 
convincingly proved and established (<i>People vs. Aplegido</i>, 76 Phil. 571).
  Only recently, this Honorable Tribunal said, through the pen of Mr. 
Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"x x x As a facile device by which an accused may be ensnared and kept within the penal fold, <em>conspiracy
 requires conclusive proof if we are to maintain in full strength the 
substance of the  time-honored principle of criminal law requiring proof
 beyond reasonable doubt before conviction</em>.  x x x" (<em>People vs. Tividad</em>, L-21469, June 30, 1967; 20 SCRA 549, 554; italics supplied). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court also laid down the following norm in the said case of People vs. Tividad:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"x x x It is indubitably clear from the record that the accused did
 not attack the deceased simultaneously.  Even if they did, this would 
not of itself indicate the existence of a conspiracy among them as 
simultaneity per se is not a badge of conspiracy, absent the requisite 
concurrence of wills.  It is not sufficient that the attack is joint and
 simultaneous; it is necessary that the assailants are animated by one 
and the same purpose (<em>U.S. vs. Magcomot</em>, 13 Phil. 386, 389; <em>People vs. Caballero</em>, 53 Phil. 584, 595-596).  <em>Evidently,
 in a situation where the assaults were not simultaneous but successive,
 greater proof is demanded to establish concert of criminal design</em>.
  The evidence for the prosecution shows that the assaults on the 
deceased were carried out by the accused successively." (Id., pp. 
554-555; italics supplied) </p>
  <p>"As happened in the Tividad case, the facts established by the 
evidence here show that appellant did not attack the decedent 
simultaneously and in concert with the two other accused.  From the 
testimony of Dominador Carbajosa, it will be seen that:  (1) <em>It was the appellant who went after the decedent first</em>.
  And the situation at that moment was this:  Simeon Marco was chasing 
Constancio Sebelbero while appellant, on the other hand, was approaching
 Vicente Sebelbero.  The latter had just shouted to his two sons to run 
away when the appellant overtook the decedent and stabbed at him.  
Accused Dulcisimo Beltran, it will be noted, was not yet a participant. 
 (2) After the appellant wounded the decedent on the hand, the latter 
continued running.  <em>There is no evidence however that appellant continued running after him.  </em>(3) While running, the decedent tripped and fell down<em>.  Accused Dulcisimo Beltran just came from nowhere and stabbed the decedent near the anus</em>.
  It will be noted that from the time appellant wounded the decedent on 
the hand up to the time Dulcisimo Beltran stabbed him at the back, an 
appreciable length of time lapsed.  There is no evidence just how far 
Dulcisimo Beltran was from the decedent when the latter fell.  Neither 
is there evidence that the decedent was running in the direction of 
Dulcisimo Beltran.  The evidence is only that Dulcisimo Beltran came 
upon the decedent who had fallen to the ground and immediately stabbed 
him.  (4) <em>After Dulcisimo Beltran had stabbed the decedent, Simeon 
Marco, who earlier had been chasing Constancio Sebelbero, came also and 
stabbed the decedent</em>.  From Dominador Carbajosa's testimony, it 
appears that there was no appreciable lapse of time between the stabbing
 by Dulcisimo Beltran and that by Simeon Marco.  (5) There is no showing
 that appellant joined his two other accused during or immediately after
 their stabbing of the decedent.  Carbajosa merely stated that after the
 stabbing, "they ran away" (Session of Sept. 13, 1965; t. s. n., p. 27).
 </p>
  <p>"From all the foregoing, this Honorable Court will see that the 
stabbing of the decedent by the three accused (including appellant) was 
not simultaneous.  Rather, it was successive, with appellant inflicting 
the first blow.  And, Dulcisimo Beltran and Simeon Marco were nowhere 
around yet.  It was only after the decedent fell down that the latter 
two came and successively stabbed him.  The manner in which the incident
 occurred indicates that there was no pre-conceived plan among the three
 accused to kill the decedent.  It strongly suggests, on the other hand,
 that Dulcisimo Beltran and Simeon Marco participated suddenly, 
unexpectedly and without any previous agreement. </p>
  <p>"Another interesting point to observe is that there is absolutely 
no showing that appellant knew of the criminal intentions of Dulcisimo 
Beltran or Simeon Marco as to the decedent.  There is no proof that 
appellant chased the decedent in the direction of Simeon Marco or 
Dulcisimo Beltran.  It was not even shown that appellant knew that 
Dulcisimo Beltran was around at the start.  As to Simeon Marco, it will 
be remembered that when appellant started after the decedent, Simeon 
Marco was running after Constancio Sebelbero.  Hence, appellant could 
not have <em>intentionally</em> chased the decedent in the direction of 
Simeon Marco.  Besides, as previously pointed out already, there is no 
evidence showing that appellant ran after or chased the decedent at all.
  Dominador Carbajosa said only that appellant overtook the decedent who
 was just nearby and then stabbed at him (Session of Sept. 13, 1965; 
t.s.n., p. 23).  Likewise, there is no evidence that after the decedent 
ran again, the appellant continued going after him. </p>
  <p>"Neither is there any showing that after the decedent was able to 
run away from the appellant with only a slight wound on the hand, the 
latter shouted to Dulcisimo Beltran or Simeon Marco for assistance.  As 
the facts were related by the star prosecution witness, Dulcisimo 
Beltran and Simeon Marco just came upon the fallen decedent and stabbed 
him.  <em>There is no showing that Dulcisimo Beltran and Simeon Marco 
fell upon the decedent in response to shouts or cries from the appellant</em>.
  Lastly, there is no proof that while Simeon Marco and Dulcisimo 
Beltran were stabbing the decedent, appellant gave them any inciting or 
encouraging words, or that he even joined them. </p>
  <p>"The point appellant wants to establish with all the foregoing 
considerations is that the prosecution utterly failed to establish the 
guilty knowledge and assent of appellant concerning the criminal design 
of Dulcisimo Beltran and Simeon Marco.  And the established rule is 
that: </p>
  <p align="center">xxx
  xxx xxx
  </p>
  <p>"x x x a person may be convicted for the criminal act of another 
where, between them, there has been conspiracy or unity of purpose and 
intention in the commission of the crime charged.  In other words, the 
accused must be shown to have had guilty participation in the criminal 
design entertained by the slayer, <em>and this presupposes knowledge on his part of such criminal design</em>.
  It is not enough that there be a relation between the acts done by the
 principal and those attributed to the person charged as co-principal or
 accomplice; <em>it is furthermore, necessary that the latter, with knowledge of the former's criminal intent</em>,
 should cooperate with moral or material aid in the consummation of the 
crime x x x. " (People vs. Ibañez, 77 Phil. 664, 665-666; italics 
supplied). </p>
  <p>"The trial court, therefore, seriously erred in holding appellant 
responsible together with Dulcisimo Beltran and Simeon Marco for the 
death of the decedent on the basis of indirect conspiracy. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"3.  <em>Appellant cannot be held liable for the death of decedent under Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code.</em> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code provides that, 
'criminal liability shall be incurred by any person committing a felony (<em>delito</em>)
 although the wrongful act done be different from that which he 
intended.' Under this provision, one who commits an intentional felony 
is responsible for all the consequences which may naturally and 
logically result therefrom, whether foreseen or intended or not. (I 
Reyes, The Revised Penal Code, 6th ed., p. 62).
  </p>
  <p>"It cannot be denied that the stabbing of the decedent by the 
appellant which caused a slight wound on the former's hand was 
intentionally made; hence, a felony.  However, the ensuing death of the 
decedent was not the direct, natural, and logical consequence of the 
wound inflicted by the appellant.  <em>There was an active intervening cause</em>,
 which was no other than the sudden and unexpected appearance and 
participation of Simeon Marco and Dulcisimo Beltran.  And there is 
authority that <em>if the consequences produced have resulted from a 
distinct act or fact absolutely foreign from the criminal act, the 
offender is not responsible for such consequence</em>.  (<em>People vs. Rellin</em>, 77 Phil. 1038; I Reyes, 75).  (Pp. 18-22, Appellant's brief - pp. 53-57, Record.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All circumstances considered, We are not convinced beyond reasonable 
doubt that appellant was in any conspiracy with Simeon and Beltran to 
kill Bienvenido or any of the Sabelberos.  In the absence of clear and 
convincing evidence, We can only speculate as to why appellant did not 
join his son, Simeon, and Beltran in attacking Bienvenido after he had 
fallen to the ground.  Either the two were too fast for him and were 
thus able to act ahead of him or that he voluntarily desisted from 
further pursuing the deceased after hitting him on the left hand. In 
line with the presumption of innocence which We are constitutionally 
bound to accord him, We are constrained to hold that he had no homicidal
 intent.   He can be held criminally responsible only for the wound on 
the back of the left hand of the deceased which is described as a "stab 
wound, 2-1/2 inches wide at the back of the left hand" by witness Felix 
S. Toledo, the Sanitary Inspector, who examined the corpse.  And there 
being no evidence as to the period of incapacity or medical attendance 
consequent of said wound, appellant is guilty only of slight physical 
injuries.  (Aquino, The Revised Penal Code, Vol. II, p. 1258, 1961 ed.)
</p><p><strong>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</strong>, the decision 
appealed from is hereby modified, and in its stead, appellant is found 
guilty only of slight physical injuries and hereby sentenced to suffer 
the penalty of twenty (20) days of arresto menor, and to pay the costs.
