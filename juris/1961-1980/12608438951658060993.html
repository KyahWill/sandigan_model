				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review by certiorari the decision of the Court of 
Appeals (in CA-G. R. No. 24738-R), setting aside the alias writ of execution 
issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 11927 as null 
and void, and making permanent the preliminary injunction issued therein by the 
appellate court.
<p>Pursuant to a decision duly rendered by the Court of First Instance of Manila 
in Civil Case No. 11927 and affirmed by the Supreme Court,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> therein defendant Jose C. Zulueta was ordered 
to pay therein plaintiff George Edward Koster, Inc. "the sum of P46,093.77 with 
interest at the rate of 6% per annum from September 27, 1949, with respect to 
the sum of P30,000.00; and from December 8, 1949, as to the sum of P16,093.77, 
until the entire amount is fully paid." Said decision having become final and 
executory, a writ of execution was issued on December 28, 1956.</p>
<p>On April 27, 1957, Zulueta paid the plaintiff corporation, then under 
liquidation, J. A. Wolfson, liquidator, the sum of P46,093.77, for which the 
corporation's counsel issued a receipt in the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Received, for and in behalf of my client, G.E. Koster, Inc., Treasury 
Warrant No. 394899 dated April 23, 1957, in the amount of Forty Six Thousand 
Ninety three and 77/100 (P46,093.77) representing <i>full payment of the 
principal obligation</i> of Mr. Jose C. Zulueta to my client, G.E. Koster, 
Inc., for the above amount in G.R. No. L-9305, entitled G.E. Koster, Inc. 
<i>vs</i>. Jose C. Zulueta', in accordance with communications lately exchanged 
between Mr. Zulueta on the one hand, and Atty. J.A. Wolfson, as liquidator of 
G.E. Koster, Inc., and the undersigned, on the other hand, in connection with

<p>As a result, the Sheriff returned the writ of execution with the statement 
that it has been partially satisfied.</p>
<p>Subsequently, George E. Koster, Inc. transferred for a consideration its 
right to the unpaid balance of the judgment (representing the interest) against 
Zulueta, to the Exchange Investment, Ltd. On November 16, 1958, Exchange 
Investment, Ltd. was substituted for the judgment creditor George E. Koster, 
Inc. Thereafter, the transferee Exchange Investment, Ltd. petitioned the court 
<i>a quo</i> for the issuance of an <i>alias</i> writ of execution for the 
collection of the "unsatisfied part of the judgment". Defendant Zulueta filed an 
opposition to the petition claiming that there was condonation of the interest 
in consideration of his having helped in obtaining dollar allocations from the 
Central Bank in favor of American Builders, Inc. in which George E. Koster was 
personally interested together with one Mr. Lewis, and that there having been no 
reservation made in the receipt at the time of payment of the principal, the 
interest is presumed to have been paid in accordance with Article 1176 of the 
new Civil Code. Petitioner filed an opposition denying the fact of remission and 
arguing that neither the lawyer, who had no special authority, nor Koster 
personally, as mere stockholder of the corporation, could compromise the 
judgment in favor of the corporation by remitting the interest. After due 
hearing, the court, in a reasoned order dated January 16, 1959, sustained the 
contention of petitioner Exchange Investment, Ltd. and issued the <i>alias</i> 
writ of execution. Zulueta filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied 
in the court's order of March 12, 1959. Copy thereof was served on said 
defendant on March 17, 1959.</p>
<p>On April 18, 1959, and after the Sheriff of Manila had already placed under 
garnishment certain properties belonging to the defendant the latter filed in 
the Court of Appeals an original petition for certiorari and secured from said 
court a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the City Sheriff to refrain 
from enforcing the aforementioned <i>alias</i> writ of execution.</p>
<p>After due hearing on the matter, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment, 
dated July 30, 1959, holding that there was condonation of the interest payable 
by Zulueta effected prior to the transfer of G. E. Koster, Inc.'s interest to 
the Exchange Investments, Ltd., and that the trial court, therefore, gravely 
erred in issuing the <i>alias</i> writ of execution for the collection of said 
interest. The <i>alias</i> writ of execution was set aside and the preliminary 
injunction made permanent. The petitioner now comes to us seeking to nullify the 
said decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>As urged by herein petitioners in their brief, the petition for certiorari 
filed by Jose C. Zulueta on April 18, 1959, or 32 days after he was notified of 
the court's denial of his motion for reconsideration of the order for the 
issuance of an <i>alias</i> writ of execution, should have been dismissed, 
appeal therefrom being the proper remedy.</p>
<p>Rule 67 of the Rules of Court provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. <i>Petition for certiorari</i>.—When any tribunal, board, or 
officer exercising judicial functions, has acted without or in excess of its or 
his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion and there is no appeal, nor 
any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person 
aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court alleging the 
facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or 
modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer as the law 
requires, with costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is explicit thereunder, that for a writ of certiorari to issue, it must 
not only be shown that the board, tribunal or officer acted without or in excess 
of jurisdiction, or in grave abuse of discretion, but also there is no appeal or 
other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law available 
to the aggrieved party.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, it is not disputed that the trial court's order of 
January 16, 1959, directing the issuance of the <i>alias</i> writ of execution 
in question, as well as that of March 12, 1959, denying respondent Zulueta's 
motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid order, not being interlocutory are 
appealable. No appeal from said orders, however, was interposed within the 
reglementary period, nor any reason given for such failure.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Under the circumstances, and the right to 
appeal having been lost for reasons not herein proved to be excusable, a 
petition for certiorari is not proper,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
<p>It is true, that in several instances, this Court allowed petitions for 
certiorari notwithstanding the existence of appeal therein. It may be pointed 
out, however, that in those instances, the orders complained of were either 
issued in excess of or without jurisdiction,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> or that, for certain special considerations, 
as public welfare or public policy,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> this 
Court has decided to entertain the action. In other words, those are exceptional 
instances where the provisions of Section 1 of Rule 67 abovequoted are not 
strictly applied. The case at bar, certainly, does not fall within the 
exception.</p>
<p>It is also argued that certiorari is the appropriate remedy where, as in this 
case, execution had already been commenced, respondent citing Santos <i>vs</i>. 
Pecson, 79 Phil., 261, wherein this Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mere possible delay in the perfection of an appeal and in securing a 
decision from the appellate court is no justification for departing from the 
prescribed procedure. Delay might be a good ground for invoking the 
extraordinary remedy in cases where there was lack or excess of jurisdiction or 
abuse of discretion and the delay would work injustice to the complaining party 
or <i>make the appeal ineffectual to redress the error</i>; where, for instance, 
execution had been issued, a receiver had been appointed, or attachment had been 
levied, and there is no time to waste. * * *." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Evidently, the above pronouncement contemplates of instances where there is 
right to appeal, said right still existing and available, but would be 
inadequate to prevent the injury or wrong sought to be corrected. Hence, this 
Court declared that certiorari may be allowed. This pronouncement cannot be 
invoked in the instant case, because not only is there no showing that appeal 
from the disputed orders would be inadequate and insufficient remedy, but also 
that, the right to such appeal, at the time the petition for certiorari was 
filed, has already been lost—through respondent's own fault and negligence—and 
no longer available. Furthermore, the execution of the order (to enforce 
collection of the interest) was made <i>after</i> the expiration of the period 
to appeal without such appeal having been perfected. Clearly, respondent lost 
his right to question the correctness of said order.</p>
<p>With the foregoing conclusion, there is no need for us to pass upon the other 
issues raised by petitioners.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed and set 
aside, and the orders of the court <i>a quo</i> of January 16, 1959 and March 
12, 1959 affirmed, with costs against respondent Zulueta. So 
ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,
