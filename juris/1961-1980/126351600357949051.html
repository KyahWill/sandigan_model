				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On January 18, 1962, a shipment of one tractor (<span class="SpellE">Hyster</span> D7L, Tractor Donkey), consigned to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Al­fredo <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span>, was
unloaded from the M/S "Eastern Ga­laxy", with freight and other
charges in the total amount of $357.08 actually paid to the carrier. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This tractor was bought from the Pacific Trade
&amp; Surety Co., Inc. of <st1:place><st1:city>San Francisco</st1:city>, <st1:state>California</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The price of $10,381.00 was paid through the
letter of credit FMC No. 1122 drawn by the Philippine Commercial and Industrial
Bank, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shipment was unloaded to the custody of
the Manila Port Service, a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company, which was
the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The value of the shipment was not specified
in the bill of lading nor in the inward manifest of the carrier.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 24, 1962, having been notified of the arrival of the
shipment, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a provisional claim with
the Manila Port Service for the value of the shipment pursuant to section 15 of
the management con­tract entered into between the Bureau of Customs and the
Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> broker tried to secure the delivery of the
shipment from the Manila Port Service under authority of the warehouse permit
No. 9098, but the shipment could not be located and so no delivery could be
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 2, 1962, in order to
comply with the requirements for the release of the shipment and to enable the
Bureau of Customs to com­pute the duties, taxes and other charges based on the
cost, insurance and freightage, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed an
applica­tion for marine insurance on the shipment with the Agricultural Fire
Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. Not knowing that the shipment had already
arrived, the Agricultural Fire Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. issued a marine
insur­ance policy on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1962</st1:date>,
covering the shipment, and it appeared in the policy that the value of the
shipment was P20,917.72.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1962</st1:date>,
the Manila Port Service collected from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the amount of P40.50 as fees for the <span class="SpellE">ar­rastre</span>
service, based on measurement and/or weight of the shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="5">May
 18, 1962</st1:date>, the Manila Port Service is­sued a certificate stating
that the shipment was lost or missing while it was under its custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="10">October
 23, 1962</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed with the
Manila Port Service a formal claim for the value of the shipment and the
freight charges thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Manila Port
Service and/or Manila Railroad Company did not act - either to admit or reject
-on <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> provisional claim of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1962</st1:date> nor on the formal
claim of <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1962</st1:date>,
and neither was pay­ment made to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for the
value of the tractor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1962</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> also filed a formal claim with the Agricultural
Fire Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. for the payment of the value of the
shipment in accordance with the marine insurance policy covering the shipment,
but the claim was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the
denials of the claims, both by the Manila Port Service and/or Manila Railroad
Company and by the Agricultural Fire Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> brought an action against these entities in the
Court of First Instance of Manila on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="3">March
 6, 1963</st1:date> (Civil Case No. 53301).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the submission of documentary evidence by the parties, in
addition to the stipulation of facts, the Court of First Instance of Manila, on
December 23, 1963, rendered a decision ordering the Manila Port Service and
Manila Railroad Company to pay <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span> the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED
SIXTY-TWO (P20,762.00) PESOS representing the value of the lost shipment, and
the sum of SIX HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR PESOS AND TEN CENTAVOS (P654.10) representing
the freight charges on the shipment, both with interest at the legal rate from
the date of the fil­ing of the complaint on March 6, 1963 until fully paid, and
to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint against
the Agricultural Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counter­claim of the Agricultural Fire
Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. against plaintiff Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span>
was also dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the
cross-claim of the Agricultural Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. against the
Manila Port Service and/or Manila Railroad Company was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the lower court, defendants
Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company appealed directly to this
Court, on questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal, appellants Manila Port Service and Manila
Railroad Company contend:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the
trial court erred in not holding that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
complaint is barred pursuant to section 15 of the management contract between
the Bureau of Customs and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator; and
(2) that, assuming that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> complaint was
filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, the trial court
erred in not holding that appellants' liability, if any, should not exceed
P500.00, also pursuant to section 15 of the manage­ment contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first contention, the appellants invoke the
pertinent portion of section 15 of the manage­ment contract which provides as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"’x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> in any event the CONTRACTOR
shall be relieved and released of any and all res­ponsibility or liability for
loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">mis­delivery</span> and/or non-delivery of
goods, unless suit in the court of proper jurisdiction is brought within a
period of one (1) year from the date of the discharge of goods, or from the
date when the claim for the value of such goods have been rejected or denied by
the CONTRACTOR, provided that such claim shall have been filed with the
CONTRACTOR within fifteen (15) days from the date of the dis­charge of the last
package from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellants point out that the shipment in ques­tion was
discharged from the carrying vessel on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1962</st1:date>, and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed his
complaint only on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1963</st1:date>,
or more than one year after the discharge of the shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants also point out that the claims
of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> - the <span class="SpellE">provisonal</span>
claim of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1962</st1:date>
and the formal claim of <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="10">October 23,
 1962</st1:date> - were not acted upon by the appellants Manila Port Service
and Manila Railroad Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then said
appellants maintain that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> complaint was
barred under the provisions of section 15 of the management contract because of
his failure to file the complaint within one year from the date of the
discharge of the shipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the position of the appellants that under sec­tion 15 of
the management contract the claimant - <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in
the present case, has the choice of one of two periods within which to file the
complaint, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) within one year
from the date of the discharge of the goods, without waiting for the action on
the claim; or (2) within one year from the date of the rejection or denial of
the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the second
period, the appellants maintain that this (second) period may only be availed
of if the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator had rejected or denied
the claim, because the re­jection or denial is a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u>
<u>non</u> before the claimant may bring suit, and that the rejection or denial
must always take place within one year from the date of the discharge of the
goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, in the case at bar, it is
the contention of the appellants that because the shipment was discharged on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1962</st1:date>, and the claims of
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had not been acted upon by the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator within the one-year period from <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1962</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should have filed his complaint on or before <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants, therefore, claim that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> complaint, which was filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1963</st1:date>, was already barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the appellants cannot be sustain­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now the settled ruling of this Court,
in a series of recent decisions, that when the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
opera­tor fails to act on the claim within the period of one year from the date
of the discharge of the goods the claim is deemed rejected as of the expiration
of one year from the date of discharge of the last package, in which case the
action should be filed within one year from said rejection.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The procedure under section 15 of the manage­ment
contract may, therefore, be restated, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the claimant must file a claim with the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> oper­ator within fifteen days from the date of the
discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel; and then he may choose
one of two alternatives in enforcing his rights before the courts, either (1)
to file his complaint within one year from the date of the discharge of the
last pack­age, without awaiting the action of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator on his claim; or (2) to await the action of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator on his claim, and if the claim is rejected or denied, to file the
complaint within one year from the date of the rejection or denial, it being
understood that if the claim has not been acted within one year from the date
of the discharge of the last package the claim is deemed re­jected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case now at bar the shipment was discharged from the
carrying vessel on January 18, 1962, and the <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span>
filed a provisional claim on January 24, 1962, well within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of fifteen days as provided in section
15 of the management contract, and also a formal claim on October 23, 1962, and
those claims were not acted upon by the appellants as of January 18, 1963, so
that the claim of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was deemed rejected as
of January 18, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, therefore, had a period of one year from January
18, 1963 within which to file his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the complaint was filed on March 6, 1963, it is clear that
said complaint was filed on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other point raised by the appellants is the al­leged error
committed by the lower court in not holding that the liability of the
appellants, if any, should not exceed P500.00 in accordance with section 15 of
the manage­ment contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
portion of section 15 of the management contract, invoked in this connection by
the ap­pellants, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"'Sec. 15. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
and the CONTRACTOR shall be solely responsible as an independent contractor
for, and promptly pay to the steam­ship company, consignee, consignor, or other
interested party or parties the invoice value of each package but which in no
case shall be more than five hundred pesos (P500.00) for each package unless
value is otherwise specified or manifested and the corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges had been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that since the value of the shipment is
question was not specified in the bill of lading or in the shipping manifest
and that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> paid <span class="SpellE">ar­rastre</span>
charges only on the basis of measurement or weight, their liability for said
shipment, if any, should be li­mited to P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court found, however, that on March
2, 1962, or before the amount of P40.50 was col­lected by the appellant Manila
Port Service from the <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span> as <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges on the shipment, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
filed with the Agricultural Fire Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. an
application for marine insurance covering the shipment - which insurance policy
was issued on March 3, 1962 - in or­der to comply with a condition required for
the release of the shipment and to enable the Bureau of Customs to compute the
taxes and other legal charges on the shipment based on the value of the goods,
insurance and freight; so much so that when appellant Manila Port Service
collected the <span class="SpellE">ar­rastre</span> service fee of P40.50 on
March 24, 1962, said ap­pellant already knew the value of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
shipment, and said appellant could have collected from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges based on the value
of the shipment as appearing in the insurance policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the lower court when it said "that the
submission of the marine insurance policy, Exhibit 'C', to the Bureau of
Customs is sufficient compliance with the re­quirement of Sec. 15 of the
Management Contract whereby the liability of the Manila Port Service for lost
or destroyed cargo may exceed P500.00 and such liability may be for the value
of the shipment by specifying or manifesting such value because the said marine
insurance policy is one of the documents required to be presented by the
plaintiff in clearing the merchandize from the customs."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The provision in par. 15 of the Management Contract limiting
the contractor's liability for the loss, des­truction or damage of any
merchandise to P500 for each package, unless the value is otherwise specified
and the corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges have been
paid, is neither unfair nor arbi­trary, because the consignee, if he so
desires, can make the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator responsible
for the full value of his merchandise by merely specifying it in any of the
various documents required of him in clearing the merchandise from the customs
and paying the corres­ponding charges on the basis of the de­clared
value."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Jose <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
&amp; Co. v. Delgado Brothers, Inc., 58 0.G., 1104)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as the lower court has declared, appellant Manila Port
Service cannot escape liability for the value of the shipment by its own act of
not charging the <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span> the corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> fees based on the value of the shipment after it
came to know of such declared value from the marine insurance policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Settled is the rule that the value of the
merchandise or shipment may be declared or stated not only in the bill of
lading or ship­ping manifest but also in other documents required by law before
the shipment is cleared from the piers.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find, therefore, that the lower court committed no error when
it declared the appellants, Manila Port Ser­vice and Manila Railroad Company,
liable for the payment of the value of the shipment as stated in the marine
insur­ance policy as well as the freight charges on the shipment, it being
admitted that the shipment, consisting of a tract­or, was lost while it was in
the custody of appellant Manila Port Service.</p>

affirmed, with costs against the defendants-appellants.</p>
