				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DAYATON MANIBPEL, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal taken by Dayaton Manibpel from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Cotabato in Criminal Case No. 2293 finding him guilty of bigamy and 
sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) months of arresto mayor, 
as minimum, to two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision 
correccional</i>, as maximum, and to pay the costs. The court considered in his 
favor the mitigating circumstance of his being a Muslim inhabitant of a Moro 
province.
<p>Appellant was charged with bigamy as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That in or about December, 1954, in the barrio of Lamperal, Municipality of 
Bañga, province of Cotabato, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the said accused Dayaton Manibpel, being previously united in 
lawful marriage with Conding Makambang, and without the said marriage having 
been legally dissolved, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
contract a subsequent or second marriage with Mora Babaya 
Badio."</p></blockquote>
<p>On arraignment, he pleaded not guilty. During the trial and while the 
prosecution's third witness, Adel Pamanay, was being cross-examined, appellant 
agreed that should said witness swear by the Koran to the truth of his 
testimony, he would withdraw his plea of not guilty and substitute it with one 
of guilty. As after concluding his testimony Pamanay swore by the Koran, 
appellant was arraigned anew and—as he had promised—pleaded guilty. The court 
forthwith rendered—so it thought—a judgment sentencing appellant to suffer an 
indeterminate penalty of not less than six (6) months of arresto mayor nor more 
than two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) year of <i>prision 
correccional</i>, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>Appellant appealed, but upon motion of the Solicitor General, we remanded the 
case to the trial court because the decision was not signed. On September 29, 
1958, the lower court rendered the appealed judgment—a reiteration of the 
previous unsigned decision. Hence the present appeal.,</p>
<p>Appellant contends in the first assignment of error that the case should be 
remanded below for further proceedings on the ground that "the trial court erred 
in sanctioning the swearing by the Koran as the basis of the withdrawal by the 
appellant of the original plea of "not guilty" and its substitution with a plea 
of guilty."</p>
<p>In his second assignment of error he contends that, if convicted, the penalty 
to be imposed upon him should be at least two degrees lower than <i>prision 
mayor</i> because he is entitled to the consideration in his favor of the 
following mitigating circumstances, namely: the fact that he is a Muslim 
residing in Mindanao; lack of instruction; mistake of fact, and voluntary plea 
of guilty.</p>
<p>We find no merit in appellant's contentions.</p>
<p>It appearing from the record that upon re-arraignment appellant voluntarily 
withdrew his plea of not guilty and substituted it with one of guilty, the fact 
that he did so because prosecution witness Pamanay, after the conclusion of his 
testimony given under the usual oath, swore by the Koran that his aforesaid 
testimony was true, becomes of no consequence. As a matter of fact, even if 
Pamanay took no such oath by the Koran, appellant's withdrawal of his original 
plea and his subsequent plea of guilty would have been perfectly regular. On the 
other hand, it is obvious that the fact that Pamanay did not hesitate to swear 
by the Koran that his whole testimony—given under oath—was true is further 
guarantee of his credibility.</p>
<p>In connection with the second assignment of error, the record shows that the 
fact that appellant is a Muslim residing in Mindanao was already taken into 
consideration by the lower court. His alleged lack of instruction, on the other 
hand, cannot be considered in his favor because of lack of evidence to prove it, 
while the alleged "mistake of fact" committed by him, even if true, does not 
constitute a mitigating circumstance. Lastly, his plea of guilty cannot be 
considered in his favor because it was entered only after three prosecution 
witnesses had completed their testimony.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision being in accordance with law, the same is 
affirmed, with costs.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, 
Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
