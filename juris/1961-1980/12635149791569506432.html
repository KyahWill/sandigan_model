				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Acting on a petition duly filed, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> (<span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span> Branch)
rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1958" day="5" month="11">November 5,
 1958</st1:date> admitting to probate the document pur­porting to be the last
will and testament of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T.
Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same decision the court
also ordered the summary settlement of the deceased's estate, upon a finding
that the testator left no outstanding debts or obliga­tions and that the
approximate gross value of the estate war only P4<span class="GramE">,970.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the document <span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>A' is hereby allowed and declared probated as the last
Will and Testament of, the late TEODORO T. CRUZ, and the estate left by him
consist­ing of thirteen (13) parcels of land, all situated in <span class="SpellE">Bugallon</span> and Aguilar, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
and more specifically described in said <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A', is <u>hereby
ordered summarily settled and adjudicated in favor of the person therein
mentioned in the manner, form and proportion set forth in the said last Will
and Testa­ment of the above-mentioned decedent</u>, subject, however, to the
liability provided for in Sec. 4, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let the Register of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
be furnished with a certified copy of this decision and a true copy of the said
last Will and Testament (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. 'A'),
and its corresponding translation (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
‘A-1’), of the late <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz for purposes of
registration thereof in his office, and let also the Internal Revenue Agent at <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City be served with a true copy of said decision
for collection, if any, of the corresponding inheritance tax."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1958</st1:date>
some of the heirs of the deceased moved for the elimination of that portion of
the decision ordering the summary settlement and distribution of the thirteen
(13) parcels of land listed in the will in the manner, form and proportion
provided for therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said order was
questioned on two principal grounds, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) that as the terms of the will indicated, the thirteen (13) parcels
of land described therein belonged to the conjugal partnership of the testator
and his first deceased wife, <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, for which reason the testator could not validly
dispose of all of them; and (b) that inasmuch as the testator died when the new
Civil Code was already in effect, the dispositions in the will made in
accordance with the provisions of the old Civil Code must be altered to conform
to the provisions of the New Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="2">February
 17, 1959</st1:date>, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> denied the motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the court:</p>

<blockquote>"The basis for reconsideration are two, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that it is admitted in the Will that the
thirteen (13) parcels of land include the 1/2 portion belonging to the
deceased's first wife; and that, the disposition made in the will was in
accordance with the provisions of the Old Civil Code when the testator died
after the New Civil Code took effect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the first ground, there is no need for this
Court to recon­sider, for the simple reason that the probate of the will and
the settlement thereof does not vest to the devisees and legatees mentioned in
the will any property which does not belong to the testator and, hence, there
is no need for this Court to make a pronouncement to that effect since the law
on the matter is supreme.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the second ground, there is no showing that
the will has, by its provisions, granted more than what the devisees and
legatees would receive or what the testator could dispose or that the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the heirs was paired."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this order of denial none of the parties appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until about four months later, on
June 29, 1959, that the same heirs who filed the motion of November 19, 1958
again filed a petition in the same case, this time praying for the appointment of
one <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span> as
administrator of the estate of the deceased spouses <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
T. Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
alleging that an administrator was necessary "(a) to gather all the
properties of the deceased spouses ... (whether described in the will or not)
and to prepare a project of partition of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> in accordance with the provisions of the Civil
Code on intestate succession, and the estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz, in accordance with the Will (after
eliminating the properties sold by him) as modified by the New Civil Code, and
(b) to pay the estate and inheritance tax if any is to be paid." Besides
reiterating the reasons advanced in support of their previous motion for
reconsideration, petitioners alleged two new matters, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that aside from the properties enumerated
in the will, there were three (3) other parcels of land - locally called TAROY,
BARAO, and KISKISAN - belonging to the estate which has not been included in
the will; and (2) that the inclusion of the parcel of land described under
letter "f" of the will was erroneous since said parcel no longer
belonged to the estate it having been earlier purchased by the predecessor of
one of the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two other heirs of the deceased - <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
T. Cruz and Cecilia T. Cruz, now appellants - did not join petitioners but
filed an opposition instead, asserting that the same issue and subject-matter
raised in the petition had been passed upon by the court in its decision dated
November 5, 1958, which was already final and conclusive; that all of the heirs
and legatees of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz had accepted their
respective shares of the estate in accordance with the terms of his last will
and testament, and such acceptance could no longer be impugned at that late
date; that the properties claimed to have been omitted in the will be­longed
not to the deceased but to appellants; and finally, that there was no need for
an administrator since the heirs and legatees had already taken possession of
their respective shares.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> overruled the opposition and favorably
acted on the petition in an order issued on <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1959</st1:date>, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the properties described in the last will
and testament of the late <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz were not
his exclusive properties but were of the conjugal partnership of the testator
and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>;
considering that although the will has been allowed to probate, the probate of
the will does not go into the intrinsic validity of the provision of the will;
and considering further, that whenever the property of one of the spouses, both
of whom are already deceased, is subject to a testate and intestate
proceedings, the liquida­tion of the conjugal partnership shall also take
place; as prayed for, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nar­ciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span> of Aguilar, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, is
hereby appointed administrator of the estate of the spouses, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, upon the filing of a bond in the sum of
P2,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a bond has been filed
and the administra­tor has taken his oath of office, let the corresponding
letters of administra­tion issue in his favor.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants moved to reconsider but were turned down, whereupon
they brought the case to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 26694-R) in a
petition for certiorari to set aside the order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1960</st1:date>
the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition as without merit and affirmed the
appointment of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>
as administrator in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> purpose of an administra­tion of the estate of a
deceased person is the liquidation of that estate and the distribution of the
residue thereof among the heirs and legatees after the payment of all debts and
liabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Liquidation means
determination of all the assets of the estate and payment of all debts and
expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To effect­uate this mandate of
the law, the pro­bate court has the authority and is duty-bound to appoint an
administrator who would administer the estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appearing that three other properties (called locally as <span class="SpellE">Taroy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barao</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Kiskisan</span>) allegedly belonging to the deceased spouses have
not been brought into the administration of the estate or intestate estate of
said deceased spouses, there exists good reason to warrant the appointment of
an adminis­trator."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This decision has since then become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eventually, and pursuant to the authority granted him as administrator
of the disputed estate, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>
sub­mitted on February 10, 1961 an inventory of all the properties allegedly
belonging to the testator, including not only those enumerated in the will but
also those not mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1962</st1:date> the administrator was
required by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> to submit to it a project of
partition, which he did on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="7">July 25,
 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants opposed the
project of parti­tion on the principal ground that it practically disregarded
the last will and testament of the testator which had been admitted to probate
in the decision of <st1:date year="1958" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1958</st1:date>
and disregarded likewise the summary settlement of the estate made in the same
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1962</st1:date>
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> approved the project of partition and explained:</p>

<blockquote>"If the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> believe that
there<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is any parcel of land not included
in the project of partition, they may resort to court for the partition of said
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And finding the project of
partition to be equitable, legal and in accordance with the existing law as
well as the last will and testament of the late <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
T. Cruz, the same is hereby approved, and the parties are enjoined to be guided
by the terms thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration of this last order having been
denied, appellants brought this case here on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue raised by appellants is that the estate of
the deceased <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz, as well as that of his
deceased wife <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
had been summarily settled by the decision of the Court of November 5, 1958,
end therefore could no longer be partitioned anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is pertinent to note at this point that
when herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' motion to reconsider that
decision was denied on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="2">February 17,
 1959</st1:date>, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> stated the following, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, in its order of denial:</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the second ground, there is no showing that
the will has, by its provisions, granted more than what the devisees and
legatees would receive or what the testator could dis­pose or that the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the heirs was impaired."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the lower court found and so declared that the
dispositions in the will, insofar as the shares of the heirs, devisees and
legatees were concerned, were in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that declaration has long be­come
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, no appeal was taken from
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of summary settlement was,
of course, justified under Section 2 of Rule 74; and there is no showing that
the procedural requisites laid down therein had not been followed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reference has been made to the fact that the will of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz, in accordance with which the decree of
summary settlement was issued, disposed not only of his own share of the
thirteen (13) parcels of land enumerated therein but also of the share of his
deceased wife, the said lands being admittedly conjugal properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this is not quite true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the testator said in his will with
respect to the properties of his deceased wife was that he had already given to
his children their respective shares in those properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously their partition been made by them <span class="SpellE">intervivos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a
child had not receive the full share, as in the case of the daughter named
Juana T. Cruz, the testator made this special provision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The fact that the share I gave to my
daughter, Juana T. Cruz, as her share from her mother is very insufficient, I
now give to her the lands covered by Tax Nos. 9894, 14083 and 14091, all valued
at P630.00." This disposition, and the ones in favor of the other heirs,
were duly mentioned in the will, and judicially approved when the Court ordered
the summary settlement of the estate "in the manner, form and proportion
set forth" in said will.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued for <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that the
questioned pro­ject of partition is necessary because the dispositions made in
the will are contrary to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
belied by the order of February 17, 1959, which held that "there is no
showing that the will has ... granted more than what the devisees and legatees
would receive or what the testator could dispose (of) or that the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the heirs was impaired.” In any case, herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> should have appealed from that order, as well as
from the main decision itself, if they wanted to question the validity of the
testamentary dispositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only did
they fail to appeal, but after the order of summary settlement had become final
all the <span class="SpellE">distributees</span> - <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
included - accepted their res­pective shares of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some took actual possession, others had their
shares transferred in their names and a few sold and disposed of their shares
in favor of third persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The summary
settlement and distribution of the estate - both of the husband and his
deceased wife - was therefore not only an adjudicated matter; it was actually
accepted by the heirs and carried out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And under Article 1056 of the Civil Code, "the acceptance of an
inheritance, once made, is irrevocable and cannot be impugned, except when it
was made through any of the causes that vitiate consent or when an unknown will
appears.”</p>

<p class="BODY">A new project of partition with respect to the same properties is
no longer legally feasible.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the properties locally called <span class="SpellE"><u>Taroy</u></span>,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Barao</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Kiskisan</u></span>,
it should be noted that they are not mentioned in the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These parcels of land, according to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, also form part of the deceased's estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants assert otherwise and say they are
the exclusive owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of these
conflicting claims, the question of ownership must first be ventilated in an ap­propriate
proceeding, and hence their partition at this time is not in order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
approving the project of partition is hereby set aside, without prejudice to
the administration and eventual partition of other properties not mentioned in
the will of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> T. Cruz and
admittedly belonging to him and his deceased wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</span></p>
