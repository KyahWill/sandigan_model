				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a direct appeal on a question of <span style="">law </span>taken by Pastor B. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>
from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
denying his motion for the admis­sion of his amended complaint in Civil Case
No. 5924, entitled "Pastor B. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's complaint alleged, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>,
that he had, by a fictitious deed <span style="">or </span>absolute
sale annexed thereto, conveyed to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on October
30, 1953, for a consideration of P8,000.00, the two-storey house and four (4)
sub­division lots covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 20174 issued by
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on October 25, 1950 in
the name of Pastor B. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> <span class="SpellE">Geukeko</span>, with the
understanding that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would hold the properties
in trust for their il­legitimate son, Pastor <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>,
Jr., still unborn at <span style="">the </span>time of
the conveyance; that thereafter <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> mort­gaged
said properties to the Republic Savings Bank of Manila twice to secure payment
of two loans, one of P3,000.00 and the other of P2,000.00, and that thereafter
she offered them for sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint
then prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction restraining <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and her <span style="">agents
or </span>representatives from further alienating or dispos­ing of the
properties, and for judgment ordering her to exe­cute a deed of absolute sale
of said properties in favor of Pastor B. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>,
Jr., the beneficiary (who, at the <span style="">filing
of said complaint, was about five years of age), </span>and to pay attorney's
fees in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the conveyance mentioned heretofore, TCT No. 20714
in the name of plaintiff was partially can­celled and in lieu thereof, TCT No.
32744 was issued by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in
the name of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="12">December <span style="">16, </span><span style="">1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">appellee</span> moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that
it stated no cause of action because Pastor <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>,
Jr., the beneficiary of the alleged trust, was not included as <span class="GramE">party-plaintiff,</span> and on the further ground that appellant's
cause of action was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his opposition to said motion to dismiss, appel­lant argued
that the Statute of Frauds does not apply to trustee and <span class="SpellE">cestui</span>
<span class="SpellE">que</span> trust as in the <span class="GramE">case</span> of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and her illegitimate child, and that for this
reason appellant would not be barred from proving by <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence an implied trust existing under Article 1453 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, in her rejoinder to
appellant's opposition, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> argued that what the
former was invoking in his complaint (Paragraph V, Complaint) was an implied
trust under Article 1453 of the Civil Code and not an express trust under
Section 3, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding the grounds alleged in the motion to
dismiss to be meritorious, the trial court dismissed the complaint, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after receiving notice of said order of dismissal,
appellant filed a motion for the admission of an amended complaint, attaching
thereto a copy thereof, the amendment consisting mainly of the inclusion of the
minor, Pastor <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>, Jr. as co-plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended com­plaint further prayed for the
appointment of appellant as said minor's guardian <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition thereto was filed on the ground
that the amendment aforesaid was not an inclusion but a substitution of the
party plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the latter had no
interest whatsoever in the subject matter of the case, it was argued that the
substitution was not allowed in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's answer to <span class="SpellE">appel­lee's</span>
opposition alleged that, as the ground relied upon in said opposition was
purely technical, even the substitution of the party plaintiff should be
allowed under Section 2, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the lower court issued the
appealed order denying appellant's motion for the admission of his amended
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the
instant direct appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The original as well as the amended complaint men­tioned above
allege that the sale made by appellant <span class="SpellE">Cons­tantino</span>
in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of the properties described in
said pleadings was subject to the agreement that the vendee <span style="">would hold them in trust for their at that
time already conceived but unborn illegitimate child; that the vendee violated
this agreement, firstly, by subjecting them to two different contracts of
mortgage, and later by trying to sell them, this being not only in violation of
the aforesaid agreement but prejudicial to the <span class="SpellE">cestui</span>
<span class="SpellE">que</span> trust; that the action was commenced to compel
the vendee to comply with their agreement by executing the correspond­ing deed
of conveyance in favor of their minor son, and to desist from further doing any
act prejudicial to the inter­ests of the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears then that, upon the facts alleged by appellant, the
contract between him and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was <span class="GramE">a contract <u><span style="">pour</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>autrui</u></span>,
although couched in the form of a deed of absolute sale, and that appellant's
action was, in effect, one for specific performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That one of the par­ties to a contract is
entitled to bring an action for its enforcement or to prevent its breach is too
clear to need any extensive discussion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, that the contract involved contained a stipulation <u><span style="">pour</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>autrui</u></span> am­plifies this settled
rule only in the sense that the third person for whose benefit the contract was
entered into may also demand its fulfillment provided he had communicated his
acceptance thereof to the obligor before the stipula­tion in his favor is
revoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing that the amended complaint submitted by appellant to
the lower court <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> the beneficiary under the
contract as a party co-plaintiff, it seems clear that the three parties
concerned therewith would, as a result, be before the court and the latter's
adjudication would be complete and binding upon them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>, 55 Phil. 527 involving facts similar to the ones
before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is of obvious application to the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote the following pertinent
portions of our decision in said case:</p>

<blockquote>"This action was instituted in the Court of First Instance or
Occidental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> by <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span>
Rosales de <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>, assisted by her husband En­rique <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>, for the purpose of obtaining a judicial order requiring
the defendant Maria <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>, as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate of her deceased husband, Manuel Gay <span class="SpellE">Yulingco</span>,
as well as the heirs of said decedent, to execute in due form a contract, with
appropriate descrip­tion of the real property involved, in con­formity with the
terms of <span style="">an agreement </span>dated
September 3, 1927, executed by the deceased Manuel Gay <span class="SpellE">Yulingco</span>,
in life, and Enrique <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>, one of the plaintiffs in
the case (Exhibit A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this action the
defendants interposed a general answer and cross-com­plaint, in the latter of
which they sought a decree annulling the contract Exhibit A as excessively
onerous and illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing the
cause the trial court absolved the plaintiffs from the cross-complaint and gave
judgment in favor of the plaintiffs upon the complaint, requiring the
defendants, within thirty days from the date of the finality of the decision,
to execute before a notary public and deliver to the plaintiffs a con­tract
similar in terms to that indicated in the Exhibit A but containing, in addition,
a description of the real property involved, in such form as would enable the
plaintiff's to procure said contract to be inscribed on the certificate of
title corresponding to said property, with costs against the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this judgment the defendants appealed.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The contract in question, Exhibit A, on which this action is based,
was executed by Manuel Gay <span class="SpellE">Yulingco</span> and Enrique <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>, and although the contract binds <span class="SpellE">Yulingco</span>
to pay to <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> Rosales de <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>,
the wife of Enrique <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>, the sum of fifty centavos
for each <span class="SpellE">picul</span> of sugar that may be produced upon the
two haciendas covered by the contract during the fourteen years beginning with
the crop for 1927-1928, nevertheless this action is not instituted by the nominal
beneficiary, <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> Rosales de <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>,
directly for the purpose <span style="">of </span>obtaining
the benefit which said contract purports to con­fer upon her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the action is to compel the
defendants to execute a con­tract pursuant to the tenor of the contract Exhibit
A, but containing an adequate <span style="">de­scription
</span>of the property contained in the two haciendas, for the purpose of
enabling <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span> to procure the annotation of said
contract on the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> certificates of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore evident that, technically
speaking, the proper person to bring this action is Enrique <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>,
the person with whom the contract was made by <span class="SpellE">Yulingco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is, </span>nevertheless, equally obvious that the
wife of Enrique <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span> is a party in interest, and
she is certainly a proper, if not an entirely necessary party to the ac­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It results that there is really no improper <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of <span class="GramE">parties</span>
plaintiff."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Whether the contract of sale entered into between appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was - as claimed in the amended complaint -
subject to the agreement that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would hold the
properties <u>in</u> <u>trust</u> for their unborn child is a question of fact
that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> may raise in her answer for the lower
court to determine after trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, the contention that the contract in question is not enforceable by
action by reason of the provisions of the Statute of Frauds does not appear to
be <u>indubitable</u>, it being clear upon the facts alleged in the amended
complaint that the contract between the parties had already been <u><span style="">partially</span></u><span style=""> </span>performed by the ex­ecution of the deed of sale, the action
brought below being only for the enforcement of another phase thereof, namely,
the execution by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span style="">of </span>a deed of conveyance in favor of the beneficiary <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order is hereby set aside and the
case is remanded to the lower <span style="">co</span>urt
for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur, but it may not be amiss for me to state briefly my
humble view as regards <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim that
appellant's action is barred by the Statute of Frauds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>I understand the
nature of appellant's action, it is not to enforce <span style="">an </span>entirely unwritten contract, which <span style="">is </span>what is generally barred by the Statute of Frauds; rather, it
is for the enforce­ment; of a condition not appearing in the written agreement
herein involved but which condition, ac­cording to appellant, was in fact part
thereof but which the parties had agreed not to include in the deed, probably
because of doubt that such a stipu­lation in favor of an already conceived but
still unborn illegitimate child may not be judicially permissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, under the theory of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, even assuming, alternatively, that there was such
an understanding to benefit their unborn child, the, conveyance to her of the
land in ques­tion is an entirely separate contract from the ob­ligation assumed
by her of turning over the proper­ty in question to said child with the
appellant, hence this separate agreement not being in writing is unenforceable
by action under the Statute of Frauds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
consider such posture of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> unten­able.</p>

<p class="BODY">To my mind, the obligation of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to execute the conveyance in favor of their child was part and parcel of one
single verbal agreement, in partial implementation of which the said proper­ty
was conveyed to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
appellant's action is simply one for the enforcement of an im­plied trust under
Article 1453 of the Civil Code which provides thus:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1453<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When</span> property is conveyed to a person in reliance upon his
declared intention to told it for, or transfer it to another or the grantor,
there is an implied trust in favor of the person whose benefit is
contemplated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Accordingly, the only rule that can
possibly have any relevance to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> situation,
instead of the Statute of Frauds, would be the <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence rule which, in any event, is not one of the grounds for dismissal of a
complaint, since it is a rule exclusively of admissibility of evidence and not
of any other branch of procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, under the known circumstances of this case, I even doubt very
much if the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> will be able to successfully
invoke the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule when the trial is
eventually held, for the simple reason that appellant, has <span style="">in </span>effect specifically alleged in his
complaint that the deed of sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was
subject to the condition already men­tioned that their illegitimate child would
be the real beneficiary thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
general rule of admissibility which excludes evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
tending to vary the terms of a written agreement is subject to the exception,
among others, that the same does not apply when the party wishing to prove the
real agreement or the additional terms specifi­cally alleges such agreement or
terms in his plead­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
stated, the matter of whether or not there is really an obligation on the part
of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to convey the land in question to her
child with <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is only one of proof, there be<span style="">in</span><span style="">g </span><span style="">no technical bar to
the evidence, much less <span class="GramE">to</span> appellant's action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, like the Statute of Frauds, the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule may not be used as a shield to commit
fraud with impunity, particularly, when, as in this case, it is alleged that an
implied trust is involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would even
go further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I venture to add that even
if this case were considered as one involving an express trust under Article
1443 of the Civil Code which provides that an express trust affecting realty
may not be proved by <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence, I would still
hold that appellant's case is subject to this exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fundamental principle underlying all
rules of proof that never may the same be utilized as instruments to conceal or
shield fraud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main opinion holds that the execution of the deed of
conveyance in favor of the appellant was a partial execution or consummation of
the agree­ment between appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> which
puts the enforcement of the obligation in question beyond the pale of the
Statute of Frauds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, the
predicate of said proposition is that the conveyance of the property in
question to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and her obligation to hold the
same only in trust for their illeg<span style="">itimate
child still unborn at that time constitute one sin</span><span style="">g</span><span style="">le
contract, albeit verbal, as I have al­ready explained above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, one part of the contract having
been complied with already by app</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">llant by executing the formal deed in favor
of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, the latter cannot now excuse <span class="GramE">herself</span> from com</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">lying with </span><span style="">her part of the bargain by invoking </span><span style="">the Statute of Frauds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, from whatever angle one views this c<span style="">ase, </span>most of all from the standpoint
of the inno­cent child begotten by the parties out of wedlock and whose future
seems <span class="GramE">uncertain,</span> the conclusion is inescapable that
the trial court erred in sustaining <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion
to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the proce­dural
technicalities now set aside, whether the pro­perty in question was indeed
intended by appellant <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to remain with <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
for her own benefit or to be in her name only temporarily for the benefit of
their child is the main question of </span>fact which by this decision the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> may now try and decide.</p>

This rule of evidence is commonly known as the <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its operation,
however, it excludes all kinds of evidence, whether oral, in writing or
otherwise, which tends to prove a term or condition not appearing in the
written agreement, if such terms or condition had been agreed upon before or
simultaneously with the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
this reason, I prefer to call the evidence barred by the general rule evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> rather than <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence, which is of­ten mistaken to refer only to evidence by word of mouth,
which, as already explained, is not <span style="">the
sense in which it is supposed to be <span style="">under</span>stood
in the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule.</span></p>
