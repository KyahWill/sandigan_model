R. No. 19873-Cr., People vs. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Gunay</span> y <span class="SpellE">Andreda</span>, promulgated on <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1978</st1:date>, affirmed the trial court's judgment
convicting him of homicide and damage to property through reckless imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of that decision was served on
defendant-appellant's counsel on <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="5">May
 12, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1978</st1:date>,
his counsel sent by registered mail to the Court of Appeals a motion for the
reconsideration of the said decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That fact was certified to by the <span class="GramE">postmaster</span> at
<span class="SpellE">at</span> the provincial capitol of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
(Annex C of petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies of that
motion, also sent by registered mail, were received by the Solicitor General's
Office and the Citizens Legal Assistance Office (Annexes D and E of the
petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the original motion was not attached to the record of
the case or could not be found in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the assumption that the judgment had
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, entry of judgment was
made in that case on <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record was remanded to the court of
origin on <st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in its resolution of <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1978</st1:date> (copy received by appellant on <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1978</st1:date>) denied the motion
of appellant <span class="SpellE">Gunay</span> for the setting aside of the entry
of judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The denial was based on the
ground that "no motion for reconsideration has been filed" by the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 15, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Gunay</span> filed in
this Court a petition praying that the Court of Appeals' resolution of August
28, 1978 be set aside and that, after a review of the Appellate Court's
decision, he be acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Gunay's</span> motion for
reconsideration is now attached to the record of CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No.
198730, having been received in the docket section only on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 28, 1978</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor
General recommends that <span class="SpellE">Gunay's</span> motion should be
resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the entry of judgment in the Court of Appeals was
made under an honest mistake of fact or under the erroneous assumption that <span class="SpellE">Gunay</span> did not file a motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the interest of justice, the resolution of
the Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="8">August 28,
 1978</st1:date>, denying <span class="SpellE">Gunay's</span> motion to set aside
the entry of <span class="GramE">judgment,</span> is hereby reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals is directed to cancel
the entry of judgment and to pass upon <span class="SpellE">Gunay's</span> motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clerk of court
of Branch II of the city court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City is
directed to elevate to the Court of Appeals within three days from notice the
record of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Gunay</span>, Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">II-112036.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
