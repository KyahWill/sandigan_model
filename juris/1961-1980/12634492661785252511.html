<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, considering the foregoing circumstances, and
following the rulings held by our Supreme Court in the cases of the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Nawasa</span>, G.R. <span class="GramE">No</span>. <span class="GramE">L-12032; City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>

judgment is hereby pronounced in favor of the plaintiff and against the
defendant, declaring the former as owner of the San Juan Waterworks System and
ordering the latter to render an ac­counting of the income derived by it from
Decem­ber 31, 1955, to the present, less the sum of P20,000.00, the cost of the
useful and necessary expenses introduced by it into the said system; or in the
alternative, the defendant may continue the ownership, possession, operation,
supervision and administration of the said waterworks system, after paying to
the plain­tiff the sum of P101,030.02, the value of the system, when it was
taken over by the defend­ant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No cost is
hereby assessed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff herein, the Municipality of San Juan, is a municipal
corporation, forming part of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to 1955, said plaintiff had constructed
its waterworks system, known as San Juan Waterworks, partly with insular aid
and partly with local and loan funds, and then operated it with a certificate
of public convenience granted by the Public Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In December, 1955, when the System was worth
P101<span class="GramE">,030.02</span>, more or less, the NAWASA, invoking the
provisions of Republic Act No. 1383,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
assumed control over said waterworks, excluding <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the plain­tiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the latter
commence the present action against NAWASA, to secure a declaration of unconstitutionali­ty
of said Act, upon the ground that it deprived plaintiff of its property,
without due process of law and without just compensation, as well as a judgment
sentencing NAWASA to re­linquish to plaintiff the possession, ownership,
control, supervision, operation and administration of the waterworks in
question and to render an account of the funds derived from its operation from
December 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appropriate
proceedings said court rendered the aforementioned decision, from which NAWASA
has taken the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">NAWASA does not question the wisdom of City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> vs. NAWASA,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

declaring Republic Act No. 1383 uncon­stitutional insofar as it provides for
the transfer to the Na­tional Government, through the NAWASA, of the ownership
of local waterworks system belonging to municipal corporations, without due
process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seeks, however, to
evade the effect of said decisions, by arguing that, as regards the waterworks
system involved in the case at bar, what has taken place is a transfer, <u>not</u>
of the <u>ownership or title</u> to said system, but merely, of its <u>possession,
administration and control</u>, and that such transfer of the latter is a valid
exercise of the police power of the State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, this pretense had al­ready been rejected in previous cases of
similar nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
vs. NAWASA,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
we declared:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<blockquote>"This Court has already overruled appellant's proposition that
Republic Act No. 1383, constitutes a valid exercise of police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have said (in the aforementioned three
cases, the issue raised by the instant appellant has been repeatedly decided by
this Court) the Act does not seek to merely trans­fer administration of the
property of a municipal corporation from one agency to another for purposes of
supervision and control; ownership and beneficial interest are also
conveyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It carries out a real transfer
of dominion over the waterworks to the new agency, the NAWASA."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The language used in <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>La Carlota</st1:placename></st1:place> vs. NAWASA<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
was:</p>

<blockquote>"It is hard to conceive how the jurisdic­tion, supervision and
control of the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> waterworks system may be
vested in the appel­lant without destroying the integrity of the <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> right of dominion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ownership is nothing without the inherent
rights of posses­sion, control and enjoyment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the owner is deprived of the ordinary and beneficial use of his
property or of its value by its being diverted to public use, there is taking
within the constitutional sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> &amp; Fernando, Constitution of the Philippines, 4th
ed., Vol. I, 215-216.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such deprivation
would be the certain consequence if, as prayed for by the appellant, it should
be allowed to assume jurisdiction, supervision and control over the waterworks
sys­tem of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be little less than an assumption
of ownership itself and not of mere administration."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What is more, in <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Compostela</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
vs. NAWASA,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court went further and postulated that:</p>

<blockquote>"The alleged sufficiency of Republic Act No. 1383 to justify
the action taken by the NAWASA has been overruled by this Court in City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> vs. NAWASA (57 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. 1584), City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> vs.
NAWASA, L-12892 (April 20, 1960), <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> vs.
NAWASA, L-18540 (November 29, 1963), and La Carlota vs. NAWASA, L-20232
(September 30, 1964), in which we held that the National Govern­ment can not
appropriate patrimonial property of municipal corporations without just
compensation and due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a consequence, neither may the National Government assume the power of
administration of patrimonial property of munici­pal corporations, if such
action is based upon the aforementioned appropriation of said property by the
State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it may not, by operation
of law, assume such administration, without appropriating the title to the
property, if the same or the income derived from its operation will be <span class="SpellE">comingled</span> with other property, either of the National
Government or of other municipal corpora­tions, in such a way to permit the use
of the pro­perty or income belonging to one of such corpora­tions (because it
was derived from the operation of its patrimonial property), for the benefit of
another municipal corporation or of the State itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(37 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. p.
700; 62 C.J.S., p. 348; 38 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. pp. 97-98; 103
A.L.R. p. 579.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We note that the decision appealed from grants NAWASA the option
to retain the ownership, possession, operation, supervision and administration
of the waterworks system of <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city>
upon payment of the sum of P101<span class="GramE">,030.02</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 1383 empowers the NAWASA to
purchase real and personal property, but, this authority is vested by section 3
of the Act in a Board of Directors, which does not appear to have chosen to
exercise it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the decision
appealed from does not fix the period within which the option may be availed
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, said decision or
portion thereof may pursuant to the doctrine laid down in Ignacio vs. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> <u>never</u>
<span class="GramE">became</span> final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision should, therefore, specify the
time within which the option may be exercised by the proper organ of the
NAWASA, which, we feel, should be six (6) months from entry of Judgment in this
Court.</p>
