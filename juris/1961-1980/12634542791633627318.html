				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">To secure a P5,000-loan obtained from the Philippine Bank of
Commerce, Vicente del <span class="SpellE">Fierro</span>, Luis de Leon, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span> and Working Press
Corporation, jointly and severally, signed and executed a promissory note dated
July 13, 1947 for the same amount, payable to the bank or its order, ninety
(90) days after date with 8% interest per annum which interest if not paid when
due, shall become part of the capital with the same rate of interest (<u style="">See</u> Art. 1959, Civil Code) and 25% of the
amount due as attorney's fees should a litigation arise.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1954</st1:date>,
the Philippine Bank of Commerce sued, before the Court of First Instance of
Manila, Vicente del <span class="SpellE">Fierro</span>, Luis de Leon, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span> and the Working
Press Corporation for the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,041.67</span>
allegedly due as of <st1:date year="1954" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1954</st1:date>,
plus 25% thereof as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering on <st1:date year="1954" day="10" month="6">June 10,
 1954</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span> denied liability and in a
cross-claim, alleged that he merely acted as guarantor of his co-defendants and
did not receive any centavo from the loan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rest of the defendants also answered; but finding that the
answer of said other defendants tendered no legal issue as it admitted the
material allegations of the com­plaint, the Court of First Instance, on
December 16, 1954, upon motion of the plaintiff and over the objection of <span style="color: windowtext;">defendant
<span class="SpellE">Colcol</span>, rendered a judgment on the pleadings as to
said other defendants, without prejudice to rendering a separate decision on <span class="SpellE">Colcol's</span> cross-claim, ordering these defendants, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>.,
excluding <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span>, to pay plaintiff P6,041.67 with 8%
interest from May 4, 1954 plus 25% attorney's fees.</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1957</st1:date>,
the date of hearing of the case against defendant <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span>,
neither he nor his counsel ap­peared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, plaintiff presented its evidence and the court on November
15, 1957 ordered <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span> to pay, jointly and severally
with his co-defendants, the amount still unpaid P4,535.90 with 8% interest from
March 15, 1950 plus 25% attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging mistake and excusable negligence consisting in the
failure of his lawyer's new clerk to bring to the lawyer's attention the notice
of hearing received September 2, 1958, as the clerk allegedly merely filed the
notice in the folio of the case, <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span> petitioned on
January 4, 1958<span style="color: windowtext;"> to set aside the court’s decision of November </span><span style="color: windowtext;">15, 1957.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of the petition for lack of merit and of his motion <span style="">for </span>reconsideration of such denial, <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span> ap­pealed to the Court of Appeals, alleging that he
was denied his day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 7, 1964, the Court of Appeals affirmed the appealed
orders of the Court of First Instance on the fol­lowing grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) <span class="SpellE">Colcol's</span>
petition to set aside the judgment, considered under Rule 37 of the Rules of
Court as <span style="">a </span>motion for new
trial, had an “affidavit of merits,” alleging the circumstances constituting
the supposed excusable negligence, <span style="">but </span>it
did not state facts showing a valid defense in case a new trial is granted; (b)
The fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence as a ground must be of
such a nature that ordinary prudence could not have guarded against it and by
reason of which, the aggrieved party has probably been impaired in his
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of <span class="SpellE">Colcol's</span> counsel to instruct his new clerk from the start
on a course of action as to papers <span class="GramE">received,</span> is not an
exercise of ordinary prudence and is inexcusable. Such instruction was given
only after the incident occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appealing to us from the decision of the Court of Appeals <span class="SpellE">Colcol</span> insists that he was not given his day in court and
claim substantial compliance with the rules regarding his affidavit of merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The duty rests on every counsel to see to it that there is
adopted and strictly maintained a system that will efficiently take into
account all court notices sent to him.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellants counsel should have been prudent enough to instruct his new clerk to
keep him notified of pleadings that reach his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="GramE">We</span> did not
consider <span style="color: windowtext;">as excusable negligence a lawyer's failure to appear in </span><span style="color: windowtext;">a
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">hearing due to the clerk's mistake of misfiling a notice of hearing
just received before he went off for a vaca­tion.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> <span class="GramE">Considering the facts and circumstances and the rule that a motion
for new trial rests on the sound discretion of the trial court.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;">
We find no error on the part of the Court of Appeals in affirming the lower
court's denial of such motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view
of the patent inexcusabi­lity of the ground alleged, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find it unnecessary to go into appellant's other point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby
affirmed, with double costs against appellant to <span style="">be </span>paid by his counsel.</p>
