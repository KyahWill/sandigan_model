First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in criminal case 8495
imposing the death penalty on Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Layson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Ragub</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Garces</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1964</st1:date>
when these four accused stabbed <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> to death, they were inmates of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Penal Colony serving sentences of conviction for the
following crimes:</p>

<blockquote>"Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Layson</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
kidnapping with robbery, homicide, homicide and theft;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Ragub</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- frustrated murder and homicide;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- robbery in an inhabited house and theft;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Garces</span><span style=""> </span>- robbery hold-up and robbery in an uninhabited
house."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the early morning of that hapless day, at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="16">4:45 o'clock</st1:time>, the four accused, armed with
bladed weapons, entered the cell where the unsuspecting victim, prisoner <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span>, was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Layson</span> locked the
door of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without warning and
acting in concert they then swiftly took turns in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They thereafter barricaded themselves,
refusing to surrender to the trustees who had come to the scene of the crime,
agreeing to surrender only to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Afurong</span>, the
supervising prison guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Afurong</span> arrived, identified himself, and assured them of
their safety, whereupon they handed their weapons through the hole of the
barricaded door and surrendered themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> died shortly after being brought
to the prison hospi­tal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death was
caused by severe internal and external hemorrhage and shock, all secondary to
multiple stab wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Layson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ragub</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span> admitted that they killed <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> because the latter urinated on their coffee cups a
number of times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Garces</span>
stated that he killed <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> because the latter spat
on him a week before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four plotted
to kill <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> a few days prior to the actual
slaying.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1964</st1:date>
all the accused were indicted for the crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information recites:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned accuses Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Layson</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Ragub</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Garces</span> of the crime of
Murder, under Art. 248, in rela­tion to Art. 160, of the Revised Penal Code,
com­mitted as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about January 17, 1964, in the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Penal Colony, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span>, Pro­vince of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Court, the above-mentioned accused, while then being convicts serving in the
said <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Penal Colony their corresponding sentences
of con­viction by reason of final judgment imposed upon them, conspiring and
confederating together and helping one another, armed with sharp-pointed ins­truments,
with treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, and with
intent to kill, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and fe­loniously attack, assault and stab with said weapons <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span>, their co-inmate in
the said Colony, thereby inflicting upon him serious injuries which caused his
death; with the aggravating circumstances of (1) recidivism with respect to the
accused Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Layson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ragub</span>, and (2) all of them with two or more prior
convictions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, all the four accused, assisted by counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, freely and spontaneously <u>pleaded
guilty</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the plea of
guilty, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> proceeded to receive testi­mony because
of the gravity of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1965</st1:date> the court rendered
its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond
reasonable doubt as principals of the crime of murder, defined and penalized
under Arti­cle 248 of the Revised Penal Code, with the mitigat­ing circumstance
of plea of guilty in favor of all of them and the aggravating circumstances of
recidi­vism and having been previously punished for two or more crimes to which
the law attaches a lighter pe­nalty with respect to the accused Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Layson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Ragub</span>, the aggravating circumstance of having been punished
with two or more offenses to which the law attaches a lighter penalty with res­pect
to the accused <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Garces</span> and
the aggravating circumstances consist­ing of any two of the qualifying
circumstances al­leged in the information which are treachery, evi­dent
premeditation and abuse of superior strength for one is sufficient to qualify
the crime to murder and the special aggravating circumstance of having
committed the crime charged while serving the pe­nalty imposed upon them for
previous offenses as regards all the accused and conformably with Arti­cle 160
of the Revised Penal Code, hereby sentences all of them to <u>DEATH</u>, to
indemnify jointly and se­verally the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> in the amount of Six Thousand Pesos
(P6,000.00) without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency by reason of
the penalty imposed and to pay the costs proportionately."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For the purposes of this review, suffice it to consider, on the
one hand, the aggravating circumstances of evident premedita­tion and treachery
and the special aggravating circumstance of <u>quasi-recidivism</u>, and, on
the other, the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reject the recommendation of the Solicitor General that the
mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation be consi­dered in favor of
all the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this circumstance
to exist, it is necessary that the act which gave rise to the obfuscation be
not removed from the commission of the offense by a considerable length of
time, during which period the perpetrator might recover his normal equanimity.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Three of the accused admitted that they harbored ill-feeling
against <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> because the latter urinated on their
coffee cups se­veral times, all these taking place at least ten days before the
ac­tual slaying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gasang</span>
spat on <span class="SpellE">Garces</span> a week before the day of the
killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the accused plotted to
kill <span class="SpellE">Gasang</span> a few days before <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the light of these circumstances, it is evident that sufficient time
had elapsed during which the accused regained their equanimity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They moved their evil scheme forward to con­summation
after obtaining weapons from their fellow inmates whose aid they had
solicited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">aforenarrated</span>
circumstances negate the presence of passion and obfuscation; upon the
contrary, they prove the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of evident
premedi­tation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery attended the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The necropsy report (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
I) and the diagram (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. J), plus the testimony of
Dr. Guillermo de Guzman, conclusively prove that the victim was killed in a
manner insuring utter suddenness and complete sur­prise in the execution of the
offense, with resultant incapability of the victim to offer resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there was abuse of superior strength
would suffice to qualify the crime to murder, but this cir­cumstance must be
considered as absorbed in treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery qualifies the killing to murder;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
evident premeditation becomes a mere generic aggravating circumstance<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which is offset by the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A qualifying circumstance not only gives the
crime its proper and exclu­sive name but also places the author thereof in such
a situation as to deserve no other penalty than that specially prescribed for
said crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The special aggravating circumstance of <u>quasi-recidivism</u>
(art. 160, Rev. Penal Code) was correctly considered against all the accused,
who, at the time of the commission of the offense, were undoubtedly serving
their respective sentences for previous convictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Quasi-recidivism</u> has for its effect
the punishment of the accused with the <u>maximum period</u> of the penalty
prescribed by law for the new felony, and cannot be offset by an ordinary mi­tigating
circumstance.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When they pleaded guilty to the charge of murder, all the accused
admitted all the material facts and circumstances alleged in the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime of murder is
punished with <u>reclu­sion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its maximum period to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the at­tendance of the
special aggravating circumstance of <u>quasi-recidivism</u>, this Court is left
with no alternative to affirming the death penalty imposed by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was error for the trial judge to consider against the ac­cused
the aggravating circumstance of having been previously pu­nished for two or
more crimes to which the law attaches lighter penalties because the said
aggravating circumstance of "<span class="SpellE">reitera­cion</span>"
requires that the offender against whom it is considered shall have served out
his sentences for the prior offenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here all the accused were yet serving their respective sentences at the
time of the commission of the murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concurrence in the grim view that we take of this case is given
by Attorney <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> Villegas, Jr., counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for the four accused, who unqualifiedly
recommends <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed a lethal hand that pens <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of a death sentence, but ours is the inescapable duty to enforce the inexora­ble
mandate of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> imposing the
death penalty on Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Layson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ragub</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jo­ventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Garces</span>, is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The indemnification to the heirs of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Regino</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Gasang</span>, is hereby increased to P12,000,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to be paid jointly and severally by the four accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</p>
