				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition to review the decision of the Court of Industrial
Relations dated <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1964</st1:date>
as well as its resolution dated <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="4">April
 20, 1964</st1:date>, the decisive issue is one of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 20, 1961 <span style="">Jolly
</span><span class="SpellE">Almin</span>, respondent here, and Marcos Vasquez,
both former employees of the P. <span style="">G. </span>Tomas
&amp; Co., <span style="">Inc., </span>filed separate
petitions with the Court of Industrial Relations for reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, recovery of salary differentials under the
Minimum Wage Law, and attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his petition - Case No. 1590-V - Jolly <span class="SpellE">Almin</span>
alleged that he worked for herein petitioner as laborer from April 1, 1957
until August 9, 1961,when he was abruptly dismissed without cause; that he
worked six days a week and was paid a daily wage of P2.00 from April 1, 1957 to
June 30, 1957; P2.50 from July 1, 1957 to September 30, 1957; P3.00 from
October 1, 1957 to March 31, 1958; P3.50 from April 1, 1958 to September 30,
1958; P4.00 from October 1, 1958 to May 31, 1959; and P4.25 from June 1, 1959
to August 9, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition filed by
Marcos Vasquez – Case No. 1589–V contained similar allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1961</st1:date>
P. G. Tomas &amp; Co. moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the ground
that each of the petitions involved only one work and that the <span style="">alleged dispute was not causing and was not
likely to cause a strike or lockout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon opposition of the
claimants the Court denied the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A subsequent motion for reconsidera­tion was
likewise denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Separate answers to the petition were then filed, alleging <span style="">that</span> the claimants were hi<span style="">r</span>ed only in 1958 and that <span style="">they voluntari</span>ly<span style=""> </span>resigned on <st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the C.I.R. rendered a joint decision on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="2">Fe<span style="">b</span>ruary
 12, 1964</st1:date>, denying reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
on ground <span style="">that </span>no union activity
was involved in the dismissals, but ordering, for reasons of equity and
justice, P. G. Tomas &amp; Co. to pay two months separation pay to the
claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim <span style="">for </span>differential pay was denied be­<span style="">cause the </span>subject-matter thereof was
below the statutory minimum wage and <span style="">therefore
</span><span style="">outside </span>the jurisdiction
of the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">P. G. Tomas &amp; Co.
thereupon </span>filed a motion for re<span style="">consideration
of that portion of the decision granting two months separation pay to each of
the claimants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The C.I.R., after
considering the two cases</span> sepa<span style="">­</span>rately
<u><span style="">en</span></u><span style=""> <u>banc</u></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">arrived at a tie vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both </span><span style="">cases </span><span style="">Judge Jose Bautista
(who penned the separate resolutions) and Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span> voted to deny the motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> dissented, with
Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Martinez concurring in the dissent, on
the ground that since the C.I.R. had no jurisdiction over the main petition it
also had no </span><span style="">jurisdiction </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">grant sepa­ration pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Ansberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> abstained from
voting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the request of the
C.I.R., the Secretary of Justice designated Judges Federico <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>
and Francisco Geronimo of the Court of First Instance to sit temporarily in the
C.I.R. in order to break the tie in the two cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Case
</span><span style="">No. 1589-V of claimant Marcos
Vasquez was assigned to Judge Federico <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span>, who
concurred in the dissenting opinion of Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>, holding that the C.I.R. had no jurisdiction over
the petition and in effect granting the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Judge Francisco Geronimo, who was given
Case No. 1590–V, voted to deny the motion for reconsideration therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time P. G. Tomas &amp; Co. filed this
appeal only with respect to Case No. 1590-V.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner, citing the
case of <u>Philipp</u></span><u><span style="">ine
Associa</span></u><u><span style="">tion of Free Labor
Unions versus Tan</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> maintains that the C.I.R. has no
jurisdiction to entertain the petition as well as to grant separation pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The jurisdiction of the
court must of course appear first of all in the petition or complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent allegation in the petition of
Jolly </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Almin</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">states
that he was abruptly dismissed from employment without any valid cause and that
from </span><st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">
to </span><st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1958</span></st1:date><span style=""> he was receiving wages below the minimum allowed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His prayer, as already observed, is for
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, salary differentials
and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apropos the aforesaid
prayer, two factors must be considered:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, this case comes within the purview of the Termination Pay Law
(R.A. No. 1052) under which the dismissal without just cause of an employee,
whose employment has no definite period, would not entitle him to reinstatement
but only to separation </span><span style="">pay.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Thus
a prayer for reinstatement is a useless plea if the petition does not show on
its face that the right to be reinstated exists, and would not be a material
consideration for purposes of vesting jurisdiction in the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Industrial Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second,
the claim for salary differentials refers to wages below the statutory mini­mum
and therefore constitutes a violation of the Minimum Wage Law which pertains to
the jurisdiction </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">regular courts, as distinguished from a claim
for salary differentials above the statutory minimum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <u>Magdalena
Estate, Inc. versus <span class="SpellE">Bangilan</span></u>, 7 SCRA 655, 657,
this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Is an action (1) <span style="">for </span>recovery
of underpayment under the Minimum Wage Law, and (2) for the recovery of
separation pay under Republic Act 1052, as amended by Republic Act 1787, within
the juris­diction of the Court of Industrial Rela­tions?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the first item, we are of the
opinion that the proper court before which the claim should be presented is the
Court of First Instance and not the Industrial Court, particularly where, as in
this case, there is no labor dispute involved and the claim pertains
exclusively to the past and has nothing to do with current wages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the claim for a separation or terminal pay by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Bautista, the same is not within
the jurisdiction of the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so ruled in the case of
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Luisita</span> Estate v. <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>
Alberto, et al., G. R. No. L-12133, <st1:date year="1958" day="31" month="10">Oct.
 31, 1958</st1:date>, where we said:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Alberto's petition, after relating the dates of employment
and separation, merely complained that ‘they were re­moved summarily or
separated without jus­tifiable cause.’ It described no other concurring or
qualifying incidents or data in connection with the removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The controversy was therefore, a matter not
within the scope of the power of the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regardless of the
question of jurisdiction, the petitioner disputes the right of respondent <span class="SpellE">Almin</span> to the separation pay awarded to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground for such award, as stated in the
decision of respondent court, is that "while it is the prerogative of an
employer to terminate the employment of employees, especially where there is no
definite agreement as to their tenure, yet for reasons of equity and justice,
such prerogative could not be exercised </span>by any employer as to ignore or
deprive what little right is left to its employees of this category, such as
prior notice provided by law."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing statement is correct as a general rule, and in fact
is in accordance with Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No.
1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
evidence shows that respondent <span class="SpellE">Almin</span> voluntarily
resigned from his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His letter
resignation, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1961</st1:date>,
and marked as Exhibit 1, was written after he was implicated by one of his
co-workers in the theft of some<span style=""> </span>equipment
belong­ing to the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument
on this point in the brief for the petitioner has not been rebutted, respon­dent
<span class="SpellE">Almin</span> having filed no brief in reply.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations the <span style="">judg</span>ment appealed from is reversed,
and the complaint dis­missed, without costs.</p>
