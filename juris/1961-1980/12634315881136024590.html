of the reversal made by the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission of the
award issued in petitioner's favor by the Workmen's Compensation Section, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City Sub-regional Office, Department of Labor, on
her claim for compensation benefits for the death of her husband, <span class="SpellE">Bagay</span> Caleb, a construction helper employed by respondent
Republic (Bureau <span class="GramE">of</span> Public Highways, Mountain Province
Engineering District).</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 3, 1974, the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City
Sub-regional Office received petitioner's notice and claim for death benefits
under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the claim alleging that petitioner's
husband, <span class="SpellE">Bagay</span> Caleb, died on December 10, 1971, as a
result of an injury received sometime in March, 1970 when he was hit by a big stone
while working on one of the roads of <span class="SpellE">Otucan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bauko</span>, Mt. Province.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notice of petitioner's claim was received by the Bureau of Public
Highways, Mt. Province Engineering District on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1974</st1:date> as evidenced by the Registry Return
Receipt attached to the records of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The records do not reveal that
the respondent Republic (Bureau of Public Highways) filed its notice to contro­vert
the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a Motion to Dismiss
dated September 9, 1974 was filed by the Office of the Soli­citor General for
the respondent Republic contending, among others, that (1) it had no prior
knowledge of the injury allegedly suffered by the deceased until the filing of
said notice and claim for compensation, which was beyond the periods prescribed
by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, thereby barring further
proceedings on said claim; and that, (2) the supposed injury was not
service-connected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Without resolving the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
Motion to Dismiss and without notifying the Republic of a hearing on the claim,
the Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Section, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City Sub-regional Office, found merit in the claim and issued an award in favor
of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Calingan</span> Caleb in the amounts of (1)
Four Thousand Six Hundred Eighty Pesos (P4<span class="GramE">,680.00</span>) as
compensation benefits equivalent to forty-five (45%) <span class="SpellE">Percentum</span>
of decedent's average weekly wage for 208 weeks under Section 12 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, and (2) Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00), as
reimbursement of burial expenses, and ordered res­pondent Republic to pay the
administrative fee of Forty-seven Pesos (P47.00).</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the award was filed by the Office
of the Solicitor General but the same was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the entire record of the case was
elevated to the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission for review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On review, the Workmen's
Compensation Commission dismissed the claim for lack of merit in the following
wise and manner, thus -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After a careful examination of the entire records, we cannot
but conclude that the herein claimant has miserably failed to establish her
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No suffi­cient evidence was
presented or submitted by the claimant to establish, at least, some causal
connection of the knee injury that <span class="SpellE">Bagay</span> Caleb
sustained allegedly some­time in March, 1970 with his work causing his
disability for labor, and that said injury led to his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of his leave of absence after the
alleged incident to prove that he was disabled for labor was not presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was the death certificate submitted
to estab­lish the facts of death, and from which the cause that led to his
demise could be ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
the marriage contract and the affidavit of dependency as evidence of claimant's
relationship to the deceased and of her dependency on him for <span class="GramE">support,</span> were not submitted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Much as we sympathize with the claimant in this case, we cannot
decide it in her favor as the evidence on record does not justify an
award." <span class="GramE">(Decision of WCC, p. 2).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence, this petition for review by petitioner.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough perusal of the records of the case, <span class="GramE">We</span> reverse the decision of the respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission sought to be reviewed, and thus reinstate the award of
death benefits and burial expenses granted to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Calingan</span>
Caleb by the Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Section, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City Sub-regional Office in his Order dated <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In deciding adversely against the compensability of petitioner's
claim on the ground that petitioner failed to substantially establish her case,
the Workmen's Compensation Commission committed a grave error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find as clearly established the fact that
the injury, alleged to be the cause of death of petitioner's husband, is
service-connected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the
records is the Phy­sician's Report of Sickness or Accident accomplished by Dr.
Edgar N. <span class="SpellE">Rapisora</span> of the Mt. Province Provincial
Hospital, clearly stating the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that upon examination, <span class="SpellE">Bagay</span> Caleb had an old
fracture dislocation on the right knee joint (Item 4); that the cause of injury
was a "fall while working on the road due to and in pursuance of the
employment (Items 7 &amp; 8); that the injury resulted in permanent total
disability for labor (Item 21); that the injured limb had already developed
great impairment of movement and normal function (General Remarks).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, since petitioner's evidence clearly
established the causal connection between the injury alleged to be the cause of
death, and the deceased's employment, it then devolved upon the employer (the
Repub­lic) to show by substantial evidence that the injury and death of
petitioner's husband was not so service-connected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so because petitioner, as
claimant, enjoys in her favor the legal presumption of the compensability of
her claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, by virtue of
said presumption, which the respondent Commission once again ignored so
blatantly, petitioner need not be required to establish her case by substantial
evidence, for precisely, the purpose of such presumption is to dispense with
proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, respondent
Republic as employer, required by law to overcome by substantial evidence said
presumption, failed to discharge the burden laid by the law on its door.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier in <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision, the
records do not reveal any timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> made
by the respondent Republic after receipt of the notice of the claim on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if <span class="GramE">We</span> were to
consider the Motion to Dismiss filed by the Office of the Solicitor General as
a <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim, the fact still remains
that the said motion was filed only on <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the filing
thereof was beyond the 10-day period after receipt of the notice of claim
within which an em­ployer must file its notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
under Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, by failing to controvert the claim
within the time pres­cribed by Section 45 of the above Act, and by its failure
to have its right to controvert reinstated, the employer (Republic) is deemed
to have waived its right to inter­pose any non-jurisdictional defenses, and
could not prove anything in relation thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, the compensability of the present claim, its
reasonable­ness and validity are now beyond challenge; in effect, an ultimate
admission of liability.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the outright award in favor of petitioner-claimant was properly
issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rule 9, section 1 of the
Workmen's Compensation Commission Rules expressly provides for the outright
issuance of an award "where liability is admitted by the employer"
and in <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Republic maintains that it was deprived of its
right to due process as the award was issued without having been notified of
the hearing on the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is devoid
of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>Security
Services Unlimited, Inc. vs. WCC, et al</u>., 69 SCRA 269, this Court, thru
Justice <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> said:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"When petitioner
failed to comply with the aforementioned requirement of the law (Section 45 of
Act 3428), by its own act, </span>it waived its right to controvert the claim,
hence with its presumed knowledge of the law, it voluntarily waived its right
to due process (hearing and presentation of evidence to prove its
defenses).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has nobody to
blame but itself for its failure to controvert the claim on time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court, declaring that it is a well-settled rule in this
jurisdiction that failure to controvert a claim on time also means waiver of
the right to due process, cited the following authorities:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dangue</span> vs. Franklin

<p class="BODY">We reiterate the same rule in the instant petition and so hold

Act, not having been <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> nor overcome by
substantial evidence, must be granted.</p>
