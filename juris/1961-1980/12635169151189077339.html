				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The problem posed in this, an original petition for certiorari,
is whether or not this Court in the exercise of its supervisory powers should
strike down as having been issued in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse
of discretion, the respondent judge's order of June 15, 1966 in Civil Case 8873
(Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) directing
petitioner to deliver to Special <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>
Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> of the estate of the deceased
Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> the North Forbes Park property
hereinafter described, and to refrain from disturbing or interfering in any
manner whatsoever with the latter's possession thereof, such order having been
amended by said respondent judge's subsequent order of June 28, 1966 in turn
enjoining defendants in said case (private respondents herein) and/or their
duly authorized agents or representatives from selling, disposing, or otherwise
encumbering said property in any manner whatsoever pending the termination of
said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We granted the writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction prayed for and directed respondents to return
the possession of the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> property to petitioner upon a
P50<span class="GramE">,000</span>-bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling facts are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="7" day="13" year="1965">July 13, 1965</st1:date>,
herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
sought in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Branch, her appointment first as Special <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> and then as regular <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate of Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> who died in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> on <st1:date month="7" day="7" year="1965">July 7,
 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is known in the
record as Special Proceedings 1944-P.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner there alleged that the deceased Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
had lived with her continuously, openly and publicly as husband and wife for
nineteen (19) years:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from 1946 to 1964
at 1951 Taft Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, and from 1964 to
July 1965 at 60 <span class="SpellE">Russel</span> Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City; that the deceased who died without a will left an estate consisting of
personal and real properties situate in­ the Philippines, <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
and other places with an estimated value of about P500,000; that to
petitioner's knowledge and information, the deceased left three daughters,
Virginia <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, Mary <span class="SpellE">Yap­tinchay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eligir</span> and Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>,
all of age; that on July 7, 8 and 11, 1965, certain parties carted away from
the residences aforesaid personal properties belonging to the deceased together
with others exclusively owned by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was averred that in these circumstances the appointment of a special
administrator to take custody and care of the interests of the deceased pending
appointment of a regular administrator became an urgent necessity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing allegations, the court issued on July 17, 1965
an order appointing herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate of the deceased Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yap­tinchay</span>
upon a P25,000-bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the petition of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, an opposition was registered by Josefina Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, the alleged legitimate wife, and Ernesto Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> and other children, of the deceased Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, upon the ground that said <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Yap­tinchay</span>, not being an heir of the decedent,
had no right to institute the proceeding for the settlement of the latter’s
estate, much less to procure appointment as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
thereof; and that having admittedly cohabited with the deceased for a number of
years said petitioner was not qualified to serve as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
for went of integrity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time,
<span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> counter-petitioned for the appointment of
Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, daughter of the deceased, as
special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> and of Josefina Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, the alleged surviving spouse, as regular <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To give <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> an opportunity to be
heard, the probate court, on <st1:date month="7" day="19" year="1965">July 19,
 1965</st1:date>, set aside its order of <st1:date month="7" day="17" year="1965">July 17, 1965</st1:date> appointing petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1965</st1:date>,
after the parties were heard, the probate court granted counter-petitioners'
prayer and named Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> upon a P50<span class="GramE">,000</span>-bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="18" year="1965">August 18, 1965</st1:date>,
the special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> submitted a preliminary
inventory of the assets of the estate of the deceased Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Included
amongst these was "[a] bungalow residential house with swimming pool,
situated at Park corner <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>
  Road, North</st1:address></st1:street> Forbes Park, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>"
adverted to at the start of this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was after respondent Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
had been appointed special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> that herein
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
made her second move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was on <st1:date month="8" day="14" year="1965">August 14, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, petitioner filed in another branch
(<span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Branch) of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> an action for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> and
for liquidation of the partnership supposedly formed during the period of her
cohabitation with Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> and for
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case was docketed as Civil
Case 8873.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Pending hearing on the question of the issuance of the writs of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> and preliminary injunction prayed for, respondent
judge Guillermo E. Torres issued an order of August 17, 1965 temporarily
restraining defendants therein (private respondents here) and their agents from
disposing any of the properties listed in the complaint and from interfering
with plaintiff's (herein petitioner's) rights to, and possession over, amongst
others, “the house now standing at North Forbes Park, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 25, 1965, defendants (private respondents herein)
resisted the action, opposed the issuance of the writs of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
and preliminary injunction, mainly upon these propositions; (1) that exclusive
jurisdiction over the settlement of the estate of the deceased Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> was already vested in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City Branch in the special proceedings heretofore mentioned (Special
Proceedings No. 1944-P); (2) that the present liquidation case was filed to
oust said probate court of jurisdiction over the properties enumerated in this,
the second case (Civil Case 8873); and (3) that plaintiff was not entitled to
the remedy of injunc­tion prayed for, her alleged right sought to be protected
thereby being doubtful and still in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said defendants (private respondents before this Court) in turn
prayed the court for a writ of preliminary injunction to direct plaintiff
(petitioner here) and all others in her behalf to cease and desist from
disturbing in any manner whatsoever defendant Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay's</span>
possession amongst others of the North Forbes Park house and to order the
removal from the premises of said North Forbes Park house of the guards, agents
and employees installed therein by plaintiff; to enjoin plaintiff and her
agents from entering the aforesaid house and any other real property registered
in the name of Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> and from
interfering with or from disturbing the exercise by Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> of her rights and powers of administration over
the assets registered in the name of Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
and/or in the latter's possession at the time of his death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Came</span> the herein disputed order of <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1966</st1:date> issued in said Civil
Case 8873, the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"From the pleadings as well as the evidence already submitted
and representations made to the court during the arguments, it appears that one
of the properties in dispute is the property located at the corner of Park Road
and <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> Street, North Forbes Park, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Risal</span> which at the time
of the death of the deceased Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> was
still under construction and it also appears that after his death said property
was among the properties of the deceased placed under the administration of the
special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, the defendant Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Information has been given that in the evening of <st1:date month="8" day="14" year="1965">August 14, 1965</st1:date>, the plaintiff was able to
dispossess the special <span class="SpellE">ad­ministratrix</span> from the
premises in question and that since then she had been in custody of said house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the Court is still considering the merits of the application
and counter application for provi­sional relief, the Court believes that for
the pro­tection of the properties and considering that the Forbes Park property
is really under the respon­sibility of defendant Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, by virtue of her being appointed Special <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> of the estate of the deceased Isidro <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, the Court denies the petition for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary injunction of the plaintiff with respect to the Forbes
Park property and the restraining order issued by this Court is lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court also orders the plaintiff to cease and
desist from disturbing in any manner whatsoever the defendant Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> in the possession of said property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, upon defendant's filing a bond in the amount of
P10,000.00, let a writ of prelim­inary injunction issue requiring the
plaintiff, her representatives and agents or other persons acting in her behalf
to deliver the possession of the prop­erty located at the corner of Park Road
and <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> Street, North Forbes Park, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to the Special <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>,
and to refrain from disturbing or interfering in any manner whatsoever
defendant's possession thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Which, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, was amended by the court order of <st1:date month="6" day="28" year="1966">June 28, 1966</st1:date>, which in part recites:</p>

<blockquote>“Considering that the present case treats principally with the
liquidation of an alleged partnership between the plaintiff and the deceased
Isidro <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> and considering further that said
house in North Forbes Park is included among the properties in dispute, the
Court hereby clarifies its Order of June 15, 1966 by enjoining the defendants
and/or their duly authorized agents or representatives from selling, disposing
or otherwise encumbering said property in any manner whatsoever pending the
termination of this case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion to reconsider the <st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1966">June 15, 1966</st1:date> order was overturned by respondent judge's
order of <st1:date month="8" day="8" year="1966">August 8, 1966</st1:date>,
which recites that:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that defendants, principally Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, <u>took actual</u> or <u>physical</u> <u>possession</u>
of the said properties which were formerly held by the deceased Isidro <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> and the plaintiff, <u>by virtue of her
appointment</u> and under her authority, as Special <span class="SpellE">Adminis­tratrix</span>
of the estate of the deceased Isidro <span class="SpellE">Yap­tinchay</span>, the
plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration is hereby denied."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The orders of June 15 and <st1:date month="8" day="8" year="1966">August
 8, 1966</st1:date> triggered the present proceedings in this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's stance
before us is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she was occupying
the <st1:place><st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>
property at the time of the death of Isidro <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>,
grave abuse of discretion attended respondent judge's order issuing an injunctive
writ transferring possession of said property to respondent Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A rule of long standing echoed and reechoed in jurisprudence is
that injunction is not to be granted for the purpose of taking prop­erty out of
possession and/or control of a party and placing it in that of another whose
title thereto has not been clearly established.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
With this as guidepost, petitioner would have been correct if she were lawfully
in possession of the house in controversy when Civil Case 8873 (where the injunctive
writ was issued) was commenced in the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> court, <u>and</u>
if respondent special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, to whom the
possession thereof was transferred, were without right thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the situation here is not as petitioner
pictures it to be.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is beyond debate that with the institution on July 13, 1965 of
Special Proceedings 1944-P, properties belonging not only to the deceased
Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> but also to the conjugal partner­ship
of said deceased and his legitimate wife, Josefina Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
were brought under the jurisdiction of the probate court, properly to be placed
under administration.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
One such property is the lot at <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> house, petitioner offers
varying versions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the verified
petition before this Court, peti­tioner avers "that the construction of
said <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> prop­erty was undertaken
jointly by petitioner and the deceased, peti­tioner even <u>contributing</u>
her own exclusive funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This is a reproduction of an allegation in petitioner's <st1:date month="6" day="27" year="1966">June 27, 1966</st1:date> alternative motion for
reconsideration or for clarification/amend­ment of the herein <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> order of <st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1966">June 15, 1966</st1:date> in Civil Case 8873.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And again, in the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> dated August 3, 1965, she spoke of the
acquisition of properties, real and personal, in her own words, "through
our <u>joint</u> <u>efforts</u> <u>and</u> <u>capital</u>, among which
properties are those situated" in "North Forbes Park."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
All of which contradict her averment in the amended complaint dated October 25,
1965 - also verified - in said Case 8873 to the effect that she "acquired
through her own personal funds and efforts real properties such as x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the house now standing at
North Forbes Park, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But herein private respondents vehemently dispute petitioner's
claim of complete or even partial ownership of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that the construction of that
house was undertaken by the deceased Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
without her (petitioner's) intervention and that the deceased paid with his own
personal funds all expenses incurred in connection with the construction
thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was only after hearing and considering the evidence adduced
and the fact that after the death of Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
the <st1:place><st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>
house "was among the properties of the deceased placed under the
administration of” respondent Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>,
that re­spondent judge issued the injunction order of <st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1966">June 15, 1966</st1:date> herein complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worth repeating at this point is that
respondent judge, in his order of <st1:date month="8" day="8" year="1966">August
 8, 1966</st1:date>, declared that defendants (private respondents herein),
"principally Virginia Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, took <u>actual</u>
or <u>physical</u> possession", amongst others, of the North Forbes Park
house - "<u>by virtue of her appointment</u> and under her <u>authority</u>,
as Special <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span>.”</p>

<p class="BODY">On this score, petitioner herein is not entitled to the injunc­tion
she prayed for below.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As well established is
the rule that the grant or denial of an injunction rests upon the sound
discretion of the court, in the exercise of which appellate courts will not
interfere except in a clear case of abuse.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A considerate and circumspect view of the facts and circumstances
in this case obtaining will not permit us to tag the disputed order of <st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1966">June 15, 1966</st1:date> with the vice of grave
abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite true
that, in support of the allegation that the house in <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was her exclusive property, peti­tioner presented proof in the form of loans
that she had contracted during the period when said house was under
construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But evidence is wanting
which would correlate such loans to the cons­truction work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, there is much to the
documentary proof presented by petitioner herself which would tend to indicate
that the loans she obtained from the Republic Bank were for pur­poses other
than the construction of the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, we gather from pages 17 to 18 of
petitioner's memorandum before this Court; and the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, Annex A
thereof, which states in its paragraph 4 that she obtained various loans from
the Republic Bank "for her own exclusive account" and that the
proceeds thereof "were also used by affiant both for her business and for
the construction, completion and furnishing of the said house at North Forbes
Park", and which cites her seven promissory notes in favor of Republic
Bank, Appendices 1 to 7 of said affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not one of the promissory notes mentioned reveals use of the proceeds
for the construction of the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Forbes</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, there is Appendix 2, the
promissory note for P54,000 which says that the purpose of the loan is for
"Fishpond development"; Appendix 3 for P100,000 for the same purpose;
Appendix 5 for P50,000, "To augment working capital in buying &amp; selling
of appliances &amp; gift items"; and Appendix 7 for P1,090,000, "For
Agricultural Development".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In plain
terms, the fact alone of petitioner's indebtedness to the Republic Bank does
not establish that said house was built with her own funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the context just recited that the unsupported assertion
that the North Forbes Park house is petitioner's exclusive property may not be
permitted to override the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> presumption that that
house, having been constructed on the lot of Isidro Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptin­chay</span>
(or of the conjugal partnership) at his instance, and during the existence of
his marriage with respondent Josefina Y. <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>,
is part of the estate that should be under the control of the special <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can petitioner's
claim of ownership presumably based on the provisions of Article 144 of the
Civil Code be decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Article 144
says that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When a man and a woman
live together as husband and wife, but they are not married, or their marriage
is void from the beginning, the property acquired by either or both of them
through their work or industry or their wages and salaries shall be governed by
the rules on co-ownership."</p>

<p class="BODY">But stock must be taken of the fact that the creation of the
civil relationship envisaged in Article 144 is circumscribed by conditions, the
existence of which must first be shown before rights provided <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> may be deemed to accrue.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
One such condition is that there must be a clear <u>showing</u> that the
petitioner had, during cohabitation, really contributed to the acquisition of
the property involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until such right
to co-ownership is duly established, petitioner's interests in the property in
controversy cannot be considered the "present right" or title that
would make available the protection or aid afforded by a writ of injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
For, the existence of a clear positive right especially calling for judicial
protection is wanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Injunction,
indeed, is not to protect contingent or future rights;<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
nor is it a remedy to enforce an abstract right.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it would seem to us that the interests of the
parties would be better safeguarded if the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
North Forbes Park property be in the hands of the bonded <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
in the intestate proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For then,
her acts would be subject to the control of the probate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding no error in the disputed orders of respondent judge, the
herein petition for certiorari is hereby dismissed, and the writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
