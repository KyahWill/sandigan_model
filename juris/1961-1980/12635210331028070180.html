				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a verified complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> against Atty. Pedro K. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span>,
the latter was charged with malpractice in connection with his professional
conduct as the complainant's counsel in Civil Case No. 2250 of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, such malpractice having
given rise to the rendition of judgment against said com­plainant and his wife
ordering them:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
restore the ownership and possession of the property described under paragraph
2 of the <span style="">complaint to </span>the
plaintiffs herein; to demolish or transfer the house they built in the land
within a pe­riod of three months counted from the re­ceipt of this decision at
the expiration <span style="">of which, if they shall
fail to remove the house from the land in question, the plain­tiffs shall be
authorized to remove it at the expense of the defendants; to pay the plaintiffs
in the amount of (300.00) three hundred pesos for attorneys' fees; for damages,
to pay the </span><span style="">plaintiffs the </span><span style="">amount of P1,800.00 which is the estimated
value of the produce of the land in question from 1951 up to the present year
which the plaintiffs failed to take advantage of due to their being
dispossessed of the aforementioned land; and, to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no adequate evidence to support
the claim for moral damages, no such damages are adjudged."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, the respondent admitted some of the
allegations thereof and denied the others, <span style="">and, by way of affirmative defenses, alleged the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent was admitted a member of
the Philippine Bar in 1939 which is now a fifth of a century since his taking
his oath as attorney and counselor-at-law; he was appointed to the Judiciary as
Justice of the Peace Court of Palo, Province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
in 1949, remaining as such until 1954 - the <span style="">date </span>when he resigned to continue his prac­tice of law; in 1957,
he (respondent) was again appointed as Justice of the Peace Court, this time in
his home town at <span class="SpellE">Tolosa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>;
remaining as such until he resigned in 1958 to accept the position as Assistant
Adminis­trative Officer in the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Congress of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During all
the <span class="GramE">years</span> that he was actively practicing his noble
profes­sion, he has never been nor will he in the future, <span style="">be a </span>renegade to this noble
profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his actuations as a
Justice of the <span style="">Peace </span>Courts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first at Palo, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
then at <span class="SpellE">Tolosa</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>,
his records are his eloquent proof of his being a missionary of justice;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it is true that the respondent was
engaged by the petitioner to be their counsel in the case entitled "FERMIN
NATIVIDAD, ET AL., versus VALENTIN AVELINO, ET AL.," docketed as Civil
Case No. 2250 of the <span style="">Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> where </span>the petitioner is one
of the defendants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent verbally advised the
petitioner of the hearing of the afore-stated case on November 15, 1957, at
8:30 o'clock in the morning at least <span style="">three
days </span>be­fore <span style="">the scheduled </span>hearing
when the petition­ers called on <span style="">the </span>respondent
at the latter's residence which the former <span style="">were </span>used to do as admitted by him in paragraph 4 of the com­plaint
as that is their understanding to enable them to confer;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That when the scheduled hearing of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case on November 15, 1957, at 8:30 o'clock in
the morning arrived, the respondent failed to be <span style="">present in court </span>or appear thereat be­<span style="">cause:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"at about 3:00
o'clock in the </span>morning of that day, I had a severe stomach ache followed
by constant moving of bowel and <span class="SpellE">vomitting</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence I became very weak and I <span style="">felt </span>that I was about to die," as
shown by a medical cer­tificate which is attached to the "motion <span style="">for new trial" filed by the </span>respondent,
<span style="">hereto </span>attached as an integral
part here­of and marked as Annex "A";</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That when the respondent received a copy of
the decision in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
entitled "<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>,
et al., versus <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>,
et al., <span style="">he </span>filed a "motion
for new trial" already marked as Annex "A" hereof, wherein the
respondent explained his failure to ap­pear on the date of the hearing of said
case on November 15, 1957, at 8:30 o'clock in the morning;</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1958" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1958</st1:date>, the herein respondent filed an
"amended motion for new trial" where, in <span style="">addition to the reasons recited by </span>him in his motion for new
trial he stated that:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"x the evidence of the defendants in this case at bar
consisting of their adverse, continuous <span style="">and
peace­</span>ful possession of the property in question for almost twenty
years, payment of land taxes, fraud commit­<span style="">ted in the part of the plaintiffs </span>herein and <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
in the part of the plaintiffs are very strong; and that if the defendants are
given their day in court to present their <span style="">evidence,
the findings and conclu­</span>sions of the Honorable Court <span style="">might </span>be made in <span style="">favor of the </span>herein de­fendants and
adverse <span style="">to the plain</span>tiffs;"</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">or</span> another way of
alleging that the defend­ants have a good and valid <span style="">defense; said "</span>amended motion for new trial is hereto at­tached
as Annex "B" and made an integral <span style="">part hereof;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the failure of the defen­dants to appear
in court when their case was set for hearing on November 15, 1957, at 8:30
o'clock in the morning despite the verbal notice to them by the herein
respondent is not until the present known to herein respondent;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
when the herein respondent was appointed Administrative Officer in the Office
of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Congress of the Philippines,
sometime in March 1958, he already advised the petitioner to look for another
lawyer to represent him."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issues having been thus joined, the case was referred to the
Office of the Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the evidence
presented by the parties the Solicitor General submitted his report, the
portion of which under the title "ANALYSIS" reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing facts, this Office finds the respondent
guilty of negligence on the following counts:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span> did not
duly inform his client of the date of the trial sched­uled for <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1957</st1:date> when the evi­dence
shows that he received notice of such hearing on <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1957</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the motion for new trial on <st1:date year="1958" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1958</st1:date> was made out of time,
exactly 40 days after the decision was received on <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay in the filing of the said motion
remains unexplained in the record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña's</span> 2nd
motion for new trial, after the Court had afforded him all the opportunity to
plead his motion successfully, was denied by the lower court on the ground that
he failed to comply with an order of the court dated February 1, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the <span style="">said </span>motion was duly filed on time, a previous order of the
Court directed the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span>)
to serve a copy of his amended motion to the other party through counsel, but
compliance therewith does not appear <span style="">on
the said motion (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The testimony of petitioner is not clear as to whether respondent
was responsible in hiring Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aristidis</span> de la Paz
to take over the case after the decision had become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we can allow such a doubt to be
resolved in favor of the respondent's claim that he suggested to his client
that he contract Atty. De la Paz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Office believes that although petitioner had verified the
petition for relief from judgment dated March 18, 1958 filed by Atty. De la
Paz, petitioner here­in did not exactly comprehend, due to his patent
illiteracy, what he was signing <span style="">in </span>alleging excusable negligence on the part
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span> for failing to notify him and his
co-respondents in Civil Case No. 2250 of the date of the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further­more, we are fully aware of the
practice that practicing attorneys usually prepare such petitions for their
clients to sign.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Office however believes that the non-appearance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span> at the hear­ing of <st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1957</st1:date> has been satisfac­torily explained by
the verified medical certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we
do not share the same view insofar as his negligence in failing to notify his
clients of the date of hear­<span style="">ing </span>is
concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the findings contained in the above-quoted
portion of his report, the Solicitor General found the respondent "guilty
of negligence in the performance of his duties as a member of the Bar" and
consequently recommended "that he be suspended from the practice of law
for at least six months."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, following the procedure provided by the Rules of
Court in cases of the same nature, the Office of the Solicitor General filed
with this Court the corre­sponding complaint based on the findings of fact
contained in his report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In respondent's
answer thereto he repro­duced the defenses set forth in his answer to the
verified complaint filed by the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="GramE">We</span> set the case for hearing
but, in­stead of arguing the case orally, the respondent submit­ted a written
memorandum, while the Office of the Solic­itor General did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration of the whole record, We find no sufficient
justification to reverse the finding made by the Office of the Solicitor
General to the effect that respondent "did not duly inform his client of
the date of the trial scheduled for November 15, 1957" in spite of the
fact that, according to the evidence, he had re­ceived notice of such hearing
four days before.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards respondents failure to appear in court on the day set
for the trial, We are inclined to accept his claim that it was due to the fact
that early in the morning of that date he had "a severe stomach ache,
followed by constant moving of bowel and <span class="SpellE">vomitting</span>
and that as a consequence he became very weak." But while this might be,
to a certain extent, a good excuse for his non-appearance in court, it is
obviously not sufficient to explain his failure to notify his clients in due
time of the date of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had he
done so, his clients would probably have tried to contact him in due time, and
upon discovering that he was sick they would have either gone to court to ask
for the postponement of the trial, or they would have looked for another lawyer
to represent them in court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then again <span class="GramE">We</span> find no sufficient exculpatory evi­dence for respondent
filing a motion for new trial "out of time," exactly forty days after
notice of the decision rendered by </span>the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, although he was given an <span style="">opportunity to file a second motion for new
trial, it </span>appears that the <span style="">same
was denied by the court "on the ground that he had failed to comply with
its previous order dated </span><st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February 1, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this connection, <span class="GramE">We</span> reproduce hereunder the pertinent
portion of the report submitted by the Solicitor General:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The said decision was received by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span>
on <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is admitted by him in his second motion
for new trial (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">I).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span>
</span>filed his motion for new trial <span style="">dated
</span>December 26, 1957 on January 7, 1958, 40 days after receipt of judgment
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> motion for new trial was op­<span style="">posed </span>by the attorney for the
plaintiffs on the grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the motion
for new trial is not the proper remedy; (2) that the motion was not accompanied
by affidavits or affidavits of merits (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An</span> amended motion
for new trial was subsequently filed dated <st1:date year="1958" day="18" month="1">January 18, <span style="">1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, attaching thereto an </span><span style="">affidavit </span><span style="">executed by </span><span style="">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On</span> </span><span style="">the same date, January 18, 1958, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City </span>ordered the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
"to serve a copy of his amended motion, <span style="">if </span>he so desires to amend his motion, to the other party through
counsel, Atty. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Suddrio</span>, not later than the
25th of January so that the latter may file a reply if he so desires." On <st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1958</st1:date>, another order was
issued by the Court giving Atty. <span class="SpellE">Palaña</span> one week's
time within which to present another amended motion <span style="">for </span>new trial (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A</span> subsequent
amended motion for new trial was filed on <st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1958</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> said motion for
new trial was however de­nied on the same date for "not having com­plied
with the order of this court dated <st1:date year="1958" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1958</st1:date>" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="">J)."</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
