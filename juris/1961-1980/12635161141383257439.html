				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It was in 1923 when Vicente del Rosario started to work with the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co. in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was a laborer, then a sweeper in the com­pany's machine shop
department, then a <span class="SpellE">scaler</span> and later a centrifugal
operator in its boiling house department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1930 he was made a river pump operator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Installed in the river pump house in Central <span class="SpellE">Manapla</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, are two diesel motor pumps, each
sup­plied with big pipes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These pumps
suck water from the riv­er which is then coursed by pressure thru the pipes to
the sugar mill site and buildings of the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pipes are provided with screeners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Vicente oiled, lubricated, cleaned and tended these pumps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He worked in different shifts, sometimes from
7 a.m. to 3 p.m., at other times from 3 to 11 p.m., and often on the graveyard
shift, that is, from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. the facing day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His job required him to dive or go under
water one to four <span class="SpellE"><u>brazas</u></span> deep three times a
week -- five times a night in case of flood -- to clean the pipes and screeners
that got clogged with dirt.</p>

<p class="BODY">He was hospitalized in September 1953 at the St. Joseph's
Hospital in <span class="SpellE">Manapla</span>, a hospital owned and maintained
by the company, for minimal pulmonary tuberculosis, and from August 26 to
September 9, 1954, again for the same disease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then resumed work, but had to stop two weeks afterwards because of a
"backache." The company separated him from the service on August 25,
1955, on account of "pulmonary tuber­culosis," and he was paid a
gratuity of P2,717.34.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When se­parated
from his employment, he was earning P4.24 a day.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 19, 1960 he filed a claim for compensation
(RO-7-WC-786) with the Regional Office in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City against the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 7 the
latter filed an "Employer's Re­port of Accident or Sickness" and
other papers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The hearing officer, on February 28, 1964, rendered a decision
finding that the "claimant's sickness could either have been aggravated by
or was the result of the nature of his employment", adjudging the claimant
entitled to compen­sation under section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended, and ordering the company</p>

<blockquote>"To pay to claimant through this Office the sum of THREE
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FOUR PESOS AND 48/100 (P3,704.48); and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To pay to this Office the total sum of THIRTY EIGHT PESOS
(P38.00) pursuant to section 55 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 27, 1965 the Workmen's Compensation Commis­sion, on
review, affirmed the decision of the hearing offi­cer <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, and further adjudged the company to pay
"the additional sum of P5.00 as cost of this review".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The com­pany's motion for reconsideration was
denied by the WCC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on December 14, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present recourse.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The company contends that the WCC erred in enter­taining
the claim for compensation which was filed almost four and a half years (January
19, 1960) after the claim­ant's separation from the service (August 25, 1955),
in violation of section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, which
sets the maximum period of two months for the filing of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is not a new one; as many
times as it has been urged we have re­jected it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We emphatically ruled in <st1:place><u>Rio</u></st1:place><u>
y <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, et
al.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
reiterating the doctrine previously expounded in many cases, "that failure
to comply with the requirements of section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act<span style="">&nbsp; </span>--that is, the giving of no­tice and
the filing of a claim within the time prescribed in said section -- is
non-jurisdictional."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The WCC likewise did not err in holding that the
com­pany's failure to file its employer's report and notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> within ten days after knowledge of the
accident, as required by paragraph 2 of section 45 of the Workmen's Com­pensation
Act, as amended, amounted to statutory renunciation of its right to assert non-jurisdictional
defenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The com­pany filed its employer's report and notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
only after it was asked to do so by the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
Regional Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the argument that an employer is required to submit an
"Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness" only in case of <u>"injuries</u>"
* * * in the course of their employment, as provid­ed in sections 37 and 44 of
the Act, and in case of "accident" under section 45 of the Act, and
the herein claimant's "sick­ness" did not arise out or as a result of
"injuries" or "acci­dent", suffice it to point out that
paragraph 2 of section 45 speaks of "accidents" and
"disability", and the disability of an employee or laborer may be due
to sickness, that is, to causes other than "injuries" or "accidents".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, section 39 (c) of the Act defines
"injury" or "personal injuries" to include
"sickness".</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That the claimant was afflicted with
tuberculosis as early as September 1953, is conclusively proved by (1) the
"Radio Physical Therapy Record" dated September 10, 1953 of the St.
Joseph's Hospital in <span class="SpellE">Manapla</span>; (2) the "Treatment
Re­cord" of the claimant, also of the same hospital; and (3) the
"Physician's Report of Sickness and Accident", submitted by the
company to the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Regional Office on March 7,
1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company disagrees with the Commission's conclusion that the
claimant's sickness "was contracted * * * during the period of his
employment", contending that this is not sup­ported by the evidence on
record, and arguing that tubercu­losis is not an "occupational
disease."</p>

<p class="BODY">We have read the decision of the WCC, and we find no reason to
disturb its findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote with
approval the following excerpts from the decision:</p>

<blockquote>"It is safe to conclude that said
illness was con­tracted by the claimant during the period of his employment,
since he underwent the physical and medical examinations conducted yearly by
the company on its employees and was found fit for work; it was only in
September, 1953 when upon x-ray examination he was found afflicted with said
PTB disease. * * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The nature and the conditions under which the claimant worked
must have had adverse effects on his health.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had to go into the cold water especially when on night duty, three
times a week; and when there is flood, as many as five times dur­ing the night
to clean the screeners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The working
conditions were far from favorable to his health since his place of work (pump
house) continuously exposed to the heat emanating from the water pumps he was
tending, and to the heat caused by the gal­vanized roofing of the <span class="SpellE">pumphouse</span> when working in the day shift, not to mention the
fact that, prior to being a pump tender, he had been in constant exposure to
the heat emanating from the furnace or oven of the Boiling House department of
res­pondent while working therein as a <span class="SpellE">scaler</span> and sub­sequently,
as a centrifugal operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
claimant was frequently assigned to night work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Night work has a debilitating effect on one's physical constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the
nature and the conditions under which claimant worked had, evidently, adverse
effects on his health gradually lowered his body resistance against the
infection of tuberculosis germs deemed pre­sent in him in a dormant form."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We have consistently refused to reverse
or modify the find­ings of fact made by the WCC<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
on the ground, here urged by company, that there is testimonial evidence on
record con­trary to the said findings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The WCC findings in the present case are supported by <span class="SpellE">substantal</span> evidence on record and are therefore binding
upon us.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, while tuberculosis "is an infections di­sease,
attributable solely to the tubercular bacilli * * *, it is recognized that any
factor which lowers the resist­ance of an individual or brings injury to the
lung struc­ture will render him susceptible to tubercular infection, and so it
is true occupational diseases frequently termi­nate in tuberculosis".<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The obvious conclusion we can draw from the environmental circumstances in the
case at bar is that the claimant's sickness was contracted during the course of
his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature and
conditions of his work had a debilitating effect on his physical constitution.
Whether he did not have tuberculosis or had an arrested case of it at the time
of his employment, his work either served to reacti­vate the disease or
constituted its original cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
either case, he is entitled to compensation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>
