				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for certiorari and prohibition, with
preliminary injunction, against respondent, Hon. Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>,
as Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, to stay the execution of a decision of said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of said petition and of the
posting and approval of the requisite bond, we issued the writ of preliminary
injunction <span class="GramE">prayed</span> for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many years ago, a strip of land - commonly known as the MRR Lot - in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
had been reserved for a right-of-way of the Manila Railroad Company -
hereinafter referred to as the Company - in connection with a proposed
extension of its railroad line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending
implementation of the proposed extension, several people squatted on the MRR
Lot, and, when the line was eventually abandoned, a scramble for the possession
of portions of the <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> ensued among the squatters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein respondent Juana F. <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span> and one Faro <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span>
had conflicting claims to the possession of a portion known as Lot No. 24-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting as arbiter thereon, the Company
granted permission to <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span> to build north of a
path dividing said Lot No. 24 A and to <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span> to
build south of said path. </p>

<p class="BODY">This, notwithstanding, <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span>
constructed his house north of the path, in view of which <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span>
filed, against him, Civil Case No. 743 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, an <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span> to recover possession of the northern
portion of Lot No. 24-A, as well as damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In due course, judgment was rendered on <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1960</st1:date>, sentencing <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span>
to vacate said portion and remove his building thereon, as well as to pay <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span> the sum of P500.00, as attorney's fees, in
addition to the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cabading</span> sought a review of this decision by the Court of
Appeals, but while the appeal was pending before the latter, he sold his
aforementioned house to herein petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Bernarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span>, who thereafter introduced additional improvements
thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Company, which claimed ownership over the MRR Lot,
dealt with the former squatters as its tenants and collected rentals <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> until the year 1954, when it stopped its
collections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later, heeding a
clamor from the occupants of said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> for a direct sale
of the portions occupied by them, on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="5">May
 28, 1963</st1:date>, the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
passed a resolution declaring that the MRR Lot is a public land, disposable
through <span class="SpellE">townsite</span> sales applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the Company had failed to
establish its claim of title to the MRR Lot, on <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1964</st1:date> a body designated as "<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Coordination Committee"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
recommended to the Director of Lands that the lot be subdivided and its actual
occupants allowed <span class="GramE">to file</span> "the proper public land
application." Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span> applied for
the purchase of the area on which his house was and, upon its sale to
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bernarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span>,
the latter took over and pursued the application.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="11">November
 9, 1964</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
had affirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
in its Civil Case No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>743, and upon the
remand of the records thereof to the lower court, then presided over by Judge
Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span>
moved, on March 4, 1965, for the execution of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1965</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span>
filed Civil Case No. 1497 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
against respondent <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span>, to stay said execution,
upon the ground that the <span class="GramE">land</span> in question is the
object of an application of <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span>, whose interest
had been conveyed to petitioner, then being processed by the Bureau of
Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span>
filed in Case No. 743 an opposition to <span class="SpellE">Catbagan's</span>
motion for execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opposition
was, on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1965</st1:date>,
overruled by respondent Judge, who then ordered the is­suance of the writ prayed
for by <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On or about <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="3">March 24,
 1965</st1:date>, the Director of Lands filed a motion to intervene in case No.
1497, but before the motion was acted upon, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span> instituted
the present action against Judge <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> and <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At an
auction sale held on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="11">November 11,
 1965</st1:date>, the disputed area was awarded to peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span>, and on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="2">February
 9, 1966</st1:date>, Original Certi­ficate of Title No. P-566, covering said
area, was issued to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question for determination in this case is whether or not the
judgment in Civil Case No. 743 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, which is final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
ordering <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span> to vacate the land in question and
remove his building thereon, as well as to pay sums of money to respondent <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span>, may be executed against herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span>, as successor-in-interest of <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span>,
despite the subsequent sale of the land by the Government to <span class="SpellE">Nazal</span> and the Torrens title to said land issued in her
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although once a decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
it is the ministerial duty of the proper court to order its <span class="GramE">execution,</span>
this rule is subject to exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is well-settled that when, after a judgment has become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, facts and circumstances transpire
which render its execution impossible or unjust, the interested party may ask a
competent court to stay its execution or prevent its enforcement.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the stay of execution of a final judgment for a sum of
money has been sanctioned to give the judgment debtor an opportunity to set off
a money claim that had subsequently accrued in his favor and against the
judgment <span class="GramE">creditor,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></span>
or where the indebted­ness or obligation arising from said judgment had been <span class="SpellE">novated</span> by subsequent agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">More directly in point is the case of Hernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Clapis</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> a
forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case in which a decision
was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the decision was affirmed by the
Supreme Court, the execution thereof was objected to upon the ground that,
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal before said Court,
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources had rejected the sales
application of the plaintiffs and allowed the defendants to purchase the land
in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reversing the order of
execution issued by the lower court, we said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
While the decision in the forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case is final, <u>it can<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no longer be
executed at least in so far as<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
possession of the land in question is concerned</u>, because, under section 4 of
Commonwealth Act No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>141, the Director
of Lands has direct executive control of the survey, classification, lease,
sale or any other form of concession or disposition and management of the lands
of the public domain, and his <u>decisions as to questions of fact are conclu­sive
when approved by the Secretary of Agriculture</u>; and because the latter had
already cancelled the right of plaintiff Maria L. Hernandez to administer the
land in question and rejected both her sales application and that of her
husband, plaintiff Antonio Hernandez, at the same time giving the defendants
the preferential right to apply for said land in virtue of the provisions of
Republic Act No. 65.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correctness of
the final decision of the Secretary of Agriculture is not herein involved, but <u>it
is valid and binding until reversed in a proper proceeding by the court</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation is not that the judgment in the
forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case has lost its <span class="SpellE">virtuality</span>, but that <u>the plaintiffs had subsequently
ceased to be entitled to the relief awarded by said judgment</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, <u>the money <span class="SpellE">judgement</span></u>
in favor of the plaintiffs not being within the scope of the administrative
control granted by law to the Director of Lands with reference to public <span class="GramE">land,</span> <u>may still be enforced by execution</u>."
(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This view was adhered to in <span class="SpellE">Realiza</span> vs.

of judgment</u>, his homestead application was approved by the Director of
Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this supervening event

impossible or unjust, the interest­ed party may ask the court to modify or
alter the judgment to harmonize the same with justice and the facts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For this reason, in <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> vs. Judge

execution inequitable</u>; or when it appears that the controversy has never
