to the office of the Provincial Fiscal, Fiscal Abaca supposedly conducted a
preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first

questions which were suggested by Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> to
Fiscal Abaca <span style="">in </span>his letter to
him <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '1'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the investigation of <span style="">the
prosecution witnesses, the </span>accused were investigated also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigation was made hurriedly <span style="">on the </span>understanding of the
investigating Fiscal that they <span style="">were
under </span>custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
showing at all whether they waived their rights to Section 125 of the Revised
Penal Code or not to warrant an immediate preliminary inves­tigation without
giving the <span style="">accused the chance to
prepare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the </span>Fiscal, in
the opinion of the Court, Was of the notion that the investigation made in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
was sufficient as could be gleaned from the telegram <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

before Fiscal <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alviar</span></span><span style=""> </span>in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and their <span style="">affirma­tion </span>thereof
under oath was duly taken down in writing before the fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused chose not to raise any defense
nor adduce any evidence to exculpate themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the ques­tions asked by the
fiscal of the prosecution witnesses and the accused "were the very
questions which were suggested by Fis­cal <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> to
Fiscal Abaca, in his letter to him, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">'1’", i.</span>e. to affirm the truth
and correctness of their previous statements, did not affect the validity and
regularity of the investigation proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where a witness or accused has previously given a statement, it is a perfectly
valid procedure often availed of to avoid needless waste of time to just ask
him whether he affirms the same statement and the truth and correctness of the
contents thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To require the
investigating fiscal to repeat the same questions asked of, and answered by,
the complaining witnesses and the accused in their previous testimonies before
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>, as the lower court would apparently
indicate as the appropriate procedure would have served no useful purpose <span style="">nor </span>added a whit of evidence as to the
reasonable probability of the guilt of the accused, for purposes of the filing
of the <span style="">informa­</span>tion, in the
light of their statements admitting their apprehension <u>in <span class="SpellE">flagrante</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span></u> for
possession of <span style="">the untaxed cigarettes,
which statements remain <span class="SpellE">unrepudiated</span> by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no basis, therefore, for the lower
court's finding that the investigating fis­</span>cal had failed to
substantially comply with the requirements of <span style="">Rule 112, section 14 </span>of <span style="">the
Rules </span>of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower Court's
finding that "there is no showing at all whether (the accused) waived
their rights to Section 125 of the Re­<span style="">vised
Penal Code or not to warrant an immediate preliminary in­vestigation without
giving the accused </span>the <span style="">chance </span>to

case there is that element of expediency. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If <span style="">we </span>will

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Investigation of persons in custody</u>.
-- Where </span>the accused is detained without <span style="">a warrant </span>for <span style="">his arrest,
he may ask for a </span>preliminary investigation <span style="">by </span>a proper officer in accordance with the preceding sections, but
he must sign a waiver of the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding such
waiver the investigation must be terminated within seven (7) days from its
inception.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the case has already been filed in court and no preliminary
investigation has been conducted by the fiscal because the accused has not made
the waiver referred to in the preceding paragraph, the accused may, within a
period of five (5) days from the time he learns of the filing of the
information, ask for a reinvestigation thereof with the same right to
cross-examine the witnesses against him and adduce evidence in his favor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The immediate and "hurried" investigation conducted on
December 19, 1964 by the investigation fiscal in Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span>,
con­sidering that the accused were under detention by virtue of their lawful
arrest on December 13, 1964 was but in compliance with the requirements of the
above-quoted rule.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But assuming that the
lower Court had correctly found that there was no waiver by the accused of the
provisions of Sec­tion 125 of the Revised Penal Code, neither would it have
been justified in dismissing the information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For Rule 112, section 15 expressly authorizes the fiscal to immediately
file the case in court against a detained person arrested without a warrant,
without conducting a preliminary investigation, where the accused has not made
such waiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right granted by the
Rule to the accused in such cases is "<u>within a period of five (5) days</u>
from the time he learns of the filing of the information, (to) ask for a
reinvestigation thereof with the same right to cross-examine the witnesses
against him and adduce evidence in his favor."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, the accused failed to do, for the
information <span style="">against them was </span>filed
<span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="12"><span style="">December </span>19, 1964</st1:date>
and they <span style="">did not ask for such reinvestigation
within a 5-day period thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower Court <span style="">erred in choosing to believe against the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> sworn testimony of the investigating fiscal
that the information was prepared on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="12"><span style="">December 16, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, three days before it was actually
subscribed and filed with the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
refused to believe the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> explanation that the

x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> because if it was

occur frequently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <span style="">any </span>rate, this was a mere triviality
which <span style="">was of no relevance to the
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Information was not com­plete
until it was subscribed together </span>with the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">fiscal's</span></span><span style=""> sworn certi­fication on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="12"><span style="">December </span>19, 1964</st1:date>, <span style="">the date when the preliminary in­</span>vestigation
was conducted", as held by the Court itself in its Order.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court finds also
that the procedure adopted by the lower court of placing the investigating
fiscal on the witness stand and subjecting him to cross-examination by defense
counsel was highly improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from
the sworn certification in the information by the investigating fiscal that he
had duly conducted a preliminary investigation, the entire record <span style="">of the investigation </span>with the sworn
statements of the <span style="">complaining witnesses
and the accused had been </span>presented to the <span style="">Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower Court may </span>have
had its reasons for directing questions to the fiscal to sa­tisfy itself that
the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> rights had been duly safeguarded, such
as giving them a chance to cross-examining the complaining witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to have the fiscal placed on the witness
stand and have the defense counsel cross-examine and argue with him on points
of law, as to whether the affirmation by the arresting offi­cers and the
accused of their previous testimonies without retak­ing them was sufficient
compliance with the Rules of Court and impertinent questions as to whether
"the statement of the <u>Philippine Navy</u> as complainant" was
taken, was uncalled for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">lower </span>Court disregarded the
presumption that official duty has been regularly performed<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">and the well-settled rule that when nothing
appears affirmatively on the record that a prelimi­nary investigation was not
in </span>fact held, an objection on the <span style="">ground </span>of denial or deprivation thereof deserves scant consideration
by virtue of the presumption that both the court as well as the prose­cution
proceeded in accordance with law.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, defense counsel must first
overcome the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty <span style="">and present strong <u>prima facie</u> evi­dence
</span>of irregularity or falsification of the investigating <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> certification <span style="">and </span>record of the investigation for the Court to deny them the
faith and credence properly due them.</p>

<p class="BODY">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A final word on the
summary nature of preliminary in­vestigation proceedings seems appropriate, in
order to obviate the recurrence of these cases, where the State's efforts at <span style="">great </span>expense and zeal to thwart
traffickers in smuggled goods who undermine the national economy are frustrated
by a distorted view of the nature and purpose of preliminary
investigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The late Mr. Justice
Jose P. Laurel, speaking for this Court <span style="">in
</span>1941, placed the role and object of preliminary investigations in proper
perspective, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Its oft-repeated purpose is
to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious, and oppressive prosecutions,
and to protect him from open and public accusa­tion of crime, from the trouble,
expenses and anxiety of a public trial and also to protect the State from
useless and expensive prosecutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
new Rules were drafted in the light of the Court's experience with cases where
preliminary investigations had dragged on for weeks and even months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court had intended to remove this clog
upon the judicial machinery and to make a preliminary investigation as simple
and as speedy as is consistent with the substantial rights of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The investigation is advisedly called
preliminary, to be followed by the trial proper</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The investigating judge or prosecuting
officer acts upon probable cause and reasonable belief, not upon proof beyond a
reasonable doubt</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The occasion is
not for the full exhaustive display of the Parties' evidence; it is for the
presentation of such evidence only as may engender well-grounded belief that an
offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When all this is fulfilled, the accused
will not be permitted to cast about for fancied reasons to delay the proceed­ings;
the time to ask for more is at the trial</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
