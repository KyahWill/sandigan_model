				<H3>MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, PETITIONER VS. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 24, 1958, the Manila Electric Company was, upon its application, 
authorized to place a firm order and to install and operate at its Rockwell 
Steam Plant in San Pedro, Makati, Rizal, an additional electric generating unit 
with a 60,000 KW capacity, complete with boiler and other accessories, by the 
Public Service Commission. On December 18, 1958, the PSC handed down an order 
requiring the MERALCO "to pay to the Commission within thirty (30) days from the 
date of its receipt of this order the sum of P27,346.80 as permit fee 
authorizing the increase of capacity of its electric plant based on the 
additional investment of P27,346,800.00 at the rate of P0.10 for each one 
hundred pesos (P100.00) or fraction of said additional investment".
<p>Under date of December 29, 1958, the MERALCO presented a motion for 
reconsideration 6f the above order, contending that the requirement to pay the 
permit fee is contrary to law, particularly Section 40 of the Public Service Act 
(CA 146), as amended by Com. Act No. 454. The motion was denied on September 11, 
1959; hence this appeal.</p>
<p>There is no question of fact involved. The only issue presented to Us is "the 
legality of the imposed permit fee of P27,346.80 by the PSC."</p>
<p>Petitioner's argument in objecting to the imposition of the fee is centered 
on Section 40 of the Public Service Act, as amended by Com. Act No. 454, which 
provides—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 40.—The Commission is authorized and ordered to charge and collect from 
any public service the following fees:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"(g) For each permit authorizing the increase of equipment, the installation 
of new units or authorizing the increase of capacity, or the extension of means 
or general extensions in the services, ten centavos for each one hundred pesos 
or fraction of the additional capital necessary to carry out the permit.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"All collections of fees provided in this section shall be covered into the 
Philippine Treasury. This article shall not be applicable to the Commonwealth of 
the Philippines nor to its instrumentalities, nor to enterprises that have 
legislative franchises for the exercise of which the law specifies the payment 
of a certain per centum of their earnings in lieu of any other taxes, fees, or 
license fees."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the other hand, the State contends that while the franchise of 
petitioner exempts it from the payment of taxes and assessments, it does not 
exempt it from the payment of fees; and that there is a great difference between 
taxes and assessments on one hand and fees on the other (Manila Electric 
Company, <i>contra</i> El Auditor General y la Comision, 73 Phil. 128-142).</p>
<p>The petitioner argues that it is not claiming exemption from paying the 
permit fee under its franchise; that the exemption is claimed under the law (CA 
No. 146, as amended by CA No. 454), the pertinent provision of which states: 
"This article shall not be applicable to * * * enterprises that have legislative 
franchises for the exercise of which the law specifies the payment of certain 
per centum of their earnings in lieu of any other taxes, fees, or license fees"; 
and that the distinction between 'taxes' and 'fees' in the case cited by the 
State, is irrelevant to the resolution of the instant appeal, so that an 
extended disquisition thereon is deemed superfluous. Under the above arguments, 
petitioner submits that as it already pays 5% of its earnings for the exercise 
of its legislative franchise, it is exempted to pay the permit fee, because 
paragraph 9 of its franchise (as amended), provides that the 5% shall be "<i>in 
lieu of all taxes and assessments </i>of whatsoever nature and by whatsoever 
authority upon the privileges, earnings, income, franchise, and poles, wires, 
transformers and insulators of the grantee, <i>from which taxes and assessments 
the grantee is hereby expressly exempted</i>".</p>
<p>It is true that petitioner seeks exemption under section 40 of the Public 
Service Act, as amended by CA No. 454, but it is no less true that said Act 
<i>makes reference</i> "to enterprises that have legislative franchises for the 
exercise of which the law specifies the payment of a certain per centum of their 
earnings in lieu of any other taxes, fees or license fees", like the herein 
petitioner. In the interpretation or construction of the real meaning and intent 
of the said act, we should, therefore, take into consideration the provisions of 
petitioner's franchise. Petitioner's legislative franchise, as amended, 
specifies the payment of 5% of its earnings and expressly exempts applicant from 
the payment of taxes and assessments. The franchise limits the exemption to the 
payment of taxes and assessments. It does not exempt the petitioner from the 
payment of fees. If the intention of the lawmakers was to include permit fees, 
it could have easily done so. It is presumed that the lawmakers are familiar 
with the distinction between taxes (assessments or 'impuestos') and fees 
(derechos) (Manila Electric Co. vs. El Auditor General y la Comision de 
Servicios Publicos, 73.Phil., 128-142). The exemption from the payment of fees 
not having been expressly granted in the petitioner's legislative franchise, 
which is a special law governing its operation, the doubt should be, as it is 
hereby resolved in favor of the grantor of the privilege, here the State, and 
strictly against the party claiming exemption. Whoever claims exemption must be 
able to justify his claim by the clearest grant of organic or statute law. An 
exemption cannot be permitted to exist upon vague implication (C. Borja vs. 
Coll. of Int. Rev., 113 Phil., 568; See also Coll. vs. Manila Jockey Club, Inc. 
98 Phil., 670; 53 Off. Gaz; 3762; Song Kiat Chocolate Factory vs. Central Bank, 
102 Phil., 477; 54 Off. Gaz; 615).</p>
<p>In view hereof, the decision appealed from, being in accordance with law and 
the evidence, is affirmed, with costs against petitioner.</p>
<p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes J. B. L.,</i> 
and <i>Dizon, JJ.</i>, concur.</p></div>
