Hence, the trial proceeded only as against the accused Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bingco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the alleged extra-judicial confession of the accused,
the case for the prosecution rests mainly on the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutang</span>, widow of the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Manigos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">She testified that about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1966</st1:date>,
while she, her husband and their children were sleeping in their house at <span class="SpellE">Blocon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>, she heard three shots
coming from their yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After waking up
her husband, she saw a man standing by the window, who thereafter entered their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside the house, he shot
her husband and then pointed his pistol at her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, their door was opened, and
immediately, two men entered their house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of <span class="GramE">them,</span> posted himself by the door, which
was only three (3) fingers length away from a lighted bottle lamp, whom she
recognized and later identified as the accused Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bingco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter ordered her husband to lie prone
upon the floor, while his two companions tied his hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing a black shirt with the aid of his
flashlight, the accused Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bingco</span> tied the feet
of her husband with it, and said to his companions "go ahead."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">His two companions then entered their room and brought out their
trunk, which they forcibly opened with a hunting knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After ransacking its contents, one of the two
men, took her inside the room, pointed his hunting knife at her face, and then
said, "You just had a recent sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tell me where the proceeds of the sale <span class="GramE">is</span> or if
not I will thrust this knife on your face." She replied that she had
already spent the money but the man demanded from her the balance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then searched her body, and finding no
money in her person he threatened to burn their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then took a bottle of kerosene, and after
placing it near the feet of her husband, he scattered the corn around and tied
her feet and that of her daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the while, the accused Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bingco</span> remained
standing by the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they
went to drink water and washed their hands, and then left their house carrying
a bundle.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When the robbers had left their house, she untied her husband,
and with the help of their neighbors, they carried him in a hammock to <span class="SpellE">Matanao</span> for medical treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he died along the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So they brought her husband's body to her
mother's house.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bingco</span> denied any
participation in the commission of the crime, and repudiated his alleged extrajudicial
confession, claiming that he was maltreated by the police of <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
and some of the answers to the questions propounded to him were not his answers;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and that he signed the alleged confession on the promise of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Duhaylungsod</span>, the police investigator, that he will be made
a government witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In addition, he interposed alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
claims that on the evening of August 29, 1966 from 8:00 o'clock to midnight, he
was at the house of one Gregorio Madrid at New <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, listening
to the radio with the family of the latter, and that since he went to live in
New <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in 1965 and up to the present, he had never gone to <span class="SpellE">Blocon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected the claim of the accused, and convicted
him but only with the crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> held:</p>

<blockquote>"The court, however, concurs with the position taken by the defense
that the crime of robbery in band with homicide could not <span class="GramE">lie</span>,
first, the offended party declared that only 3 robbers committed the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a crime to be committed in
band it is essential that more than 3 persons participated in the act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore considering, the dismissal of the charge against <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Robles and <span class="SpellE">Dionesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabe</span> certainly, the crime could not be robbery in band,
but mere robbery with homicide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the accused is hereby sentenced pursuant to Art. <span class="GramE">294 of the Revised Penal Code to suffer the penalty of <u>Reclusion

<blockquote>"He is likewise ordered to indemnify the offended party in the

deceased in the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, with no subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency by reason of the penalty imposed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused being a detention prisoner is hereby credited

<p class="BODY">Hence, the accused interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issues to be resolved in the instant appeal is
whether or not the herein appellant has been positively identified by the
prosecution' s only eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutang</span>, and whether or not the alleged extra-judicial
confession of the appellant was voluntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, this Court will desist from disturbing the
conclusions of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, in deference to
the rule that the lower court, having seen and heard the witnesses and observed
their demeanor and manner of testifying, is in a better position to appreciate
the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this doctrine
must bow to the superior and immutable rule that the guilt of the accused must
be proven beyond a reason¬≠able doubt, because the law presumes that a defendant
is innocent, and this presumption must prevail unless overturned by competent
and credible proof.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The prosecution failed in that task.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the identity of the accused as
the person who committed the crime is essential to conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
As was held by this Court in <u>People vs. Beltran</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
the identity of the offender, like the crime itself, must be proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have carefully and patiently
gone over the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutang</span>, and after doing so, <span class="GramE">We</span>
confess that We are not certain that she had positively identified the herein
appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, We would like to point out that contrary to the
observations<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Solicitor General, the said witness for the prosecution never testified
that it was the herein appellant whom she first saw to be the man outside the
window, who thereafter entered their house and shot her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did she testify that she recognized
the said man.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The only part of her testimony which would suggest or imply that it was the
herein appellant who shot her husband is the question propounded by the Fiscal
and the answer given by the said witness quoted here¬≠under:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
your husband was tied on his feet by that person who shot him, what was he
doing after he tied your husband by the feet and hands?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
he tied my husband he said "go ahead."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The part of the question which states:
"While your husband was tied on his feet by that person who shot him"
has no probative value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not the
testimony of the witness but that of the Fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not impressed by the said witness' testimony that she was
able to recognize the appellant because at the time of the incident there was a
lighted bottle lamp, which was only three (3) fingers length away from the
place where the appellant was standing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If there was such a lighted bottle lamp, it is highly unbelievable that
the appellant would just stand there like a statue and expose his face to the
light to enable his victim to identify and recognize him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The natural reaction of a person who commits
robbery under such situation is to put out the light or to move away <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> in order to conceal his identity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, if there was indeed such a lighted
bottle lamp and the light coming <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was
sufficient to illuminate the place, as observed by the Solicitor General, then
the said witness could have recognized the two companions of the appellant who
ransacked the contents of their trunk; she could have recognized the man who
shot her husband and who pointed his pistol at her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of that, the said witness declared
that she did not recognize the two companions of the appellant because "it
was nighttime" and that "she did not see very clearly."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, after analyzing the testimony of the said witness, We
believe that she did not have ample opportunity to see and observe the face of
the appellant, because after the robbers had entered their house, she and her
deceased husband <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Manigos</span>,
were ordered to lie prone upon the floor,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
and while thus lying face down, her attention was focused on the two companions
of the appellant who were ransacking the contents of their trunk, and thereafter
she was taken by one of the robbers inside the other room of their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the said witness could not have
positively recognized the herein appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the identification of the appellant by the said witness
inside the office of the Chief of Police is unreliable and inconclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Duhaylungsod</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>
Police who investigated <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutang</span>
testified on cross-examination that before the identification, he informed the
said witness that they had already apprehended the person involved in the
robbery, that he was already in jail and that his name was Santiago <span class="SpellE">Bingco</span>, whom she would identify in the office of the Chief
of Police, together with six (6) other persons.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Such statements might have unduly influenced the said witness in pointing to
the appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the said witness did
not know the appellant before the incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
If she had therefore recognized the appellant she must have some bases for recognizing
him, like for example, his height, physical build, style of hair and wearing
apparel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said witness, however,
failed to furnish the police authorities a physical description of the
appellant - a very essential and important detail in the solution of the crime
and in the early apprehension of the culprit or culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore strange how the said witness
was able to identify the appellant in the police line-up inside the office of
the Chief of Police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While no motive
might have impelled the said witness in framing up the appellant, nevertheless,
this circumstance is no guaranty that she could not have made an honest
mistake.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span>
entertain serious doubt as to the sufficiency of the proof of appellant's identity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such doubt must be resolved in favor of the
appellant, it being preferable to acquit a guilty person rather than convict an
innocent one.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The only other evidence which directly implicates the appellant
to the crime at bar is his alleged extra-judicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with
the trial court in rejecting the appellant's claim of maltreatment, however, We
believe after mature reflection that the statements contained therein were not
his voluntary statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
extra-judicial confession contains statements of facts which were admittedly
untrue, that <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot believe it to be the voluntary
confession of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it
appears from the statements in the alleged confession that the appellant
together with <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Robles, <span class="SpellE">Dionesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alabe</span>, and two others whose names are unknown, robbed
the house of <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Manigos</span>
at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening of August 29, 1966 at <span class="SpellE">Blocon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>; that at about 12:00 o'clock midnight of the same
date, he and his companions wanted to rob the house of <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
Madrid at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> of the same municipality
but were unable to do so because they were noticed by the occupants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, according to the said confession, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Robles was their leader and that they were armed
with three (3) .38 caliber revolvers and two (2) .45 caliber pistols, which
were taken by <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Robles and <span class="SpellE">Dionesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alabe</span> after the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts, however, were not corroborated
by the evidence of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
found by the trial court and as testified to by the prosecution's only
eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutang</span>,
there were only three (3) persons who committed the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the case against <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Robles and <span class="SpellE">Dionesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabe</span>
were dismissed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> upon motion of the prosecution
for insufficiency of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the alleged weapons used in the robbery which were allegedly in the possession
of <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Robles and <span class="SpellE">Dionesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alabe</span> were neither recovered by the police nor presented
in evidence by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the prosecution has not presented any evidence that <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Robles and <span class="SpellE">Dionesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabe</span> <span class="GramE">were</span> with the appellant in
the attempt to rob the house of <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, only the appellant was
prosecuted for and convicted of trespass to dwelling (and not for robbery)
committed against <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This only confirms the appellant's assertions
that some of the answers to the questions propounded to him were not his
answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the statements
contained in the alleged confession were not his voluntary statements but the
words of the investigators put in the mouth of the appellant in accordance with
their preconceived theory as to the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, considering that the appellant is an unschooled
farmer, having reached Grave V only<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
and cannot understand and read English, his confession which is in English had
to be asked in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>, and had to be translated to
and typed in English and similarly his alleged answers in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
had to be translated to and typed in English.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a multiple process of reading and translating the questions and
translating and typing the answers and reading and translating again the
answers is naturally pregnant with possibilities of human, if not unintentional,
inadequacies and incompleteness which render the said confession unsafe as
basis for conviction for a capital offense, unless sufficiently corroborated.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

this Court had occasion to state that:</p>

<blockquote>"Although alibi is known to be the weakest of all defenses for
it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove, nevertheless, where the
evidence for the prosecution is weak and betrays lack of concreteness on the
question of whether or not the accused committed the crime charged, the defense
of alibi assumes importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in
the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>, et al., this Court held
that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> an accused cannot be convicted on
the basis of evidence which, independently of his alibi, is weak and uncorroborated,
and inconclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that alibi
must be satisfactorily proven was never intended to change the burden of proof
in criminal cases; otherwise, we will see the absurdity of an accused being put
in a more difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak
than where it is wrong.'</p>

<blockquote>"In other words, the prosecution has
the burden of proof in establishing the guilt of the accused beyond a
reasonable doubt and the weakness of the defense does not relieve it of this
responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused does not
have to prove his innocence because that is presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the prosecution's
evidence falls short of the <u>quantum</u> of evidence which will justify
conviction of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His guilt
has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and, therefore, he is entitled to
an acquittal."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

On pages 4-5 of the <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief, the Soli¬≠citor
General argues that the said witness "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> could not but recognized appellant when he and two companions
entered her house as she had a lighted bottle lamp nearby which was enough to
illuminate the place (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Id.) It was he
whom Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manigos</span> first saw to be the man outside
looking from the window through which he gained entrance to the house (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
also he who fired at her husband, <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span>, in her
pre¬≠sence and then aimed the pistol at her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was also present when appellant ordered her husband to lie on his
belly while his companions tied <span class="SpellE">Exe¬≠quiel's</span> (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manigos</span> saw how appellant tied her husband's feet with a
black sheet witness of cloth (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manigos</span>
had ample opportunity to see and remember the face of the appellant, so that it
was no wonder at all that she identified him in a line-up without
hesitation."</p>
