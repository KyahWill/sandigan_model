				<H3>NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, PETITIONER VS. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION AND JUAN TIVAR, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Petitioner National Development Company took this appeal by certiorari from 
the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in W. C. Case No. 789 
ordering it to pay Juan Tivar as compensation for total disability under Act No. 
3428, as amended, the sum of P3,744.00, and further sums of P800.00 and P280.00 
representing medical expenses incurred by the latter and attorney's fees 
respectively, and from its resolution en bane denying petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration. </p>
<p>Juan Tivar was employed by petitioner as carpenter on April 5, 1948 with a 
daily wage of P5.00. Due to a failing health, he was laid off on March 31, 1950 
and received from petitioner a so called gratuity in the amount of P250.00 
including the money value of his accrued leave. </p>
<p>On August 14 of the same year, Tivar was re-employed as carpenter after 
having been x-rayed at the instance of petitioner and found to be physically fit 
for work. </p>
<p>Sometime in November or December, 1952, while Tivar and a fellow worker were 
setting up a large wooden post in connection with the construction of an annex 
of the company's carpentry shop, the former slipped and the foot of the post 
which he was carrying upon his shoulder clipped him on the back, causing him to 
fed dizzy and fall on his knees. Fifteen days later he spat blood, but this 
notwithstanding, he continued to work until March 31, 1953 when he was laid-off 
after an X-ray examination had revealed that he was suffering from a "lung 
lesion (P.T.B.), bilateral, active and in its moderately advanced stage." </p>
<p>One month thereafter, he made a verbal demand for compensation but petitioner 
refused to pay alleging that he had already received compensation in 1950. On 
January 31, 1957, he filed a formal claim with the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission, which was duly controverted by petitioner. For unexplained reasons, 
however, the claim was not adjudicated. In view of this, on February 15, 1960, 
Tivar filed another formal claim for compensation with the Regional Office No. 3 
of the Department of Labor, Manila (VV. C. Case No. 789). Petitioner moved to 
dismiss it on the ground that the claim was already barred pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 24 of Act No. 3428, as amended. The hearing officer having 
denied the motion, on March 15, 1960, petitioner filed its answer controverting 
the material allegations of the claim. </p>
<p>After due trial, the hearing officer awarded compensation to Tivar in the sum 
of P3,744.00. On appeal, the Workmen's Compensation Commission rendered the 
decision appealed from affirming the award and granting Tivar reimbursement for 
medical expenses. </p>
<p>Petitioner's claim that Tivar's right has already pre- scribed is untenable. 
The facts stated heretofore clearly show that the provisions of Section 24, Act 
3428 have been substantially complied with. The oral demand for compensation 
made by Tivar sometime in April 1953 hardly a month after he was laid off 
constitutes such substantial compliance. It is, therefore, of little consequence 
in connection with petitioner's defense of prescription that the written claims 
for compensation were filed much later, the first on January 31, 1967 (the one 
that was never adjudicated by the Commission), and the second on February 15, 
1960. </p>
<p>Moreover, considering that the reason for his being laid off for the first 
time on March 31, 1950 was virtually the same for his being laid off on March 
31, 1953, it would not be unreasonable to consider the so-called gratuity in the 
amount of P250.O0 paid to Tivar, in the light of the pro- visions of the law 
invoked by petitioner itself, providing for cases where it is unnecessary for 
the employee to file a formal claim for compensation within the prescribed 
period. </p>
<p>The second contention of petitioner, namely, that Tivar is not entitled to 
compensation for <i>total disability</i> is likewise without merit. The hearing 
officer and the Workmen's Compensation Commission found as a fact that Tivar was 
totally disabled for the kind of work that he did for petitioner for many years. 
Such finding is binding upon petitioner. That subsequent to his being laid off, 
Tivar was still able to undertake "contracting carpentry jobs" does not argue at 
all against the finding aforesaid, such work being entirely different from doing 
actual carpentry work. </p>
<p>The hearing officer disallowed Tivarâ€™s claim for medical expenses on the 
ground of insufficiency of evidence to justify an award in his favor. This 
finding was expressly reversed on appeal, the Commission holding that such an 
error could "not be allowed to pass uncorrected if we were to render or 
promulgate a fair judgment in this case," This means that the Commission found 
as a fact that Tivar was justified in submitting- himself to treatment by 
private practitioners. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is affirmed, with costs. </p>
