				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original action for <i>mandamus</i> to compel the City
Mayor of Manila to file administrative charges with the Municipal Board against
certain members of the Manila Police Department in accordance with Section 1 of
Republic Act No. 557.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts are not
disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 7, 1959 the Court of
First Instance of Manila (then presided </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Hon. <span class="SpellE">Carmelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>) rendered its
decision in the case of People of the Philippines v. <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span>
Cruz, <u>alias</u> Captain Tommy, et al. (Criminal Case No. 32916), finding the
accused guilty of murder for the fatal shoot­ing of one Manuel Valencia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said decision the trial court made the
observation that Captain Jose <span class="SpellE">Rarang</span> and then Lt.
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, both of the Manila Police Depart­ment,
had exerted pressure, "from persuasion to downright intimidation," on
Sgt. Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, a prosecution wit­ness, to make
him reform his statement in order to </span><span style="">create </span><span style="">a doubt </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to the identity of
the accused Captain Tommy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
also observed that <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Lt. </span><span style="">Jesus Buenaventura,
another </span><span style="">member of the Manila
Police Department, did not hesitate to perjure his testimony for the purpose of
discrediting prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> Cruz in an
effort to clear Captain Tommy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
foregoing observations were </span><span style="">confirmed by this Cou</span><span style="">r</span><span style="">t in the decision</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> affirming that of
the trial </span><span style="">court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is ample evidence in the record of persistent attempts
- by officers of the police department of Manila, acting on behalf or for the
benefit of appellant <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> Cruz - to suppress, or
tamper with, important evidence for the prosecution, or to influence - even to
intimidate - some of its main witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, these attempts, condemnable as they are, in general,
become more reprehensible coming as they did from members of the very agency
charged special­ly with the duty to maintain peace and <span style="">order and to assist in the administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if made in the earnest belief that said
defendant is innocent of the crime charged, they tend to impair the faith of
the people in the </span><span style="">law </span><span style="">enforcing </span>organs of the
government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 30, 1965 the petitioner wrote a letter <span style="">to the respondent calling the latter's
attention to the conduct of Capt. <span class="SpellE">Rarang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> and Buenaventura, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">described in the aforesaid decision, and
requesting him to take appropriate administrative action against the police
officers involved, in accordance with the </span><span style="">provisions </span><span style="">of Republic Act No. 557.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
refusing to comply with the request, the respondent informed the petitioner
that </span><span style="">in
</span><span style="">accordance with the
recommendation of his Legal Assistant, who had conducted a fact-finding
inquiry, his Office had absolved said police officers of any administrative
responsibility, so the matter should be considered closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon the petitioner instituted the
instant action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After this case was
submitted for decision the President of the Philippines signed into law
Republic Act No. 4864, otherwise known as the "Police Act of 1966,"
providing for a new procedure in the matter of preferring and investigation of
charges against police officers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sections 14 and 15 of said law read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 14.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Removal and Suspension </u><u><span style="">of Members of the Police Force or Agency</span></u><span style="">.? </span>Members of the local police
agency shall not be suspended or removed except upon written complaint filed
under oath with the Board of Investigators herein provided for misconduct or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span>, dishonesty, disloyalty to the Government,
serious irregularities in the performance of their duties, and violation of
law.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 15.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Board of Investigators</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>-
In every local police agency there shall be a Board of Investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charges <span style="">against
</span>any member of the city and/or municipal police agency shall be investi­gated
by a Board of Investigators of three members, composed of the city or municipal
treasurer as chairman, a representative of the Provincial Commander, and <span style="">a </span>councilor,
elected by a majority of the city or muni­cipal council concerned, as members.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Copy of the charges shall be furnished the respondent by the
Chairman of the Board of Investigators within five days <span style="">from the </span>date of filing of said charges and the res­pondent
shall answer within five days from receipt thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Investigators <span style="">shall conduct its
investigation in public within five days </span><span style="">from receipt of respon­</span>dent's answer to the charges or from the
expiration of respondent's period to answer, whichever is earlier and unless
for good cause <span style="">shown </span>the
investigation shall be finished within thirty days thereafter and the Board
shall submit the records of the investigation, its findings and recommendations
to the Police Commission within thirty days after the termination of the
investiga­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the
Police Com­mission shall be final and must be rendered <span style="">within </span>seventy-five days from the time of receipt of the findings
of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disciplinary jurisdiction
of offenses involving suspension of not more than ten days or forfeiture of not
more than fifteen days' pay is vested in the chief of the police agency
concerned whose decision shall be final.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Board of Investigators shall also conduct investigations and
decide claims relative to benefits as provided under this Act, subject to
appeal to the Police Commission whose decision shall be final."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the Police Manual embodied in Executive Order No. 113, issued
on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="12">December 30, 1967</st1:date> to
implement Republic Act No. 4864, the following appears:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">"Section
7.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>R</u><u><span style="">ules of Procedure</span></u><span style="">.</span></span></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The following rules of procedure shall be
adopted by the Board of Investigators <span style="">in
the administration of all administrative cases brought before it:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>How commenced</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- All proceeding must be commenced by a complaint
in writing and under oath in the name of the aggrieved party or his duly
authorized representative or guardian against any member of a city or municipal
police agency who appears to be responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that the provision of Section 1 of Republic Act
No. 557, to the effect that charges in cases against a member of the city
police shall be preferred <span style="">by the city
mayor, has been eliminated in Republic Act No. 4864.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this new law it would seem that any
interested party may file the complaint, although the Police Manual requires
that the same be done in the name of the aggrieved party or his duly authorized
representative or guardian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
this charge, it is clear that the question of whether or not the respondent, as
City Mayor, may be com­pelled by <i>mandamus</i> to prefer the charges, as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">duty speci­fically
enjoined upon him by Republic Act No. 557, has be­come moot and academic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">Wherefore</b><span style="">, the petition is dismissed, without costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
