				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Teodora O. Juliano is the owner of a parcel of rice land located in Calamba, 
Laguna, while Patricio Magtibay is her tenant therein under a verbal tenancy 
contract that began since 1957. On May 5, 1960, Magtibay wrote his landowner 
informing her that he was electing to convert their share tenancy into a 
leasehold tenancy and fixing the amount of rental he would pay for each 
agricultural year adding that his election was predicated on Section 14 of 
Republic Act No. 1199, as amended, which provides, among other things, that "The 
tenant shall have the right to change the tenancy contract from one of share 
tenancy to leasehold tenancy."
<p>On May 16, 1960, the landowner, thru her lawyer, wrote Magtibay informing him 
that she regreted being unable to give her conformity to the conversion of their 
share tenancy relationship into one of leasehold until the courts shall have 
finally determined the validity of the portion of the law invoked by Magtibay in 
an appropriate proceeding which the landowner would shortly institute. 
Accordingly, on May 25, 1960, the landowner filed with the Court of First 
Instance of Laguna a petition, docketed as Civil Case No. B-252, for declaratory 
relief against Magtibay praying that that portion of Section 14 of the Tenancy 
Act which gives Magtibay the right to change his status from share tenant to 
that of lessee be declared unconstitutional and void.</p>
<p>In spite of the petition for declaratory relief filed by the landowner before 
the Court of First Instance of Laguna, Magtibay, the tenant, in turn filed with 
the Court of Agrarian Relations on June 6, 1960 a petition stating that he is a 
share tenant on a land about 1 1/2 hectares owned by Teodora O. Juliano to whom 
he served a written notice on May 5, 1960 of his intention to change their 
tenancy relationship to leasehold tenancy but that she answered, thru her 
lawyer, saying that she could not grant his desire for the reasons she stated 
therein, and so he asked that his landlord be compelled to agree to a leasehold 
tenancy and fix the number of cavans of palay he would have to pay as rental for 
the land. The petition was docketed as CAR Case No. 383.</p>
<p>On June 30, 1960, Magtibay filed in the case for declaratory relief (Civil 
Case No. B-252) a motion to dismiss contending, among others, that the court has 
no jurisdiction over the case because the same was instituted after the landlord 
had committed a breach or an actionable violation of the very provision of law 
whose construction or invalidation she was seeking by obstructing the lawful 
exercise by her tenant of a right given to him under it, aside from the fact 
that the issue of constitutionality of the assailed provision of law is but an 
incident to the controversy then pending between the same tenant and landlord 
before the Court of Agrarian Relations which case comes under the original and 
exclusive jurisdiction of the latter under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199 
and Section 7 of Republic Act 1267.</p>
<p>After considering the motion to dismiss, the opposition thereto by the 
landlord, and the memoranda submitted by both parties, the Court of First 
Instance of Laguna denied the motion in an order issued on September 14, 1960. 
His motion for reconsideration having been denied, Magtibay filed a petition for 
certiorari with this Court contending that respondent judge committed a grave 
abuse of discretion or acted in excess of his jurisdiction in denying his motion 
to dismiss and so he prayed that the order of denial be set aside and that in 
the meantime a writ of preliminary injunction be issued to restrain said judge 
from proceeding with the petition for relief. This petition was docketed as G. 
R. No. L-17590.</p>
<p>In view of the pendency of the petition for declaratory relief in which the 
landowner raised the constitutionality of the pertinent portion of Section 14 of 
the Tenancy Act, which was invoked by the tenant in asking for the conversion of 
the share tenancy relationship to leasehold tenancy, the landowner, in her 
answer filed in the tenancy case then pending before the Court of Agrarian 
Relations (CAR Case No. 383), asked that the trial of said case be suspended 
until the validity of the challenged provision of the Tenancy Act is finally 
determined. And since notwithstanding this move the court apparently was bent on 
trying the case on the merits as shown by the fact that it set the case for 
hearing on August 5, 1960, the landowner filed on July 29, 1960 a petition 
squarely asking that the trial of the tenancy case be suspended in view of the 
pendency of the case for declaratory judgment before the Court of First Instance 
of Laguna.</p>
<p>After the hearing held on this petition wherein the landowner invoked the 
impropriety for the agrarian court to pass on the constitutionality of the 
provision of law in question after the Court of First Instance of Laguna had 
assumed jurisdiction over the petition for declaratory judgment, and after said 
court had denied the motion to dismiss filed therein, the agrarian court denied 
the motion to suspend trial filed by the landowner, setting the case again for 
trial on the merits. And when her second motion for suspension of trial was 
denied, the landowner filed with this court a petition for certiorari, also with 
preliminary injunction, imputing grave abuse of discretion to the agrarian court 
for having denied her motion to suspend trial in view of the pendency of the 
case for declaratory relief before the Court of First Instance of Laguna. This 
petition was docketed as G. R. No. L-17627.</p>
<p>Both petitions for certiorari, involving as they do the same parties and 
similar issues, are now the subject of this joint decision. In the meantime, 
this Court issued Writs of preliminary injunction prayed for to maintain the 
<i>status quo</i> of the two cases from which the two petitions originated.</p>
<p>One thing that should be emphasized is that, as early as May 5, I960, the 
share tenant Patricio Magtibay informed his landowner Teodora O. Juliano of his 
decision to change the nature of their tenancy relationship from share tenancy 
to leasehold tenancy pursuant to the right granted to a tenant by Section 14 of 
Republic Act No. 1199, known as the Agricultural Tenancy Act. Instead of 
expressing her conformity to such desire, the landlord informed her tenant that 
she regretted her inability to give her approval to the conversion for she was 
then contemplating to raise the validity of the portion of the provision of law 
invoked by him in an appropriate proceeding which she was planning to institute 
shortly. Because of such refusal to agree to his desire as authorized by law, 
the tenant's counsel adopted the position that the landowner had committed a 
breach or an actionable violation of the very provision of law whose 
construction or invalidation she was precisely seeking by obstructing the lawful 
exercise by tenant Magtibay of the right given to him under it; and, therefore, 
the court of first instance can no longer assume jurisdiction over the case 
pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 66 of the Rules of Court which provides that "A 
contract or statute may be construed <i>before</i> there has been a breach 
thereof."</p>
<p>We agree to the position taken by counsel regarding the attitude adopted by 
the landlord concerning the request of the tenant to convert his tenancy 
relationship from share tenancy into leasehold tenancy, for, judging from the 
context of Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act, it is clear that the 
tenant is given the <i>right</i> to change his tenancy contract from one of 
share to leasehold tenancy upon his decision. The landlord, it is true, may 
dispute such right if he so desires, but then he would run the risk of violating 
a specific provision of the law. In such eventuality, his remedy is not to file 
a petition for declaratory judgment, but wait until the case is brought before 
the Court of Agrarian Relations where he may resist the plea by invoking the 
invalidity of the law. And if his claim is ignored or overruled, he may bring 
the matter to the Supreme Court for final determination. We are, therefore, of 
the opinion that the Court of First Instance of Laguna acted improvidently, if 
not with grave abuse of discretion, in denying the motion to dismiss filed by 
the tenant in the case of declaratory judgment.</p>
<p>Since the tenant, consistent with his request for conversion, has filed a 
petition with the agrarian court seeking to compel his landlord to agree to his 
decision to convert his share tenancy into a leasehold tenancy, our opinion is 
that that court can pass upon the validity of the portion of the law disputed by 
the landowner as an incident of its jurisdiction over the tenancy case. In the 
event that the agrarian court should uphold the validity of the disputed 
provision upon the theory that a law is presumed to be constitutional, then the 
matter may be brought by the landowner to this Court for final determination. In 
this respect we find correct the following comment made by the Court of Agrarian 
Relations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Contrary to the contention of respondent, if Sec. 14 were to be declared 
constitutional in the declaratory relief proceedings before the Court of First 
Instance, the instant petition would have to be heard just the same to resolve 
certain questions of fact over which the Agrarian Court has exclusive 
jurisdiction. Those questions are: the date of effectivity of the change from 
sharehold to leasehold tenancy, depending on whether there is a written 
registered tenancy contract or whether the tenancy agreement is merely verbal; 
the amount of rental to be paid by the petitioner to the respondent, depending 
on whether the land is first or second class land and also on the amount of the 
production of the past three normal harvests after deducting the amount used as 
seedlings as well as the harvesting and threshing expenses. Incidentally, the 
latter question is quite involved and we have seen in many cases that the 
parties have disputed heatedly the question of rentals.</p>
<p>"As we see it, the only end which could be accomplished in the declaratory 
relief proceedings before the Court of First Instance is to test, in the first 
instance, the constitutionality of Sec. 14 and thereby pave the elevation of 
that constitutional question to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>"This end, we believe, is not sufficient to justify noncompliance with the 
duty of this Court to decide or settle tenancy cases with dispatch.</p>
<p>"We arrived at the above conclusion not, as respondent fears, due to want of 
a 'sense of becoming modesty' or want of 'courtesy' to the Court of First 
Instance but due to the fact that should we proceed to hear the petition as now 
filed with this Court, the respondent will have the same opportunity of 
elevating that question of constitutionality to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>"At any rate, the only serious objection which respondent could raise against 
the procedure of hearing the petition now filed with this Court pending final 
determination of the constitutionality of Sec. 14 is that this Court would have 
to declare or presume the said provision to be constitutional; that Sec. 14 
would thus be enforced before final determination of its constitutionality. But 
if it should turn out to be so, the execution of the decision to be rendered by 
this Court could be stayed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the petition in G. R. No. L-17590 is granted. The Court hereby 
sets aside the orders issued by respondent judge on August 8, 1960 and October 
5, 1960. The writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court on October 18, 
1960 is declared permanent.</p>
<p>The petition in G. R. No. L-17627 is denied. The writ of preliminary 
injunction issued by this Court on October 31, 1960 is hereby dissolved.</p>
<p>No special pronouncement as to costs in both cases.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J, B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
