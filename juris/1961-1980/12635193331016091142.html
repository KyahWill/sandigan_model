order of Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Emi­liano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span> and the <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution on the
motion for reconsideration of the said order, is­sued by the respondent Court

therein relative to the reinstatement of and payment of back wages to
respondent Soledad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, as or­dained in the
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment rendered by it against
petitioners in its Case No. 1796-ULP, dated February 10, 1960, which was
affirmed on appeal by this Court on April 30, 1966 in G. R. No. L-17037.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Soledad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was, from <st1:date year="1951" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1951</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1958" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1958</st1:date>, continuously
employed by the petitioner East Asiatic Co. Ltd., a corporation licensed to
engage in the import, export and shipping business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been dismissed on September 1, 1958
from the service of the said company, through its managers E. <span class="SpellE">Jakobsen</span> and K. R. Nielsen and its assistant-manager P. H.
Sorensen, respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed with the respondent
Court of Industrial Relations the aforemen­tioned Case No. 1796-ULP - a charge
of unfair labor practice against said petitioner company and its above-named
officials; and the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, after appropriate proceed­ings,
rendered judgment against petitioners (respondents below) with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court, finding the respondents guilty of the
un­fair labor practices complained of, hereby orders them to cease and desist
from further committing the same and to reinstate Soledad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> immediately to her former position with back wages
from September 1, 1958 until actually reinstat­ed, with all the rights and
privi­leges acquired and due her, includ­ing seniority and such other terms and
conditions of employment existing at the time of her lay-off."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This decision was affirmed by Us in G. R. No. L-­17037, <u>supra</u>,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1966</st1:date> in the
following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, her reinstatement with back pay was correctly
ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment affirmed, with
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears further that before this Court could return the
records of the case to the lower court for execution, the petitioner company
filed a manifesta­tion dated June 14, 1966, making known its willingness to
reinstate respondent Soledad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to her former
position with the same salary she was receiving at the time of her dismissal
from its service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that mani­festation
respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed a counter-manifestation
wherein she averred that she was willing to be re­instated to her former
position, but her monthly salary should be the amount she was receiving on the
date of her dismissal plus the yearly general wage increases petitioners have
given to their employees from 1958 to 1965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners made a reply to the said counter-manifestation, reiterating
their previous offer to re­instate respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
to her former position as stated in their previous manifestation, and pointing
out that by the terms of the decision ordering her re­instatement the same is
to be made on the basis of what said respondent was receiving at the time of
her lay­off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting thereon, on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1966</st1:date>, this Court is­sued a
resolution worded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In G. R. No. L-17037 (The East Asiatic Co., Ltd., et al. vs.
Court of Industrial Relations, et al.) the Court resolved:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' reply to respondents'
counter-manifestation of June 16, 1966 is here­by noted, with the observation
that the matter treated of therein, as well as in the previous manifesta­tions
of the parties, may be taken up on the lower court in connection with the
implementation of its deci­sion, which has been affirmed by this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, a motion to compute the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
due her under the decision in her favor appears to have been filed by respondent
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> on June 8, 1966, which motion became the
subject of an opposition submitted by the petitioners before the Court of
Industrial Rela­tions, and whereupon, the trial court issued the fol­lowing
order:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting on the motion to com­pute filed by the complainants,
through counsel, alleging among others that the decision of this Court in the
above-entitled case dated February 10, 1960, affirmed by the Supreme Court in a
final entry of judgment dated April 30, 1966, is now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and, therefore, the computation of her <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> is now in order and finding the motion
well-taken.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, as prayed for, the Chief of the Examining Divi­sion
of this Court or his autho­rized representative, is hereby directed to proceed
to the offices of the respondent East Asiatic Co., Ltd. at <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
&amp; Shanghai Build­ing, Juan Luna, Manila, which is requested to make its
record per­tinent in this case available to said Examiner - and verify and
compute from such records the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of the
individual complain­ant in accordance with the final decision of this Court
dated Feb­ruary 10, 1960 and immediately upon termination to submit a re­port
thereof for further disposi­tion of this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the order above-quoted, the Chief Exa­miner of the
examining division of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> made the required
computation and, thereafter, submitted the corresponding report thereon, dated
March 2, 1967, in­forming the trial court that the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to which re­spondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> should be entitled for the
period from September 28, 1958 (date of her dismissal) to February 28, 1967
(apparently, this was the date the examination was concluded, up to which,
respondent was still not re­instated) would amount to P30,090.00, while her
earn­ings from other employers during the same period that she was separated
from the service of petitioners amount to P42,881.44 (P6,691.44 - earned in the
Philippines; and, P36,190.00 - the peso value of respondent's alleged <u>dollar</u>
earnings in the United States, computed at the exchange rate of P3.90 to $1.00)
And on the basis of these figures, the said examiner concluded in his report
that "If the total amount of P42,881.44 representing the earnings
elsewhere of Mrs. Soledad <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> were allowed by the
Honorable Court as proper deductions from her comput­ed total <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of P30,090.00, she will no longer re­ceive any
back wages." After a hearing was had on the said report, and after
considering the various pleadings commenting thereon (Annexes P, Q, R and S,
Petition) filed by the parties, Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span> of the respondent Court issued an order, dated May
12, 1967, approving the P30,090.00 - <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
computed by the examiner, but disallowing the P42,881.44 alleged out­side
earnings of respondent Soledad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> mentioned in
his report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor reasoned thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The matter now before this Court is whether to approve or disapprove
the report of the Examiner dated March 2, 1967, especially that portion thereof
which computed alleged outside earnings of complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
using as basis thereof alleged affi­davits of persons living in the United
States of America, copies of which are attached to the various manifesta­tions
filed by the respondents in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On this question and from the re­cords of this case, the
Court finds that the report of the Examiner in so far as it computed the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in
the amount of P30,090.00 is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the point, however, of whether or not to deduct the amount of P42,881.44 from
the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
the Court is of the considered opinion that the same may not be deducted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
so because respond­ents failed to adduce any evidence in support of their claim
that complain­ant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> earned that much from other
employers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Examining Division of
this Court, in arriving at such figure, made use of alleged affidavits of
persons in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
copies of which are attached to the manifest­ation filed by respondent in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Examiner of the Court in so
doing, exceed his authority, as stated in the Court order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Examiner was not directed to com­pute
any other wages against said claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, when the respondents were given the opportunity to present
competent evidence in support of their allegation that complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> earned that amount during the time of her dismissal,
they failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged
affidavits attached to the various manifesta­tions filed with this Court were
not even identified by witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
that such alleged affidavits are merely pieces of paper and do not have any
value as evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In passing the Court
also is of the considered opinion that claims for wages earned outside the
jurisdic­tion of this country and necessarily this Court, are not those wages
that may properly be considered to offset any computed claims for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law
envisions that these claims should be within the jurisdiction of this Court and
not otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claims of respondents
for <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> earnings elsewhere find no merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Court finds that the computed <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of Sole-dad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in
the amount of P30,090.00 is hereby approved; and respond­ents are ordered to
pay said sum to complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fur­ther,
the alleged outside earnings of complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> are
hereby de­nied for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Exami­ning Division of this Court is fur­ther directed to compute the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
from <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1967</st1:date> up to the
date she is actually reinstated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the fact, however, that complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> did not pre­sent any evidence in support of her claim
that she is entitled to fringe benefits, etc., cited in her motion to compute
dated <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1966</st1:date>, the same
is hereby denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of this order with
the Court of Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> which resolved the said
motion with a divided vote of three to two.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a resolution dated June 27, 1967, Asso­ciate Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, with the
concurrence of Presiding Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> I. Martinez,
voted to deny the motion; while Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>, in a separate concurring and dissenting
opinion which was concurred in (in the result) by Associate Judges <span class="SpellE">Ans­berto</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and Joaquin
M. Salvador, voted to mo­dify the order sought to be reconsidered in the sense
that respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was held to be no longer
entitled to reinstatement, nor to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the
time she left the Philippines for the United States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent portions of this majority opinion,
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In a 'Summary of Arguments' filed with this Court dated <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1967</st1:date>, it is submitted and
not denied that certain undisputable developments took place in that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> went to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a pleading filed with the Supreme Court while this case was on appeal
therein, a copy of which was furnished counsel for <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
then in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
she was formally asked to report for work the next day, <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She came back to the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
day, counsel for respondents met her at the office of her lawyers and there she
was told to report to re­spondents for work, which she never did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, she went to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Forthwith, the issue is whether Soledad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> is still entitled to reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and how much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her refusal to report for work and her continued stay in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it is believed, is a waiver of her
right to be reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
employer, or for that mat­ter any employer, could not be made to wait for her
to report at her pleasure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could not
dilly-dally with her presentation to management to work in order to make her <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> run until she chooses to report for work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the matter of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, re­gardless
of whether she worked in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or not and regardless of whether this Court has jurisdiction over her earnings
abroad, it is undisputable that while she was in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, she could not have worked in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sequently, although Soledad A. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> is entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
the same should commence from the time she was dismissed until she left the
country for the first time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
modification of the Order sought to be reconsidered because of the
above-mentioned developments that took place in the premises."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In brief, in the lower court's resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
while the trial judge, with the concurrence of the presiding judge, ruled that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> is entitled to full payment of her <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without any deduction of any kind, but at the
same time without any right to fringe benefits and general increases which the
peti­tioners might have given to their employees, from the date of her
dismissal to the date of her actual reinstatement, on the other hand, the three
other judges, constituting the majority, were in agreement that respondent's <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be limited only to the period from her dismissal
to the date she first left for the United States, regardless of whether or not
she se­cured gainful employment there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Premise of the minori­ty's conclusion is that no competent evidence was
pre­sented by petitioners to prove respondent's other al­leged employments
whether here or in the United States, while the majority considered the fact of
respondent's having left for America as undisputed and the proof of her
earnings there as irrelevant and immaterial, for "while she was in the
United States, she could not have worked in the Philippines."</p>

<p class="BODY">After a review of the record, the Court holds that neither of
these two views is entirely correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">The specific basis of the minority in ruling against petitioners'
claim for deduction of alleged earnings elsewhere of respondent after her
lay-off is that the affidavits submitted by them were nothing but mere copies
of originals, the existence of which has not been shown, and, in any event, the
said affidavits and even the testimony of the lone witness, a certain G.
Francisco, from Standard Vacuum Oil Company, are either hearsay or inconclusive
or vague.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that such ruling
is <span class="SpellE">overtechnical</span> and does not conform with the
provisions of the law, much less the spirit inform­ing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only does Section 20 of Commonwealth Act
103 creating the Court of Industrial Relations precisely endow the said court
with such plenitude of authority "(T)hat in the hearing, investigation and
determination of any question or controversy and in exercising any du­ties and
power under this Act, the Court shall act accord­ing to justice and equity and
substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms
and shall not be bound by any technical rules of legal evi­dence but may inform
its mind in such manner as it may deem just and equitable", but Section
5(b) of the Indus­trial Peace Act pointedly provides that in unfair labor
proceedings,</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be
controlling and it is the spirit and intention of this Act that the Court and
its members and Hearing Examiners shall use every and all reasonable means to
ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively and with­out regard
to technicalities of law or procedure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In rendering its de­cision, the Court shall not be bound solely by the
evidence pre­sented during the hearing but may avail itself of all other means
such as (but not limited to) ocular inspections and questioning of well?informed
persons which results must be made a part of the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the proceeding before the Court or a
Hearing Examiner thereof, the parties shall not be required to be represented
by legal counsel and it shall be the duty and obligation of the Court or Hearing
Examiner to examine and cross-examine witnesses on behalf of the parties and to
as­sist in the orderly presentation of evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The determination of how much should be paid as <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> when payment thereof is ordered in an unfair
labor practice case constitutes either an inevitable sequel or a part and
parcel of the whole proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conse­quently,
there is no reason why the same simple, liberal and non-technical procedure
indicated in Section 5(b) just quoted should not be observed in such
determination, particularly if it is considered that under Section 5 (c), the
discretion granted to the court in the imposi­tion of the appropriate sanction
against any party guilty of unfair labor practices is so broad that it is not
confined merely to the issuance of an "order requir­ing such person to cease
and desist from such unfair la­bor practice" but includes also the
authority to "take such affirmative action as will effectuate the policies
of (the) Act, including (but not limited to) reinstate­ment of employees with
or without <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> and including rights of the
employees prior to dismissal including se­niority.", and having in view,
further, the limited time of thirty (30) days within which the matters
"relative to such disputes" is <span class="SpellE">mandatorily</span>
required to be decided by the Court, (Section 5 [d],which considerations unmis­takably
indicate the policy of the law to make all un­fair labor practice proceedings
and the incidents there­of as simple, speedy and expeditious as possible, to
the end that they may be undertaken without regard to proce­dural technicalities
save as may be indispensable for due process and decided strictly according to
the sub­stantial merits of the respective claims of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> vs. CIR, G. R. No. 46496, February 27,1940, 69 Phil.

G. R. No. L-19791, <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1968</st1:date>,
24 SCRA, 591.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, much of the delay in the disposition of this case could
have been avoided had the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>
adopted a more practical and less technical approach to the problem before it,
as envisioned by the law. In principle, respondent's right to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> was not being seriously denied by
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question raised by
them was as to the amount thereof; in other words, how much, on the one hand,
should be added to the basic pay by way of restoration of "all rights and
pri­vileges acquired and due her, including seniority and such other terms and
conditions of employment existing at the time of her lay-off" as ordained
in the judgment and as contemplated in the above-quoted provisions of the law
and, on the other, how much should be deducted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
by way of earnings elsewhere pursuant to the guidelines set down in <span class="SpellE">Itogon-Suyoc</span>, <u>infra</u>, and the long/line of decisions,
to be more appropriately cited later, on the same point.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with such position of petitioners, it appears that
they had manifested to the court below their willingness to immediately
reinstate respondent "in her former position with the salary she was receiving
at the date of her separation from its service." Of course, such
manifestation was hardly of any legal significance, since the judgment to be
implemented was already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and could
not be subjected to conditions inconsistent therewith, and neither was the
subsequent counter-manifestation of respondent imposing her own conditions for
her return to work of any legal consequence, as she had no right to ask for
more than what the deci­sion granted her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The point is that in such a situation, it is implicit in the law that
what the court should have done as the initial step was to order immediate
implemen­tation of the ordered reinstatement, without prejudice to resolving
the question of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that manner, all of these questions vexing
the parties and the court could have been avoided or at least minimized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is the long lay-off that
creates problems not only for the employer, with regard to how much has to be
paid in <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, but also, and this is worse, for
the discharged employee or worker, as to whom naturally the damage is always
bound to be beyond complete repair since during the uncertain period of
lay-off, he and his family have to undergo the difficulties, hardships and
vicissitudes of unemployment until he can have some kind of earning
elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, with
immediate reinstatement upon the court's finding of just and legal ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> no injury is caused to either employer or
employee, for the former gets the benefit of the lat­ter's work and the latter
receives due compensation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obvious advantages of this arrangement in
terms of industrial peace and economic and social progress, and to the larger
interests of the nation as a whole, are in­calculable.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the exact amount of her <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
it is unquestionable that under the decision being executed, respondent, as
already stated, is entitled to "all the rights and privileges acquired and
due her, including seniority, and such other terms and conditions of employ­ment
existing at the time of her lay-off." In Philip­pine Air Lines, Inc. vs.
PALEA, et al., G. R. No. L-­21120, Feb. 28, 1967, involving an almost
identically worded judgment as in this case, We held such judgment to mean
"<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for the lay-off period, coupled with
the 'seniority or other rights and privileges' attached to the status of the
employees when they were dismissed, (or) (T)o put it differently, said
employees (should be treated) as if they had not been absent from work and had
been uninterruptedly working during the lay-off period." Having in view
the spirit of the law, the court should not have expected respondent to assume
the whole burden of proving the factual bases of the relief to which she is
entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From their very nature, such
matters are more or less within the peculiar knowledge of her employer, since
they are necessarily found in the books and records of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, it was incumbent upon both
parties to disclose to the court all the material facts, within their respective
particular knowledge instead of ex­pecting the other to follow the ordinary
procedure of pre­senting evidence to prove them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As may be noted in the procedure for unfair
labor practice proceedings outlined in Section 5(b), <u>supra</u>, in cases of
this nature, the court, unlike in ordinary cases, does not act merely as a
referee but is supposed to take active part in drawing out the true facts from
the parties concerned, exercising thus more of the administrative than the
judicial aspect of its au­thority. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Accordingly, in the face of seeming inadequacy
of respondent's evidence relative to the "rights and privi­leges"
which the basic decision recognized she is entitled to and/or the apparent, if
natural, hesitancy of petitioners to disclose facts connected therewith within
their pe­culiar knowledge, it was incumbent upon the court to take the needed
steps to compel the petitioners to cooperate with it by being candid and frank
about such facts and not to hide behind the usual cloak of the technicality
that it is respondent's exclusive responsibility to establish her claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law, such responsibility for the
discovery of the material facts is not of the worker or employ­ee alone, but of
the employer and, in a sense, of the court as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is the duty of the Examiner charged
by the court to compute <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, as in this case,
to look into the books and records of the employer and report to the court the
relevant facts appearing therein connected with the claim of the discharged
employee or worker and it is the correlative obligation of the employer to
allow such examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, turning to the deductions claimed by petition­ers, although
the basic decision in this case did not say so expressly, it is well settled
that an employer is enti­tled to deduct from what the court orders to be paid
as <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, privileges, etc., whatever an employee
has earn­ed elsewhere during the period for which <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
are supposed to be paid, hence such qualification must be con­sidered implied
in all judgments ordering reinstatement, unless otherwise expressly ordered for
reasons the court may deem justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a rather long line of decisions involving payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to employees who have been illegally dismissed in consequence of unfair labor
prac­tices on the part of their employers, We have uniformly held that whatever
the dismissed laborer had actually earned during the period of his illegal
dismissal should be deducted from his computed <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
for the same period,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
on the principle that no one should be allowed to enrich himself at the expense
of another.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
And in this connection, We stated in precise terms the guide­lines to be
observed in the ascertainment of total <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
payable in <span class="SpellE"><u>Itogon-Suyoc</u></span><u> Mines, Inc</u>., <u>supra</u>,<u>
</u>thus</p>

<blockquote>"Since the dismissal of re­spondents in 1958, more than ten
years had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not seem out
of place to restate the guidelines to be observed in the ascertainment of the
total <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> payable under the judgment
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be
deducted from the back wages accruing to each of the laborers to be reinstated
is the total amount of earnings obtained by him from other em­ployment(s) from
the date of dis­missal to the date of reinstate­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the laborer decide that it is
preferable not to return to work, the deduction should be made up to the time
judgment becomes final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And these, for
the reason that em­ployees should not be permit­ted to enrich themselves at the
expense of their employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Philippine
Air Lines, Inc. vs. Philippine Air Lines Employees Association, L-15544, July
26, 1960 <u>and cases cited therein</u>.) Besides, there is the 'law's
abhorrence for double compensation.' (Republic Savings Bank vs. Court of
Industrial Rela­tions, 1967D <span class="SpellE">Phild</span>. 198, 202
[Resolution]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, in miti­gation of the damages that the dismissed respondents
are enti­tled to, account should be ta­ken of whether in the exercise of due
diligence respondents might have obtained income from suitable remunerative em­ployment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Behn</span>, Meyer &amp; Co., H. <span class="SpellE">Mij</span>.,
57 Phil. 775, 778-779, <u>citing</u> Garcia Palomar vs. Hotel de France Co., 42

it is really unjust that a discharged employee should, with folded arms, remain
inactive in the ex­pectation that a windfall would come to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary view would breed idleness; it is
conducive to lack of initiative on the part of a laborer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both bear the stamp of undesirability."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, it must be emphasized that it is inconsistent with the
intent of the law to permit the parties to play hide-and-seek in connection
with the determination of the bases and the amounts of the deductions to be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner that the employer must
disclose the material facts within his peculiar knowledge affecting the rights
and privileges of the discharged employee or work­er during the period of
lay-off so that the corresponding amounts to be added to the basic <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> may be speed­ily and justly determined, so also,
it is the correspond­ing duty of the employee or worker to be honest and fully
comprehensive in informing the court, with the least pos­sible delay, the
circumstances of any gainful employment or work he or she has had during the
lay-off period, par­ticularly the true income derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
thereby to enable the court to make the corresponding deductions to which the
employer is entitled pursuant to the jurispru­dence <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this duty of the employee or worker
to assist the court by frank and candid disclosure of his earnings elsewhere
during the period of lay-off is but a corollary of his obligation to minimize
his own da­mages consequent to the action, if unwarranted and illegal, of the
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no sense in
construing the law in such a way as to permit or oblige the parties to engage
in protracted and complicated proceedings which can only result in probable
flaring up of emotions and the multiplication of reasons for discord, and more
im­portantly, the waste of man hours otherwise needed in the productive
enterprise or industry to which the employer is dedicated, when, after all,
what is sought cannot be anything more than what is fair and equitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, both views in the court below must be rectified and
the decision appealed from accordingly mo­dified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the ruling of the majority in
the court below to the effect that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
is entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> only from the time of her dismissal
to the date she left for the United States on July 15, 1964 is not good law, in
the sense that it fails to con­sider that in this particular case it is
undisputed that respondent's departure for the United States was to look for
employment, fulfillment precisely of her obligation to minimize her damages
resulting from her unjusti­fied dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As long as the reinstatement of an ille­gally dismissed worker or
employee has not been carried out he can seek employment or work anywhere,
including in a foreign country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely,
his departure from the Philippines for such purpose should not constitute a
waiver of his right to reinstatement; it is only if he <span class="SpellE">unjustifiedly</span>
or unreasonably refuses to report for work with his former employer after his
reinstatement has been ordered or after his employer has offered to reinstate
him pur­suant to the judgment of the court that he could be con­sidered as
having renounced such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bare
fact of his being actually employed elsewhere in any capacity cannot affect his
right to reinstatement, for the option is his to return or not to return to his
former work upon knowing of the order or offer of reinstatement; if he opts to
return, he has to be reinstated, subject to the conditions as to his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> already elucidated above; if he refuses to return
or imposes uncalled for conditions <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, then and
only then would his right to reinstatement cease, although he would nonetheless
be entitled to the same <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> already discussed
up to the time of such refusal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
light of these crite­ria, the important question is, when should respondent be
considered as having waived her right to reinstatement, independently of when
she left for the United States and when she secured employment there, or, in
other words, when did she manifest her option to waive reinstatement either
expressly or by conduct unmistakably implying her option to forego the same?</p>

<p class="BODY">In this respect, according to the lower court, it is</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> not
denied that certain un­disputable developments took place in that (respondent) <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> went to the United States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a pleading filed with the Supreme Court
while this case was on appeal therein, a copy of which was furnished counsel
for <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> then in the United States, she was formally
asked to report for work the next day, June 15, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came back to the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, counsel for respondents met her at
the office of her lawyers and there she was told to re­port to respondents for
work, which she never did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, she
went to the United States."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Ordinarily, these findings of fact should
bind this Court, particularly because in unfair labor practice cases, the rule
to this effect in regard to cases appealed from the Court of Industrial
Relations which has long been established in the law and jurisprudence is
specifically reite­rated in Section 6 of the Industrial Peace Act thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The findings of the (Indus­trial) Court with respect to
questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record shall be
conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal to the Supreme
Court shall be limited to questions of law only."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In this case, however, the record reveals
that it is equal­ly undisputed that upon receipt of the offer of reinstate­ment,
which, by the way, was actually made on July 14,1966 or already after this Court
had rendered its judgment of April 30, 1966, respondent's counsel lost no time
in mani­festing that she was</p>

<blockquote>"willing to be reinstated to her former position but not with
the monthly salary she was receiv­ing on the date of her dismissal (as
stipulated in the offer).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­spondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> should receive a monthly salary of P295.00 plus the
yearly general wage increases from 1958 to 1965 given by the petitioners to all
its employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To serve as gauge of what
respond­ent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> should receive as month­ly salary
effective on the date of her reinstatement, the respond­ents respectfully
inform the Honor­able Tribunal that the employee who replaced respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in her position is presently receiv­ing the monthly
salary of P425.00, whereas at the time she assumed said position she was
receiving the monthly salary of P250.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and that, in turn, counsel for
petitioners counter-manifested that pursuant to the decision of this Court
affirm­ing that of the lower court all that was ordered was that respondent be
reinstated "to her former position with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from September 1, 1958 until actually reinstated, with all the rights and
privileges acquired and due her, including seniority and such <u>other terms
and conditions of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>employment existing at
the time of her lay-off</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Otherwise stated, it was not exactly true that re­spondent
disregarded petitioners' offer for reinstatement, as the lower court's finding
would seem to imply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
she indicated readiness to accept the same but; rather over-cautiously, she
wanted to be sure first that she was not going to lose any of the other rights
she wad accorded by the standing judgment in her favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For their part, petitioners must have been
motivated by the same feeling when they filed their counter-manifestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While their respective positions are somehow
understandable, it cannot be said that either of them acted in accordance with
the spirit of the law; and much less the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already explained above, under the
circumstances, what the court should have immediately done was to forthwith
implement the order of reinstatement, and the parties should have known better
than not to trust that the court would resolve all matters relative to the
other parts of the judgment in accordance with the law and jurisprudence
discussed above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reiterate that the
implementation of an order of reinstatement should not be delayed, much less
subjected to conditions proposed by the parties but not consistent with the
judgment and manifestly <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of their substantial
rights, since long periods of unjustified and illegal lay-offs are economically
and socially unwise and prejudicial to everyone concerned, most importantly to
the laboring or working classes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the circumstances of this particular case, We hold that
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> should have seen to it that respondent returned
to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by the earliest reasonable means as soon as she was notified of the judgment of
this Court and the offer of petitioners to rein­state her and reported for work
as soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She should not have
been allowed to quibble about the terms of her reinstatement, nor the
petitioners to qualify the same, since the judgment and the law and
jurisprudence regarding them had necessarily to be followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, to avoid further delay as regards this
particular point, all relevant things extant in the record considered, We hold
that respondent <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> is entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, computed together with her other rights and
privileges as above indicated, from the date of her dismissal to the date she
left the Philippines to return to the United States to resume her teaching job
thereat, which date she should reveal to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> with
competent proof, subject to verification by petitioners and the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By failing to report for work with
petitioners when she had an opportunity to do so and leaving instead for the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> with intent to resume her teaching
job, she must be deemed to have effectively waived reinstate­ment by
petitioners from said date.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent her earnings here and/or abroad during the period of her
lay-off, the motion to compute the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due the
respondent was filed as early as June 8, 1966 and it was only after almost a
year, or on May 12, 1967, that the trial judge resolved the matter and only
shortly before May 23, 1968<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that the court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> rendered the decision now on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such delay is, to say the least, deplorable,
if only because the reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is that in
dealing with the issues before it, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> failed to
adhere to the spirit and intent of the legal provisions aforementioned
prescribing the procedure for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record evinces an unex­plainable indifference on the part of the
trial judge in the face of the technical maneuvers of the parties not in
keeping with the nature of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each kept urging the other to prove facts, which each one knew very well
was within its own peculiar knowledge, and the court did nothing to compel both
of them to be more ho­nest and candid to it by disclosing the real facts within
their respective peculiar knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, instead of requiring petitioners to reveal on the basis of their
records what general increases, benefits and bonuses were granted to their
employees which respondent would have been entitled to share had she not been
laid-off, the Court merely waited for evidence to be presented by the
respondent, only to later on disregard them, rightly or wrongly, as
incompetent, by applying the strict rules of evidence for ordinary courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the rul­ing of the lower court
denying respondent's claim for fringe benefits, etc. on the ground that she
"did not present evidence in support" thereof cannot stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, when it came to the turn of the peti­tioners to prove
respondent's earnings during the lay­off period, the court made no move to
compel respondent to disclose the facts pertinent thereto which were within her
peculiar knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the situation in
which petitioners were found, it was only natural that they had to depend on
affidavits and certifications from knowledgeable people in the United States,
the taking of depositions thereat or the bringing here of competent witnesses
and records for the purpose being obviously impractical, but the court below
ruled out said affidavits and certifications, holding in utter non-<span class="SpellE">chalance</span>, surely unjustified, that</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> when the
respondents (herein petitioners) were given the opportunity to present compe­tent
evidence in support of their allegations that complainant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
earned (that amount) during the time of her dismissal, they failed to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged affidavits attached to
the various manifesta­tions filed with this Court were not even identified by
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that such alleged
affidavits are merely pieces of paper and do not have any value as evidence, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">which holding is not even correct,
considering that in Luzon Brokerage Co. v. Luzon Labor Union, G. R. No. L-­17085,
<st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date>, 8 SCRA 509,
510, a case involving also <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, We ruled
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"an affidavit is admis­sible
as evidence before the Court of Industrial Rela­tions for the reason that the
same is an administrative body."</p>

<p class="BODY">Worse, when petitioners availed a request for ad­missions, the
trial judge failed to observe the proce­dure governing this means of discovery
existing under the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that in their effort to prove the earnings of respondent during the
lay-off, pe­titioners made a request to respondent for admission of pertinent
facts such as:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1962</st1:date>, you were employed by Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., at a monthly
salary of P215.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="6">June
 1, 1962</st1:date>, your above monthly salary in the said firm was increased
to P250.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1964</st1:date>, you volun­tarily resigned your said position in Warner,
Barnes &amp; Co.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the entire period of your employment by
Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., you received during the periods mentioned hereinabove
the salary referred to hereinabove.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, during the pe­riod of your
employment by Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., you were granted Christmas bonuses,
vacation leave and all other privileges incidental to your employment by said
company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After resigning from your position on <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1964</st1:date>, you left for the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> with your children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, you are now a permanent
resident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, you have been employed by a teach­ing
institution and/or by travel agency, receiving from these two sources a total
income in dollars which when translated to pesos ex­ceeds the amount that you
would have received during the entire pe­riod of your separation from ser­vice
of the East Asiatic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You returned to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
this year during the school summer vacation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and left again some time ago for the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> to resume your various
employments."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Instead of complying with said request,
respondent filed a reply excusing herself from compliance by contending that:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the matters treated in the request are
improper and irrelevant at this stage of the proceed­ing in this case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That request for admission is proper only
after issues have been joined and before any decision is issued in the case and
not after the decision has been promulgated and has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To be sure, there was some deviation by
both parties from the procedure prescribed by Rule 26, since such a request
need not have been filed with the court and should have been addressed directly
to the respondent instead of her being merely furnished with copy thereof, and,
on the other hand, instead of the "reply" of respondent excusing
herself on the above-quoted grounds, the said grounds should have been
submitted formally for the resolution of the court as objections to the
request, pursuant to Sec­tion 2 of said rule, but such departure was no excuse
for the court not to play the part designed for it by Common­wealth Act 103 and
the Industrial Peace Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
ignoring the formal departure by the parties from Rule 26 and considering the
reply of respondent as her objection to the request for admission and correspondingly
ruling thereon so that the parties may be guided accordingly, the trial judge
appears to have completely disregarded both the request and the reply and did
not even make any men­tion thereof in his final order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said attitude is clear­ly erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discovery procedures authorized by the
Rules of Court are by their very nature precisely suitable to proceedings of
the kind now before Us, since the main objective of discovery is to enable one
party to acquire knowledge of relevant facts which otherwise would be in the
peculiar knowledge of the adverse party alone and for that party to afterwards
make use of such acquired know­ledge either as evidence itself or as a means of
prepar­ing evidence in its favor, and it is in proceedings for the determination
of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in cases of reinstatement of illegally
discharged employees that the parties usual­ly indulge in the practice of
unnecessarily trying to conceal evidentiary facts from each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, under the broad control
that the Industrial Court has over procedural matters and in order to expe­dite
proceedings and go directly to the substantial me­rits of the claims of the
parties, it can even adjust and modify the application of the modes of
discovery in cases before it accordingly as the demands of the particular
situation before it may require</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, respondent's above-quoted grounds of objection to
petitioners' request are obviously untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that as a rule, discovery is best used before or during
the trial and before judgment, there can be no valid objection to allow
recourse thereto in proceedings in aid of execution of a judgment when the need
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> arises because of the material issues of
fact more or less numerous or complicated, as in the case at bar, and specially
in cases before the Court of Indus­trial Relations wherein the court is free to
adopt the procedure it deems most conducive to attain its objective under the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, respondent's
objections should have been overruled and she should have been prompt­ly
ordered to properly reply to the petitioners' request for admissions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing, We have no recourse but to return
this case to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may entail further delay, but We have no
alternative because even the facts which petitioners requested to be admitted
are not as sufficiently detail­ed as to accurately and comprehensively include
all the circumstances of respondent's employment and earnings during the
lay-off period in question; hence, even if We were to hold, as was prayed for
by petitioners in the court below, that the said facts be deemed admitted pur­suant
to Section 2 of Rule 26, in view of respondent's failure to properly comply
with petitioners' request and considering that anyway, her objections to the
request are completely untenable, there would still be no basis for a complete
judgment in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before closing, however, We consider it necessary to advert to
the attempt of the Court Examiner assigned to compute the income of respondent
from her employment in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to determine the peso value of said income by multiplying her dollar earnings
by the rate of exchange of the American dollar to the Philippine peso.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a method of computation is uncalled for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While viewed in terms of the rate of exchange
of our peso to the U.S. dollar, one's income in the United States may appear to
be lucrative compared to one's income in the Philippines, not to be overlooked
is the fact that, in more or less similar proportion, the living expenses and
the standard of living in said country are also relatively high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, dollar earnings should not be
computed on any exchange rate basis at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, as a result of the erroneous basis thus used by the
Court Examiner, he also concluded that what respondent earned in the United
States is equiva­lent to P36,190.00, and since this is more than P30,190.00,
the total, according to his computation, of what respondent would have earned
from petitioners from the date of her dismissal to the date of computation,
respondent is no longer entitled to any payment from pe­titioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, this method of computation is erro­neous.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, Northwest Airlines Employees Asso­ciation vs.
Northwest Airlines, Inc., <u>supra</u>, while not exactly identical in
circumstances with this case, in­dicates the governing, principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, peti­tioner was a permanent
employee - as a flight steward­ess with a salary of P445.07 a month - of
therein re­spondent Northwest Airlines, Inc. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The company dismissed her from its service on <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1960</st1:date>, in conse­quence
of which, petitioner filed an unfair labor prac­tice charge with the Court of
Industrial Relations against said respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1962</st1:date>,
while the case was pending in the CIR, petitioner applied to and was reemployed
by the same company on a temporary basis as passenger sales agent with the same
monthly salary of P445.07.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This,
notwithstanding, petitioner pursued her case further; and on September 30,
1963, the CIR decided the same, finding the respondent company guilty of the
unfair labor practice charge and ordering it to rein­state her to her former
job as flight stewardess "with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and without loss to (sic) her seniority and other acquired rights therein."
When the company moved to reconsider, the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolved
that pe­titioner should be paid <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from
September 24, 1960, the day after her dismissal, to June, 1962, when she was
reemployed on temporary basis, and, as it was shown that petitioner received a
number of salary increases as passenger sales agent, ordered that "the ex­cess
over P445.07 that she received from the company under the new designation
should also be deducted" from said <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on August 9, 1965, when pursuant to a
motion for execution pending appeal, petitioner was reinstated to her former
position of flight steward­ess, she was paid her back salaries for the period
of her lay-off (from September 23, 1960 to June 27, 1962) at the rate of
P445.07 a month, minus all that she had received in excess of that rate during
the period of her employment as passenger sales agent from June 28, 1962 to
August 8, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of this
deduction was put in issue in the petition with this Court and We held:</p>

<blockquote>"The first issue raised in this petition is the validity of
such de­duction as ordered in the respond­ent Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To justify the said order the respondent
company cites seve­ral decisions of this Court (Philip­pine Airlines vs. PALEA,
L-15544, July 26, 1960, 60 O.G. 8269; MacLeod &amp; Co. vs. Progressive Federa­tion
of Labor, L-7881, May 31, 1955; Western Mindanao Lumber Co., Inc. vs. Western
Mindanao Federation of Labor, L-10170, April 25, 1957), wherein it was held
that whatever the dismissed laborers had actually earned during the period of
their illegal dismissal should be deduct­ed, on the principle that no one
should be allowed to enrich him­self at the expense of another.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Several reasons militate against the application of those
decisions in the case now before us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, whatever Louise <span class="SpellE">Mateu</span> earned during the
time she was work­ing as passenger sales agent was for services rendered to the
re­spondent company; she did not un­duly enrich herself at its expense in being
paid for them; on the contrary, it is the company that would be unduly enriched
if, after having received the benefit of such services, it should be allowed to
pay less than what they were worth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, since the parties are agreed that the period of the peti­tioner's
dismissal was only from <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="9">September 23,
 1960</st1:date> to June 1962, and since she was adjudged entitled to back
salaries only during such period, there is neither logic nor equity in taking
into account, for purposes of deduction the income she received
thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, We cannot see any justification for Us to uphold here
the Examiner's theory and virtually allow petitioners to escape the sanction
intended by the law for the unfair labor practice they were found guilty of by
final judgment of this Court, specially because to adopt such view would enable
petitioners in effect to enrich themselves from what the very victim of their
un­just and illegal act of dismissing her without suffi­cient cause earned thru
her own work and effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed
the height of inequity and injustice for any em­ployer to take advantage of a
favorable turn of fortune of his worker, laborer or employee he has dismissed
in violation of law and use such lucky break to elude the penalty provided by
the law for such violation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be
a travesty of the Constitutional injunction that "the State shall afford
protection to labor (Section 6, Art. XIV, Constitution of the Philippines) if
the principle that a party damaged by another has the obligation to try to
minimize his damages were to be extended in the sense that what a laborer or
employee, after being op­pressed and illegally treated by his employer, has
earned by his own efforts, over and above the wages or salaries such employer
would have paid him had he not been laid off should be used in reducing the
award of damages to the worker.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the just and equitable rule re­garding the point
under discussion is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
obligation of the employer to pay an illegally dismissed employee or worker the
whole amount of the salaries or wages, plus all other benefits and bonuses and
general increases, to which he would have been normally entitled had he not
been dismissed and had not stopped working, but it is the right, on the other
hand, of the employer to deduct from the total of these, the amount equivalent
to the salaries or wages the employee or worker would have earned in his old
employment on the corresponding days that he was actually gainfully employed
elsewhere with an equal or higher salary or wage, such that if his salary or
wage in his other employment was less, the em­ployer may deduct only what has
been actually earned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, if
the lay-off period is one year and the monthly salary of the employee or worker
is P300.00, which is equivalent to P10.00 a day, he would be enti­tled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of P3,600.00, plus benefits, bonuses and general
increases, but, if during the year of lay­off, he was employed off and on, and
at one time earned P12.00 a day but at another time only P8.00 a day, what
should be deducted would be P10.00 for everyday that he was earning P12.00 and
only P8.00 for everyday that he was earning such amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, all earning of the
dismissed employee or worker elsewhere over and above what he would have earned
with his old employer dur­ing the corresponding period belong to the employee
or worker to the exclusion of any right on the part of the employer to use the
same to minimize the damages he has to pay.</p>
