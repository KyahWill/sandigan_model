<p class="BODY">Petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Baldisimo</span> is the
plaintiff in Civil Case No. V-438 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, where he seeks to recover from respondent Angel <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> the ownership and possession of a par­cel of land
described in his complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial,
the lower court, on <st1:date year="1953" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1953</st1:date>,
adjudicated to petitioner only a portion of the land sought <span style="">to </span>be re­covered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On appeal to the Court of
Appeals, by both parties (docketed as CA-G.</span> R. No. 14853-R), the appel­late
court rendered a decision, dated <st1:date year="1957" day="22" month="10">October
 22, <span style="">1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>awarding the whole property in
litigation to petitioner <span style="">and declaring
him entitled to its possession; the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For all them forgoing considerations, plaintiff Enrique <span class="SpellE">Baldisimo</span> is hereby declared owner of <span style="">the western </span>portion with an area of
86,504 square meters, of the whole land indicated in the plan, Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The eastern por­tion of the land, with an <span style="">area </span>of
39,127 square meters, properly belongs to de­fendant Angel <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Hilaria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ongas</span> the boundary line between the land of plaintiff
and that of defend­ant is a line drawn northward from a point (which used to be
an old culvert) 60 <span style="">meters </span>west along the provincial road from point 1 in the plan,
Exhibit A.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the circumstances, defendant Angel <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span>
should not be made to pay damages because he is a possessor in good faith. He
took possession of plain­tiff's land under the mistaken belief that it was part
of the land he bought from the <span class="SpellE">Ongas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the fishpond constructed <span style="">by </span>defendant on plaintiff's land, the
plaintiffs may take one of two alternatives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He may elect to refund to defendant the expenses he incurred in
constructing said fishpond or the increases in value which the land <span style="">acquired </span>by
reason of the construction of the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such a case, defendant has the right to retain the property until he
has been reimbursed (Article 546, New Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or plaintiff may choose to oblige defendant to
buy the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case,
however, if the value of the land is considerably more than the fish­pond,
defendant cannot be made to <span style="">buy </span>the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the plaintiff does not <span style="">wish </span>to appropriate the fishpond after
paying the proper indemnity then defendant must pay reasonable rent for the use
of plaintiff's land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff and
defendant shall agree upon the terra of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of <span style="">disagreement, the lower court is hereby instructed to fix the terms
thereof (Article 448, New Civil Code).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Premises considered<span class="GramE">,</span> the appealed
decision is hereby modified as hereto­fore indicated, without any pronounce­ment
as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court <u>a</u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>
is </span>hereby instruct­ed to appoint a commissioner who shall be present
during the survey and division of the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The division there­of shall be accomplished
in the following <span style="">manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From a point </span>60 meters west to point <span style="">1 (in </span>the plan, Exhibit A), a line
shall be drawn northward, which line shall divide the land into two, such that
at the western portion thereof shall have an area of 86,504 square meters,
while the eastern portion thereof shall have an area of 39,127 square
meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the plain­tiff's
land is much bigger than that of defendant, he shall bear two-thirds of the <span style="">expenses for</span> survey and division,
while defendant Angel <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> shall bear one-third
of such expenses."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant </span>to the
foregoin<span style="">g</span> <span style="">j</span>udgment, <span style="">the case was </span>remanded to <span style="">the
</span>trial court for further proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baldisimo</span> elected to <span style="">refund respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span>
of the reasonable expenses</span> incurred by the latter in the <span style="">construction </span>of <span style="">the Fishpond on the land </span>in <span style="">question, pursuant </span>to the decision<span style=""> of the Court of </span>Ap<span style="">p</span>eals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidence was <span style="">presented by both
parties </span><span style="">re</span><span style="">garding</span> the expenses incurred in the
construction of the fishpond, <span style="">and the </span>respondent
trial court, on <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1962</st1:date>,
r<span style="">endered a supplemental decision, the </span><span class="SpellE">dis<span style="">positive</span></span>
portion of which reads as follows: </p>

<blockquote>“1. Declaring the defendant ANGEL <span style="">ARBOLEDA </span>entitled to the refund of his expenses for <span style="">the </span>construction of the fishpond In
question in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,958.07</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. Ordering the plaintiff ENRIQUE BALDISIMO to pay the said
defendant the amount aforementioned; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“3. Without additional pronounce­ment as to
costs."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above-stated supplemental decision pe­titioner appealed
to the Court of Appeals (docketed as CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 31563-R),
alleging that the appraisal by the lower court of the expenses for the
construct­ion of the fishpond is excessive and unfair.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respond­ent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span>
did not appeal from the supplemental de­cision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 22, 1963, or during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the appeal, petitioner deposited with the respondent court the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,958.07</span>, which is the amount fixed by said court to be
refunded by petitioner to respondent, at the <span style="">same time </span>notifying the latter of the
deposit and urging said respondent to collect said amount so <span style="">that possession </span>of
the land in question may be deli­vered to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span>
failed to collect the amount deposited and he refused to deliver <span style="">possession </span>of
the property in question to petitioner, petitioner filed several motions before
the respondent court praying that respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboledo</span>
be ordered to withdraw the money deposited with the court and that a writ of
execution be issued for the delivery of <span style="">the possession </span>of the land in question to
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These motions having been
denied, peti­tioner instituted the instant petition for mandamus before this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason advanced by respondent court in re­fusing to order
respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> to collect the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,958.07</span> deposited by petitioner and in refusing to <span style="">issue </span>a writ
of execution in favor of the latter is the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of petitioner's appeal with the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said court, as long as
petitioner insists in prosecuting his appeal from the supplemental decision,
respondent can lawfully reject the tender of payment by petitioner and that the
mate­rial possession of the land in controversy cannot be delivered to the
latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The stand taken by respondent court cannot be <span style="">sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appeal of the petitioner from the supplemental decision of
respondent court of June 29, 1962 simply involves the reasonableness of the
amount fixed as the value of the improvements introduced by respond­ent on
petitioner's land, which the latter is ordered </span>to refund to the
former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ownership of the land, and
naturally its possession which is an attribute thereto, is not being questioned
in the appeal, since the Court of Appeals in its decision dated October 22, 1957
had already declared petitioner the owner of the <span class="SpellE">contro­verted</span>
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is this decision of the
court of Appeals which petitioner sought to enforce by asking the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> to place him in possession of the land, contending that the decision
had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and that he
had complied with the terms of the judgment regarding the refund of the
expenses incurred by respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> in the
construction of the fishpond on the land in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the circumstances,
as recited in the fore­going paragraphs, </span>We <span style="">believe that the petitioner is en­titled to be placed in possession of
the entire </span>property <span style="">under
litigation, and in refusing to issue the writ to </span>execute the decision of
the Court of Appeals respondent court had unlawfully neglected to perform an
act which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the petitioner had appealed
from the supplemental decision, but under Section 9, Rule 41 of the Rules of
Court, it is within the power of the trial court to issue orders for the
protection and preservation of the rights of the parties which do not involve
any matter litigated in the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
petitioners asked respondent <span style="">court - </span>which
respondent court neg<span style="">lected or refused
to do - was to order the delivery to petitioners </span>of the land where the
fishpond is located, a step that <span style="">was
merely designed to </span>protect and deserve <span style="">the </span>of <span style="">petitioner
regardless</span> of <span style="">the result</span>
the appeal from the supplemental decision - the rights<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petitioners to posses the land <span style="">where </span>the fishpond is located not<span style=""> </span>being litigated i<span style="">n</span>
<span style="">said </span><span style="">appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is </span>so <span style="">in spite of the provision of Article 546 of</span>
them Civil Code, as mentioned in the decision of the Court<span style=""> of </span>Appeals, that respondent has the
right to retain <span style="">the possession of the
premises until after he is reimburse of his expenses in the construction of the
fishpond - he having constructed the fishpond in good faith - be­cause the
petitioner had already deposited in court </span>the amount of P2,958.07 which
the trial court had declared as the reasonable expenses incurred by respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> in the construction of the fishpond, which amount
said respondent can collect or withdrawn any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the tender was made under
protest in the sense that petitioner appealed the appraisal made by the lower
court, and petitioner refused to withdraw his appeal, is of no moment as the
full expenses for the construction of the fishpond to be refunded to respond­ent
<span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> was already consigned in court and <span style="">was </span>at his
disposal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>have adverted to, respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> <span style="">did </span>not
appeal from the supplemental decision of the lower court, and so he could not
be awarded by the appellate court more than what <span style="">was </span>ordered refunded to him <span style="">in </span>said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, regardless of the outcome of the
appeal, respondent <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> cannot be prejudiced if
pos­session of the property is delivered to petitioner, be­cause said
respondent's rights are duly protected <span style="">by
the</span> amount of P2,958.07 already consigned in court by peti­tioner and
made available to him any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
shows that petitioner had been deprived of the premises for almost <span style="">sixteen years</span> up to the time when the
judgment of the Court of<span style=""> </span>Appeals
was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a compelling
circumstance that warrants the issuance of the writ of execution prayed for by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, indeed, no excuse to keep
petitioner waiting for the outcome of the appeal from the supplemental deci­sion,
which obviously will not affect his right to the possession of the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court can not,
in justice, continue to withhold from petitioner the possession of the land
where the fishpond <span style="">is </span>located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delivery
of the possession of that property to him has long been overdue, and to deny
him that possession under the circumstances is to exclude him from the use and
enjoyment of a right to which he is entitled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, the remedy of mandamus should be made availably to
petitioner, as prayed for by him in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for a writ <span style="">of </span>Mandamus is granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent court is commanded to <span style="">issue
</span>a writ of execution to enforce the decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G. R. No. L-14853-R (Civil Case V-438 of respondent court), by ordering
respondent Angel <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> to collect the amount of
P2,958.07 deposited in court by petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Baldisimo</span>
and ordering the delivery to <span style="">said </span>petitioner
of the possession of the <span style="">whole land
involved in </span>said case, including the fish­pond mentioned in this
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement a<span style="">s</span> to costs.</p>
