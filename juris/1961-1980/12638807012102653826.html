M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc., dismissing the complaint of appellant Cruz
for the recovery of improvements he has made on <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
land and to compel <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to convey to him 3,000
square meters of land on three grounds: (1) failure of the complaint to state a
cause of action; (2) the cause of action of plaintiff is unenforceable under
the Statute of Frauds; and (3) the action of the plaintiff has already
prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Actually, a perusal of plaintiff-appellant's complaint below
shows that he alleged two separate causes of action, namely: (1) that upon
request of the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> (the family of <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> who laid <span style="">claim </span>on the land in question on the
strength of an "information <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span>")
plaintiff made permanent improvements valued at <span style="">P30,400.00 </span>on said land having an area of more or less 20 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> and for which he also incurred expenses in the
amount of P7,781.74, and since defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
are being benefited by said improvements, he is entitled to reimbursement from
them of said amounts; and (2) that in 1952, defendants availed of plaintiff's
services as an intermediary with the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> to work
for the amicable settlement of Civil Case No. Q-135, then pending also in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, and involving
50 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> of land, of which the 20 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> aforementioned form part, and notwithstanding his
having performed his services, as in fact, a compromise agreement entered into
on March 16, 1963 between the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> and the
defendants was approved by the court, the latter have refused to convey to him
the 3,000 square meters of land occupied by him, (a part of the 20 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> above) which said defendants had promised to do
"within ten years from and after date of signing of the compromise
agreement", as consideration for his services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Within the period allowed by the rules, the defendants filed
separate motions to dismiss alleging three identical grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) As regards the improvements made by
plaintiff, that the complaint states no cause of action, the agreement
regarding the same having been made by plaintiff with the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
and not with the defendants, hence the theory of plaintiff based on Article
2142 of the Civil Code on unjust enrichment is untenable; and (2) anent the
alleged agreement about plaintiff's services as intermediary in consideration
of which, defendants promised to convey to him 3,000 square meters of land,
that the same is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, there being nothing
in writing about it, and, in any event, (3) that the action of plaintiff to
compel such conveyance has already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff opposed the motion insisting that Article 2142 of the
Civil Code is applicable to his case; that the Statute of Frauds cannot be
invoked by defendants, not only because Article 1403 of the Civil Code refers
only to "sale of real property or of an interest therein" and not to
promises to convey real property like the one supposedly promised by defendants
to him, but also because, he, the plaintiff has already performed his part of
the agreement, hence the agreement has already been partly executed and not
merely <span class="SpellE">executory</span> within the contemplation of the
Statute; and that his action has not prescribed for the reason that defendants
had ten years to comply and only after the said ten years did his cause of
action accrue, that <span style="">is, </span>ten years after March 16, 1963, the date of the approval of
the compromise agreement, and his complaint was filed on January 24, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruling on the motion to dismiss, the trial court issued the
herein impugned order of <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="8">August 13,
 1964</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"In the motion, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="1">January
 31, 1964</st1:date>, defendant Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Inc. prayed that the complaint against it be dismissed on the ground that (1)
the claim on which the action is founded is unenforceable under the provision
of the Statute of Frauds; and (2) the plaintiff's action, if any has already
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the other motion of <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1964</st1:date>, defendant J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Co., Inc. sought the dismissal of the plaintiff's
complaint on the ground that it states no cause of action and on the identical
grounds stated in the motion to dismiss of defendant Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said motions are duly opposed by the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the allegations of the complaint, it appears that, by
virtue of an agreement arrived at in 1948 by the plaintiff and the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, the former assisted the latter in clearing,
improving, subdividing and selling the <span style="">large
tract of land consisting of 50 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> covered by
the <span class="SpellE"><u>informacion</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></u>
in the name of the late <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
and incurred expenses, which are valued approximately at P38,400.00 and
P7,781.74, respectively; and, for the reasons that </span>said improvements are
being used and enjoyed by the defendants, the plaintiff is seeking the
reimbursement for the services and expenses stated above from the defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; <span style="">Co., </span>Inc. claimed that, insofar as the
plaintiff's claim for the reim­bursement of the amounts of <span style="">P38,400.00 and P7,781.74 </span>is concerned,
it is <span style="">not a privy to the plaintiff's
agreement </span>to <span style="">assist the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> </span>in im­proving the 50 <span class="SpellE">quinones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the plaintiff countered
that, by holding and utilizing the improvements introduced by him, the
defendants are unjustly enriching and benefiting at the expense of the
plaintiff; and that said improvements constitute a lien or charge on the
property itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the issue that the complaint insofar as it claims the
reimbursement for the services rendered and expenses incurred <span style="">by </span>the plaintiff, states no cause of
action, the Court is of the opinion that the same is well-founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is found that the defendants are not
parties to the supposed express contract entered into by and between the plaintiff
and the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> for the clearing and improvement of
the 50 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore in order that the alleged improvement may be considered a
lien or charge on the property, the same should have been made in good faith
and under the mistake as to the title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court can take judicial notice of the fact that the tract of land
supposedly improved by the plaintiff had been registered way back in 1914 in
the name of the predecessors-in-interest of defendant J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is confirmed
in the decision rendered by the Supreme Court on <st1:date year="1956" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1956</st1:date> in case G. R. No. L-5079 entitled 'J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Geronimo Santiago, et al'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, the plaintiff cannot
claim good faith and mistake as to the title of the land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the issue of statute of fraud, the Court believes that
same is applicable to the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The allegation in par. 12 of the complaint states that the defendants
promised and agreed to cede, transfer and convey unto the plaintiff the 3,000
square meters of land in consideration of certain services to be rendered
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the alleged
agreement involves an interest in real property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the provisions of Sec. 2(e) of Article
1403 of the Civil Code, such agreement is not enforceable as it is not in
writing and sub­scribed by the party charged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the issue of statute of limitations, the Court holds that
the plaintiff's action has prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is alleged in par. 11 of the complaint that, sometime in 1952, the
defendants approached the plaintiff to prevail upon the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
to enter into a compromise agreement in Civil Case No. Q-135 and allied
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, pars. 13 and 14 of
the complaint alleged that the plaintiff acted as emissary of both parties in
conveying their respective proposals and counter-proposals until the final
settlement was effected on <st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="3">March 16,
 1953</st1:date> and approved by the Court on <st1:date year="1953" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the present action, which was instituted on <span style="">January 24, 1964, the </span>plaintiff is seeking to enforce the
supposed agreement entered into between him and the defendants in 1952, which
has already prescribed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the plaintiff's complaint is hereby ordered
DISMISSED without pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"SO ORDERED." </span>(Pp.
65-69, Rec. on Appeal.)</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'On the issue of the statute of limitations, the Court holds that
the plaintiff's action has prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is alleged in par. 11 of the complaint that, sometime in 1952, the

to enter into a compromise agreement in Civil Case No. Q-135 and allied
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, pars. 13 and 14 of
the complaint alleged that plaintiff acted as emissary of both parties in
conveying their respective proposals and counter-proposals until the final

11, 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present action, which
was instituted on January 24, 1964, the plaintiff is seeking to enforce the
supposed agreement entered into between him and the defendants in 1952, which
has already prescribed. ' (at p. 3, Order).</p>

<blockquote>"The present action has not prescribed, especially when we
consider carefully the terms of the agreement between plaintiff and the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, we must draw the
attention of this Honorable Court to the fact that this is an action to compel
defendants to execute a Deed of Conveyance over the 3,000 sq. ms. subject of
their agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In paragraph 12 of the
complaint, the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties are

be executed and delivered by defendants to plaintiff <u>within ten (10) years
from and after date of signing of the co</u><u><span style="">mpromise agreement.</span></u><span style="">'
</span>(Italics Ours).</p>

<blockquote>"The compromise agreement between defendants and the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> which was con­cluded through the efforts of
plaintiff, was signed on 16 March 1953.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the defendants had ten (10) years from said date within which
to execute the deed of conveyance in favor of plaintiff over the 3,000 sq.

has not expired, plaintiff had no right to compel defendants to execute the
document and the latter were under no obligation to do so</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, this 10-year period elapsed on March 16,
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THEN and ONLY THEN <u>does
plaintiff's cause of action against defendants accrue</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, <u>the period of prescription
began to run against plaintiff only on March 17, 1963</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under paragraph 15 of the complaint
(supra) plaintiff made demands upon defendants for the execution of the deed
'in or about the middle of 1963.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with appellant that the Statute of Frauds was
erroneously applied by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is elementary that the Statute refers to specific kinds of
transactions and that it cannot apply to any that is not enumerated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the only agreements or contracts covered
thereby are the following:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those entered into in the name of another

subscribed by the party charged, or by his agent; evidence, therefore, of the
agreement cannot be received without the writing, or a secondary evidence of
its contents:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An agreement that by its terms is not to be
performed within a year from the making thereof;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A special promise to answer for the debt,
default, or miscarriage of another;</p>

or pay at the </span>time some part of the purchase money; but when a sale is
made by auction and entry is made by the auctioneer in his sales book, at the
time of the sale, of the amount and kind of property sold, terms of sale,
price, names of the purchasers and person on whose account the sale is made, it
is a sufficient memorandum;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An agreement for the leasing for a longer
period than one year, or for the sale of real property or of an interest
therein;</p>

person.</p>

<blockquote>"(3) Those
where both parties are incapable of giving consent to a contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1403, Civil Code.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, what appellant is trying to enforce is the
delivery to him of 3,000 square meters of land which he claims defendants
promised to do in consideration of his services as mediator or intermediary in
effecting a compromise of the civil action, Civil Case No. 135, between the
defendants and the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In no sense may such alleged contract be
considered as being a "sale of real property or of any interest
therein." Indeed, not all dealings involving interest in real property
come under the Statute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, appellant's complaint clearly alleges that he has
already fulfilled his part of the bargain to induce the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
to amicably settle their differences with defendants as, in fact, on March 16,
1963, through his efforts, a compromise agreement between these parties was
approved by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
the agreement in question has already been partially consummated, and is no
longer merely <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is likewise a fundamental principle
governing the application of the Statute that the contract in dispute should be
purely <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on the part of both parties thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot, however, escape taking judicial notice, in relation to
the compromise agreement relied upon by appellant, that in several cases We
have decided, We have declared the same rescinded and of no effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>,
4 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 123, the Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is also worthy of note that the compromise between <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, upon which <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span> predicates his right to buy the lot he
occupies, has been validly rescinded and set aside, as recognized by this Court
in its decision in G. R. No. L-13768, <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, promulgated on May 30, 1961."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We repeated this observation in J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span>
Macalindong,6 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 938.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, viewed from what would be the ultimate
conclusion of appellant's case, We entertain grave doubts as to whether or not
he can successfully maintain his alleged cause of action against defendants,
considering that the compromise agreement that he invokes did not actually
materialize and defendants have not benefited <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
not to mention the undisputed fact that, as pointed out by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
appellant's other attempt to secure the same 3, 000 square meters via the
judicial enforcement of the compromise agreement in which they were supposed to
be reserved for him has already been repudiated by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 5-7, Brief of <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc. )</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards appellant's third assignment of error, We hold that
the allegations in his complaint do not sufficiently constitute a cause of
action against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's reliance on Article 2142 of Civil
Code is misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said article
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Certain lawful, voluntary and unilateral acts give rise to
the juridical relation of quasi-contract to the end that no one shall be
unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the very language of this provision, it is obvious that a
presumed quasi-contract cannot emerge as against one party when the subject
matter thereof is already covered by an existing contract with another
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Predicated on the principle that
no one should be allowed to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of another,
Article 2142 creates the legal fiction of a quasi-contract precisely because of
the absence of any actual agreement between the parties concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>, if the
one who claims having enriched somebody has done so pursuant to a contract with
a third party, his cause of action should be against the latter, who in turn
may, if there is any ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, seek relief
against the party benefited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
essential that the act by which the defendant is benefited must have been
voluntary and unilateral on the part of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As one distinguished civilian puts it,
"The act is voluntary, because, the actor in quasi-contracts is not bound
by any pre-existing obligation to act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is unilateral, because it arises from the sole will of the actor who
is not previously bound by any reciprocal or bilateral agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason why the law creates a juridical
relation and imposes certain obligations is to prevent a situation where a
person is able to benefit or take advantage of such lawful, voluntary and
unilateral acts at the expense of said actor." (<span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
Padilla, Civil Law, Vol. VI, p. 748, 1969 ed.) In the case at bar, since
appellant has a clearer and more direct recourse against the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> with whom he had entered into an agreement
regarding the improve­ments and expenditures made by him on the land of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, it cannot be said, in the sense contemplated in
Article 2142, that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have been enriched at
the expense of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the ultimate, therefore, Our holding above that appellant's
first two assignments of error are well taken cannot save the day for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from his having no cause of action
against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, there is one plain error of
omission We have found in the order of the trial court which is as good a
ground as any other for Us to terminate this case favorably to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said
order which We have quoted in full earlier in this opinion, the trial court
ruled that "the grounds relied upon in said motion are mere repetitions of
those already resolved and discussed by this Court in the order of August 13,
1964", an observation which We fully share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Virtually, therefore, appellant's motion for
reconsideration was ruled to be pro-forma.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, a cursory reading of the record on appeal reveals that
appellant's motion for reconsideration above-quoted contained exactly the same
arguments and manner of discussion as his February 6, 1964 "Opposition to
Motion to Dismiss" of defendant Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 17-25, Rec. on Appeal) as well
as his February 17, 1964 "Opposition to Motion to Dismiss of Defendant J.
M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co." (pp. 33-45, Rec. on Appeal)
and his February 29, 1964 "Rejoinder to Reply of Defendant J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. ".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(pp. 52-64, Rec. on Appeal) We cannot see anything in said motion for
reconsideration that is substantially different from the above oppositions and
rejoinder he had previously submitted and which the trial court had already
considered when it rendered its main order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, appellant's motion for
reconsideration did not suspend his period for appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Estrada vs. <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo, 28 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 890, 905-6.) And as this point was
covered by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' "Opposition to Motion for
Reconsideration" (pp. 86-89), hence, within the frame of the issues below,
it is within the ambit of Our authority as the Supreme Court to consider the
same here even if it is not discussed in the briefs of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. Employees

<p class="BODY">Now, the impugned main order was issued on August 13, 1964, while
the appeal was made on September 24, 1964 or 42 days later. Clearly, this is
beyond the 30-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for
