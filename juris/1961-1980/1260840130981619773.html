				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 27, 1951, petitioners Luis Sarabia and Jose Leido filed individual 
fishpond applications (Nos. 7304 and 7305) with the Bureau of Fisheries over 100 
hectares each of public land located in Barrio Nag-iba, Naujan, Oriental 
Mindoro. About a year later, on July 16, 1952, respondent Francisco B. 
Lardizabal filed a similar application (No. 8777) also covering public land 
located in the same barrio and municipality. At the time the three men filed 
their applications, however, the areas applied for were still included in a 
communal forest and was not available for fishpond purposes. It was only on 
February 27, 1953, that said areas were disestablished, and on March 16, 1953, 
certified by the Director of Fisheries as available for fishpond purposes.
<p>Acting on the three applications, the Director of Fisheries, by orders of 
April 21, 1953 and March 29, 1954, adjudicated to petitioners Sarabia and Leido, 
individually and separately, 50 hectares out of the 100-hectare area applied for 
by them. Also on March 29, 1954, the Director of Fisheries rejected the 
application of respondent Francisco B. Lardizabal for the reason that the area 
applied for by him was within that applied for by petitioner Leido who, being a 
prior applicant, was entitled to preference under Fisheries Administrative Order 
No. 14, as amended. On August 21, 1954, Ordinary Fishpond Permit No. 1938-I was 
issued to Sarabia, and on September 10, 1954, Ordinary Fishpond Permit No. 
F-2338-j was issued to Leido. Both permits bore the approval of the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources.</p>
<p>In the meantime, respondent Lardizabal, on July 29, 1954, wrote a letter to 
the President of the Philippines, through the PCAC, complaining about the 
actuations of the Director of Fisheries in regard to the disposition of the 
fishpond applications aforementioned. This letter was indorsed by the PCAC to 
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, who in turn indorsed it to 
the Director of Fisheries, who affirmed his decision granting petitioner Leido 
the preferential right over respondent Lardizabal on the ground that his 
application was filed one year ahead of Lardizabal's application. Upon being 
informed by the PCAC of the disposition made by the Director of Lands of his 
complaint, respondent Lardizabal again wrote the PCAC on October 12, 1954, 
reiterating his complaint regarding the rejection of his application by the 
Director of Fisheries, which letter was again referred to the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources, who, considering the same as an appeal from 
the decision of the Director of Lands on the matter, took action upon it and 
eventually issued an order on August 22, 1955 modifying the order of the 
Director of Lands by reducing the areas granted to petitioners Sarabia and Leido 
from 50 hectares to 33-1/3 hectares each, and giving the remaining 33-1/3 
hectares to Lardizabal. Both Sarabia and Leido moved to reconsider the order of 
the Secretary, urging, among other things, that the appeal of Lardizabal from 
the decision of the Director of Lands to the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources was filed out of time and that, therefore, the Secretary did 
not have jurisdiction to issue his amendatory order in question. The motions to 
reconsider having been denied, Sarabia and Leido filed second motions for 
reconsideration, which were also denied. Hence, Sarabia and Leido filed a 
petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case 
No. 28932) to annul said amendatory order of the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources for having been allegedly issued without or in excess of 
jurisdiction. On June 22, 1954, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the 
petition, first, because appeal and not certiorari was the proper remedy and the 
period for appeal from the order of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources had already prescribed; and second, that petitioners could have 
appealed to the President of the Philippines but did not do so, so that they had 
failed to exhaust all administrative remedies. From this judgment, Sarabia and 
Leido appealed to this Court, but we dismissed their appeal for having been 
filed out of time. "Sarabia, et al. <i>vs</i>. Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources, et al." (104 Phil., 151).</p>
<p>Later, on January 16, 1959, petitioners Sarabia and Leido filed another 
petition, this time for prohibition, in the Court of First Instance of Manila 
(Civil Case No. 38988), again claiming the nullity of the amendatory order of 
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources dated August 22, 1955 on the 
ground that it was issued after the decision of the Director of Fisheries had 
become final and after the period of respondent Lardizabal for appeal to the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources had already prescribed, and 
praying that said Secretary be forever enjoined from enforcing his decision of 
August 22, 1955. Respondent Lardizabal urged the dismissal of the petition, 
claiming that it is barred by the prior decision of this Court in G. R. No. 
L-11107, and on August 17, 1959, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing 
the petition on the grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"that the present case is <i>res adjudicata</i> and is barred by the Rules of 
Court, that the decision of the Supreme Court dismissing the appeal of the 
petitioners cannot be modified, annulled or changed by this Court for lack of 
jurisdiction, and since this action was presented for review or for the change 
of the decision of the Supreme Court, the petitioners have no cause of action 
and this Court has no jurisdiction in deciding the same."</p></blockquote>
<p>From the above judgment, petitioners took the present appeal to this 
Court.</p>
<p>We see no merit in the appeal.</p>
<p>The basic contention and cause of action of petitioners-appellants in their 
former petition for certiorari and the present petition for prohibition is the 
same: the alleged nullity of the amendatory decision of the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources dated August 22, 1955 on the ground that the 
appeal of respondent Lardizabal was filed out of time. The parties in the two 
cases are also the same, and the remedy or relief sought in both cases is 
likewise the same, the nullification of the decision of August 22, 1955 of the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the additional relief asked for 
in this proceeding for prohibition to enjoin the execution of said decision 
being merely incidental to and premised on the main prayer to annul and set 
aside the decision in question. The judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila in the former certiorari case, dismissing the petition because appeal was 
the proper remedy and because petitioners had failed to exhaust all 
administrative remedies before seeking relief in the ordinary courts, was 
tantamount to a dismissal based on petitioners' lack of a cause of action. Such 
dismissal was, therefore, a dismissal on the merits, and as petitioners' appeal 
from the judgment of the trial court to this Court was dismissed for having been 
filed out of time, said judgment became final and <i>res judicata</i> in all 
subsequent actions or suits on the same points and matters raised in said 
petition by petitioners.</p>
<p>It is of no moment that the present petition is one for prohibition while the 
former case filed by petitioners was for certiorari, since both petitions raise 
exactly the same cause of action and are based on exactly the same grounds. The 
present petition is, therefore, although presented in a different form, barred 
by the former decision in the certiorari case, since a party can not, by varying 
his form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape 
the effects of <i>res judicata</i> (Cayco <i>vs</i>. Cruz, 106 Phil., 65; 
Aguirre <i>vs</i>. Atienza, 104 Phil., 477; Labarro <i>vs</i>. Labitoria, 54 
Phil., 845; Pe√±alosa <i>vs</i>. Tuason, 22 Phil., 303, 321).</p>
<p>Appellants claim that the decision of the Court of First Instance in the 
certiorari case can not be <i>res judicata</i> in the present case because the 
petition for certiorari was dismissed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on 
the part of the court to entertain the same. This contention is fallacious and 
untenable, for the judgment of dismissal of the certiorari case was not based on 
lack of jurisdiction but, as earlier stated, on petitioners' lack of a cause of 
action to maintain a petition for certiorari to annul the decision of the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources in question, on the theory that 
the proper remedy of petitioners was appeal and not certiorari and their period 
for appeal had expired through their own negligence, and furthermore, because 
they failed to exhaust all administrative remedies. If, then, petitioners were 
not agreeable to the dismissal made by the trial court of their petition and the 
grounds therefor, their remedy was an appeal to this Court. They did appeal, but 
their appeal was dismissed by us for having been filed out of time. In view of 
the dismissal of their appeal, petitioners became concluded and bound by the 
decision of the court of first instance dismissing their certiorari case, and 
they can not now be allowed to maintain the present petition for prohibition and 
litigate and present for a second time the same issues raised and already 
disposed of in their prior petition for certiorari.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fundamental principle upon which the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> 
rests is that parties ought not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more 
than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined 
by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been 
given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be 
conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate. * *

Flores, 97 Phil., 240; 51 Off. Gaz., 3444).</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
petitioners Luis Sarabia and Jose Leido.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
