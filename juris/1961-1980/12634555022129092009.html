				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On November 30, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, doing bu­siness under the name and style of "<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit", and the <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
Bus Drivers and Conductors Union (PTGWO) entered into a three-year Collective
Bargaining Agreement<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
by virtue of which the former recognized the latter as exclusive bargaining
agent of the drivers and conductors employed by <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>,
and according to which they both agreed to abide by the schedule of the <u>hourly
regular and overtime rates of drivers and conductors</u> set forth in Annex
"B" of the Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 20, 1958, the union filed with the Court of Industrial
Relations a petition docketed as Case No. 1099-V, which it subsequently amended
on December 9, 1958, charging violation by <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> of
Commonwealth Act No. 444 (the Eight-Hour Labor Law) in that he deducted from,
and did not include in, the hours of work of the drivers and conductors the
time consumed for filling gas or for tak­ing the bus from the
"car-barn" and vice-versa, the time for trip intervals when the bus
is waiting for passen­gers, and the time consumed on minor repairs of the en­gine
and other parts of the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It therefore
prayed the court to fix the compensable hours of work of the dri­vers and
conductors, members of said union, according to the provisions of Commonwealth
Act No. 444, and to order <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> to pay the drivers
and conductors the compensable hours of work previously rendered by them from <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1956</st1:date> up to the filing of
the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Halili</span> filed his amended answer on <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Court of Industrial Relations on <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1961</st1:date> rendered a decision<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
finding <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> guilty of having violated Commonwealth
Act No. 444.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It there­upon required the
Examining Division of the Court of In­dustrial Relations to compute the
compensable hours of work rendered by the drivers and conductors who were mem­bers
of the union, from October 1, 1956<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
until the date of the decision, at the rate of P0.60 for drivers and P0.50 for
conductors per hour, and the management of <span class="SpellE">Ha­lili</span>
Transit to facilitate the examination by giving ac­cess to the Court examiner
of all trip reports, time records, time books, payrolls, vouchers, ledgers,
journals and all other pertinent records for the speedy computation of the
compensable hours of work.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 14, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> filed a
motion for clari­fication and for reception of additional evidence, where­in he
questioned the decision for not defining the compensable hours therein which
may be credited to the dri­vers and conductors, claiming that in said order the
court did not direct the Examining Division to determine the amount of
compensation actually received by the particu­lar employees on any particular
day, and contending further that the decision was not a judgment, because it
did not determine any right or duty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The Court of Industrial
Relations, on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1961</st1:date>,
issued an order wherein it clarified compensable hours as referring to work
rendered over eight hours and the computation based on the trip report per
hourly rate at P0.60 for drivers and P0.50 for conductors from <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10">Octo­ber 1, 1956</st1:date> until the date of
the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further sta­ted that the
complainants were working more than eight hours since they start from 5:30 A.M.
and stop at night, and declared that the judgment as to the liability of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> was categorically concluded in the decision but the
amount of said liability could not be determined until after the Court Examiner
renders his report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on <span class="SpellE">Halili's</span> motion for
reconsideration, the Court of Industrial Relations on April 6, 1962 entered a
resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> affirming the decision of August 7, 1961, but remanding the case to
the Court of Industrial Relations trial Judge for determination as to union mem­bership
of the claimants referred to in the decision be­cause:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The determination of who are members of
the peti­tioner union, especially that the decision would cover a period from
October 1, 1956, is a judicial determination which entails the use of
discretion and can not be left to the determination by the Court Examiner, upon
the expediency of the examination of the books, records, pay­rolls, etc."</p>

<p class="BODY">No judicial determination of the membership of the union was
however made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> appeal from the decision nor from the <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> resolution of the same dated <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on
motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="4">April
 6, 1962</st1:date> was not appealed by <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 7, 1965, the Court of Industrial relations issued an
order<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
directing the Court Examiner, assisted by a union representative, to
investigate and examine all trip reports, time records, time books, payrolls,
vou­chers, ledgers, journals, and all other pertinent records of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit, and compute the compensable hours of work
rendered by the drivers and conductors pursuant to the decision, dated August
7, 1961, for the period from January 1, 1961 up to the date of the order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> moved for a reconsideration to aforementioned
order, and on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1965</st1:date>,
filed his memorandum in support thereof - on the ground that the same is
contrary to law, the facts and evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was denied by the Court of Industrial Relations in its
resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present appeal by certiorari was thereupon ta­ken by <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> from said resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1965</st1:date> and the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner seeks to raise three issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Whether or not the trial court erred in
holding him liable for the payment under Common­wealth Act No. 444 of the
compensable hours of work ren­dered by the drivers and conductors who are
members of respondent union; (2) Whether or not the decision dated August 7,
1961 is incomplete and interlocutory and therefore the respondent court erred
in enforcing it by enter­ing its order dated April 7, 1965 and promulgating its
resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated July 12, 1965; and (3) Whether or not
the respondent court erred in directing its Exa­miner to examine and
investigate the records of petitio­ner <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> from
January 1, 1961 up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue is not properly raised because peti­tioner stated
in his notice of appeal<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
that he was appeal­ing from the order dated April 7, 1965 and the resolution <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> dated July 12, 1965, and also because the deci­sion of the Court of
Industrial Relations dated August 7, 1961 and its <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span>
resolution of August 17, 1961 already became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
the petitioner not having appealed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that the decision of the Court of Industrial
Relations dated <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1961</st1:date>
is incomplete and interlocutory in nature and therefore said court erred in
issuing its enforcing order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April
 7, 1965</st1:date> and promulgating its resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated
<st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The word <u>interlocutory</u> is defined as "something in­tervening
between commencement and the end of a suit which decides some point or matter
but is not a final decision of the whole controversy."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As stated by <span class="SpellE">Bouvier</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
it is ''something which is done between the commencement and the end of a suit
or action which decides some point or matter which however, is not a final
decision of the matter in issue."</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter in issue in the main case below (Case No. 1099-V) is
whether or not petitioner <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> is guilty of
violating the Eight-Hour Labor Law (C.A. No. 444) in that he deducted from the
working hours of the drivers and con­ductors, members of respondent union, the
time spent for taking the buses from the car-barn and filling it with gas, oil
or water; the interval for waiting for passengers; and the repair of the engine
and other parts of the bus in case of breakdown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found him guilty of the
charge and held him "<u>liable categorically</u>” for the compensable
hours and overtime pay from October 1, 1956 up to the present at the rate of
P0.60 for drivers and P0.50 for conductors per hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding of the trial court in its
decision of August 7, 1961 and affirmed in all respects <sup>_</sup> except the
"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> determination
as to the union membership of the claimants referred to in the decision x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" - by the court <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> in its resolution of April 6, 1962, is a finding of fact which is
final and conclu­sive and <u>not subject to review</u>, no appeal having been
interposed therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision, therefore, is a final adjudication on the main
issue submitted to the court, and cannot be con­sidered as interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main case is now at its execution stage
and what only remains to be threshed out is the precise compensable hours or
work rendered by, and the amount of compensation owing to, the drivers and con­ductors
who are members of the respondent union from Octo­ber 1, 1956 to date.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must state, in this connection, that petitioner cannot adopt
inconsistent stands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot assail
the decision of <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1961</st1:date>
finding him guilty of violat­ing the Eight-Hour Labor Law (C.A. No. 444) and at
the same time argue that said decision is incomplete and in­terlocutory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is petitioner's stand that since the ap­pealed order
of respondent court, sustained by the as­sailed resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
authorizes its Examiner to go over the records of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>
Transit from January 1, 1961 up to the present, the examination may
unnecessarily co­ver the records of those drivers and conductors who, al­though
members of the respondent union as of January 1, 1961, were not members thereof
as of October 1, 1956 - in violation of the decision as modified which calls
for the judicial determination of respondent union's membership.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, it was merely for the sake of convenience and
facility in the computation of compensa­ble hours of work that the respondent
court authorized its Examiner, first to go over the records of <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Tran­sit from January 1, 1961 up to the present, and
later on to examine the records from October 1, 1956 up to the end of
1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It observed that the parties were
experiencing difficulty with respect to the records from <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1956</st1:date> up to 1960, whereas those from
1961 up to the present are more readily available because the law requires busi­ness
concerns to preserve and keep intact their records for five years.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, petitioner misconstrues the im­port of the
questioned order of the trial court dated <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not seek to implement the <span class="SpellE">dispo­sitive</span> portion
of the decision dated <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1961</st1:date>
stan­ding by itself, but as modified by the resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of
<st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order merely directs the Court Examiner,
assisted by a union representative, to "compute the compensable hours of
work rendered by the drivers and conductors pursuant to the decision, dated
August 7, 1961, for the period from January 1, 1961, up to the present” and
directs the Chief of the Examining Division, "to submit a weekly report on
the examination." The order <u>does not</u> require the computation of the
compensable hours of work rendered by the drivers and conductors "<u>who
are members of the petitioner union</u>." Stated otherwise, the
determination of the union membership of the claimants - as ordered by the
resolution <u>en banc</u> dated <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="4">April
 6, 1962</st1:date> - must still be done by the trial court, <u>not</u> by the
court Examiner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is still need for
respondent union to prove before the trial court the union membership of its
claimants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, for the purpose only of facilitating the dis­position of
this case, the Court of Industrial Relations must order its Examining Division
to start with the com­putation of the compensable hours of work rendered by,
and the corresponding compensation payable to, the dri­vers and conductors
admitted by both parties to be union members as of October 1, 1956, and then
later to proceed with those contended by the union to be such members but
disputed by <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At all events, however, the resolu­tion of the issue of their union
membership must be re­solved by the trial judge himself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order and resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
are hereby affirmed and the Court of Industrial Relations is hereby enjoined to
make a judicial determination of the union membership of the claimants, while
the Examining Division of said court shall proceed with its computation of the
compensable hours of work rendered by, and the corresponding compensation
payable to, the drivers and conductors admitted by both parties to be union
members since October 1, 1956 and the contended by the union to be such members
but dispute by the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

This, instead of November 30, 1957 which was the date of the Collective
Bargaining Agreement, is the starting date of computation because in his answer
to the complaint against him by the union before the Public Service Commission
in Case No. 48603-C, <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> aver­red "that
effective last Monday, <u>October 1, 1956</u>, all drivers and conductors of
the respondent are on fixed salary basis, that is to say, conductors are paid
at the rate of P0.50 an hour, and drivers are paid at the rate of P0.60 an
hour, thereby making their wages in <span class="SpellE">confirmity</span> with
the order of this Ho­norable Commission and with Republic Act 602, known as the
Minimum Wage Law." (<span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, pp. 53-54,
