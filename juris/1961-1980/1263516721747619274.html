de <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>, peti­tioner herein and defendant in the
lower courts, from a decision of the Court of Appeals affirming that of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court hereby renders
judgment ordering the defendant within fifteen (15) days from the date this
judgment be­comes final, to execute a deed of conveyance in favor of the
plaintiff Jose <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span>, of age, Filipino, married to <span class="SpellE">Querubina</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, over lot 30;
block 84 of the <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>-can Subdivision, covered by TCT
59442 of the Manila Registry, with his postal address at 544 Corner <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Blvd., Manila, and directing said defendant to
deliver the certificate of title, and ordering the plaintiff to de­liver to the
defendant at the time of receiving the afore­said deed of sale and title, the
amount of P12,000 in cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs <span class="GramE">is</span> charged against the defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 4, 1947, said petitioner - hereinafter referred to as
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> - and respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span>
- hereinafter referred to as the lessee - entered into a lease contract whereby
the former leased to the latter a parcel of land known as Lot 30 of block 84 of
the <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>-can Subdivision, located at <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila, with an area of about 150 square meters,
and more particularly described in TCT No. 59442 of the office of the Register
of Deeds of Manila. In their written con­tract of lease it was stipulated, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the term thereof would be ten (10)
years, from November 1, 1947 to November 1, 1957; that the monthly rental would
be P250, payable in advance; that the lessee could demolish the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> old building on the leased premises and construct
thereon any building and/or improvements suitable for school purposes, which
new building and/or improvements shall be­long to the lessee; that within one
(1) year after the expiration of the lease, the lessee would have "the
right and option to buy the leased premises" for P12, 000; that, should
the lessee fail to exercise this option, said(new) building and/or improvements
shall be evaluated by a committee organized <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
as set forth in the contract; that, after such "valuation", the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> shall -"have the option to buy" said
"building and/or improvements within x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> one (1) year, after the ex­piration of the
contract";' and that, should neither of the parties exer­cise their
respective options, both "shall be free to look for a buyer for his or her
respective property."</p>

<p class="BODY">By a letter, dated September 15, 1958, the lessee informed the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> that the former (lessee) was exercising "his
right to buy the leased property for the agreed price of P12, 000, " and
inquired "when" the latter (<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>) would
be "ready to execute the deed of sale," so that the agreed price
could be delivered to her. Soon thereafter, before the expiration of the term
of his option, or on October 6, 1958, the lessee wrote a follow-up letter to
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, advising her that the former had in his
"possession the amount of P12, 000 with which to pur­chase" the
leased premises, and, asked her, once more, "when" she would be ready
to execute the corresponding deed of sale, in order that he (lessee) could pay
said price. Through her counsel, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> replied,
however, on <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1958</st1:date>,
that she "cannot accede" to the lessee's requests "because the x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> contract of <st1:date year="1947" day="4" month="10">October
 4, 1947</st1:date>, has been <span class="SpellE">novated</span> by another
agreement, wherein the rent of P250 a month was reduced to P100.00."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, that same month, the lessee instituted the present
action to compel the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to comply with her
obligation to execute the corresponding deed of sale in his (lessee's) favor,
upon payment by him of said sum of P12, 000. The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
filed her answer admitting some allegations of the complaint and denying other
allegations thereof, as well as alleging, as special defense, that the lease
contract had been "modified" by a subsequent agreement of the
parties, which had been observed and carried out by them, and that payment of
the stipu­lated price had not been properly tendered or validly consigned. The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, likewise, set up a counterclaim for damages,
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance rendered the
decision adverted to above, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Hence,
this petition for review on certiorari, in which the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
maintains: (1) that the lessee's option to purchase the leased premises was
null and void for want of consi­deration; (2) that the lessee should have been
sentenced to pay rentals, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
case; and (3) that the lessee should have been sentenced, also, to pay damages,
attorney's fees and the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first contention is clearly without merit. To begin with, it
is based upon the premise that the option of the lessee is devoid of
consideration, which is false. Indeed, in reciprocal contracts, like the one in
question, the obligation or promise of each party is the consideration for that
of the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In the language of Article 1350 of our Civil Code, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)
n onerous contracts the cause is understood to be, for each contracting party,
the <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> or promise of a thing or service by
the other x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." As a
consequence, "(t) he power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal
ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon
him<span class="GramE">.“</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the consideration for the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span>
obligation to sell the leased premises to the lessee, should he choose to
exercise his option to purchase the same, is the obligation of the lessee to
sell to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> the building and/or improvements
constructed and/or made by the former, if he fails to exercise his option to
buy said pre­mises. Then, again, the amount of the rentals agreed upon in the
contract of October 4, 1947 - which amount turned out to be so bur­densome upon
the lessee, that the <span class="SpellE">l<span style="">e</span>ssor</span>
agreed, five (5) years later, to reduce it - as well as the building and/or
improvements contemplated to be constructed and/or introduced by the lessee,
were, undoubtedly, part of the consideration for his option to purchase the
leased premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, the alleged lack of consideration <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> was not set up as a defense or otherwise put in
issue, either in the trial court or in the Court of Appeals. The appealed
decisions of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals, and the
records before us show that the defenses mainly pressed in said courts were the
alleged cancellation of the lessee's option and his failure to make a valid ten­der
and consignation of the stipulated price. The cancellation of the option was
sought to be deduced from a <span class="SpellE">novation</span> made in 1952,
when, upon the lessee's request, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> agreed to
reduce the monthly rental from P250 to P100. <span class="GramE">Neither defense
was, however, sustained by said courts, and</span>, we think, correctly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, not being inconsistent with the lessee's option to pur­chase
the leased premises, said agreement to reduce the rental did not necessarily
cancel or <span class="GramE">extinguish</span> the option. Although the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> would have the Court believe that she consented to
said reduction, on condition that the option <span class="GramE">be</span>
cancelled, this claim had <u>not</u> been proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, it was refuted by her letter to
the lessee, Exhibit D, dated January 29, 1952, stating that "in view of
the fact that you (lessee) find it very difficult to pay the rental of P250, I
am willing to reduce it to P100 from January 1952, <u>on the condition that the
remaining balance (of the rental) will be settled</u>." The cancellation
of the option was not, therefore, one of the conditions for the aforementioned
reduction of the rental.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, the consignation referred to in Article 1256 of our
Civil Code is inapplicable to the present case, because said provision refers
to consignation as one of the means for the payment or discharge of a
"debt", whereas the lessee was not indebted to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> for the price of the leased premises.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
The lessee merely exercised a <u>right</u> of option and had <u>no</u>
obligation to pay said price until the execution of the deed of sale in his
favor, which the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> refused to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said want of consideration not having pleaded or otherwise alleged
as one of her defenses in either one of the lower courts, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> may not set it up, for the first time, in her
present second appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the rentals during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case, suffice it to note that, had the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
readily complied with her obligation to execute the corresponding deed of
conveyance to the lessee, upon pay­ment by him of the agreed price of P12, 000,
which he tendered in October, 1958, the premises in question would have become
his pro­perty on or before November 1, 1958, and since then he would have had
no obligation to pay rentals. As a consequence, it is neither just nor fair to
impose such obligation upon him by reason of the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span>
illegal breach of their contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, she would be rewarded <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and we
would jeopardize the sanctity of contractual obligations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last point raised by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is
a mere corollary to those already disposed of. Hence, it needs no further
discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby affirmed, with costs against the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>;
petitioner-appellant Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span>
