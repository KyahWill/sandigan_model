and documentary, and the exhaustive Memorandum of the Defense, finds accused
FLORENCIO ORDIALES guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder,
punishable under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, committed with the
aggravating and the mitigating circumstances above mentioned, and hereby
sentences him to suffer the penalty of <span style="">death

and to pay the costs."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Amended Information charged accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordiales</span> of the crime
of murder committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 4th day of November, 1968, in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the <span class="SpellE">abovenamed</span> accused, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordiales</span> y <span class="SpellE">Abaro</span>, <u>being then a Confidential Agent of the City
Mayor, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, duly appointed and qualified as
such taking advantage of his public position with deliberate intent to kill,
and with</u> evident premeditation, and treachery <u>aforethought, suddenly and
unexpectedly,</u> did then and there <span class="SpellE">wil­fully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously <u>attack, assault and</u> shoot for several times <u>on
the vital parts of the body, unarmed</u> Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>,
with a carbine the herein accused was <u>then</u> provided <u>with, which
treacherous acts tended to directly and specially insure its</u> execution,
without risk to himself, <u>from the defense that Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>
may make,</u> thereby inflicting upon the latter several mortal wounds, which
caused his instantaneous death.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>That at the time of the commission of this offense the accused-<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordiales</span> y <span class="SpellE">Abaro</span> was provided with a motor vehicle, which he took
advantage of, to facilitate his escape from the scene of the crime.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>All contrary to law, with the qualifying <u>circums­tance</u> of <span class="SpellE">alevosia</span>, <u>and the aggravating circumstances</u> of (1) <u>his
public position, (2) evident premeditation, and (3) the use of a motor vehicle</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that on 4 November 1968,
at 5:30 in the afternoon, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, with two
companions, Daniel Brown, Jr., and Rolando Cruz, were at the <span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span> room of <span class="SpellE">Nad's</span>
restaurant, <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were starting to drink <span class="SpellE">pepsi</span>-cola and gin, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ordiales</span> entered, asking Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>,
"<u>Sino <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">ang</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">minumura</span> mo</u>?" immediately
firing at the latter a U. S. carbine, caliber .30, in rapid succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was unable to answer because he
was hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellant then put down
his firearm to look at <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, after which he left
the restaurant and boarded a yellow jeep parked outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two other persons were in the said jeep by
the names of <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magsakay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Daniel Brown, Jr., ran away after the first shot, while the
victim's other companion, Rolando Cruz, was literally frozen with fear in his
seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>
died of multiple gunshot wounds at 6:10 that same afternoon upon arrival at San
Juan de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Hospital, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The assailant shot him at a distance of two and a half (2 1/2) yards, more or
less.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The slaying is admitted by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense's own version of the incident was that
accused-appellant saw Lt. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Hernandez at the
lobby of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Hall in the morning of 4
November 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former asked the
latter <span style="">if he could have his carbine M-1
converted to an automatic one or M-2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the accused-appellant did not have the carbine with him at the
time, they agreed to meet at <span class="SpellE">Nad's</span> restaurant at 5:30
that afternoon so he could deliver the carbine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At past five of the said afternoon, accused-appellant went to the
<span class="SpellE">Nad's</span> restaurant to keep the appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While accused-appellant was looking for a
place to sit in the <span class="SpellE">airconditioned</span> room, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> whistled at him, motioning him to come near.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as accused-appellant approached <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>, the latter said, "Tell the mayor that next
year he will lose." Accused-appellant answered, "<span class="SpellE"><u>Huwag</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">naman</span> <span class="SpellE">ganon</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Bakit</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">hindi</span> kayo <span class="SpellE">magkasundo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dati</span> kayo <span class="SpellE">magkasama</span>.</u>" Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>,
however, shouted, "<span class="SpellE"><u>Basta</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">sabihin</span> mo <span class="SpellE">talo</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">siya</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">isang</span> <span class="SpellE">taon</span></u>!"
Accused-appellant shouted back, saying, "Why don't you tell him?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are sending me to tell him!"</p>

<p class="BODY">Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> suddenly stood up with
hands on waist and was able to approach accused-appellant, holding the barrel
of the latter's carbine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim's
two companions also rushed at accused-appellant, whereupon, the latter stepped
backward and fired at <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said companions ran away after <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> was fired upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant left the restaurant after <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>
fell and took a taxi at Taft Avenue near <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
Commercial Center with the intention of surrendering to the mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the corner of <span class="SpellE">Malibay</span>,
accused-appellant met Francisco Villa (who was going to be appointed Chief of
Police of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City later), so he stopped and told
him that he shot somebody <span style="">and that he
was going to surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Villa, however,
advised him to surrender instead to the NBI.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused-appellant, accompanied by Mr. Villa, then proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Bankal</span> to see NBI agent </span><span style="">Mr. </span><span style="">Aragon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Aragon, who arrived in his house later
was told what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, in turn,
accom­panied accused-appellant, to the NBI where the latter surrendered to one
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> with the carbine used in the shooting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a quo</u> found the aggravating circumstances of (a)
abuse of official position, (b) evident premeditation, and (c) use of superior
force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it considered the use of
superior force as absorbed by the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said court also found the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender, offsetting one of the two remaining
aggravating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
death penalty was imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of
motor vehicle which was likewise alleged in the Amended Information was not
appreciated by the court <u>a quo</u> for the reason that the jeep was not used
as a means to commit the murder.</p>

brief:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred <span style="">in -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing on record to warrant a reversal of the court <u>a
quo's</u> finding that treachery attended the killing of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sudden and unexpected shooting of the
victim with a carbine constituted treachery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Authorities are clear that even when in attack or aggression is made
face to face, treachery or <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span> is
nevertheless present when the attack is sudden and unexpected to the point of
incapacitating the victim to repel <span style="">or
escape it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Accused-appellant's account as </span>to <span style="">what precipitated the shooting could not be
believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sta</span>t<span style="">ement, "Tell the mayor that next year he
will lose," or "<span class="SpellE"><u>Basta</u></span><u> </u></span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">sabihin</span></u></span><u><span style=""> mo <span class="SpellE">talo</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">isang</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">taon</span></u>", could <span style="">not be </span>attributed to <span style="">the
deceased, </span>who, being an avid <span class="SpellE">compaigner</span> of
local mayoralty <span style="">candidates, at least </span>from
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Cuneta's</span> time up to the election <span style="">of </span>Mayor <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>
Claudio, certainly could not have ignored that 1969 was not a mayoralty
election year, On the other hand, it is admitted by the prosecution that the
deceased and his twin brother, Reynaldo, had repeatedly slandered the incumbent
mayor, since the latter disregarded the promise to make Reynaldo the chief of
his confidential agents stating that the promise was merely a joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, on the afternoon before the shooting
and when the brothers met at Shanghai restaurant, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, the victim told Reynaldo that he slandered the mayor again because the
mayor refused to sign something which the victim asked him to sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The version of the prosecution that it was
accused-appellant who first confronted the victim with, <u>"Sino <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">minumura</span>
mo?</u>" becomes more believable in the light of what happened, and
especially since it is not dis­puted that accused-appellant was present at
least in one of those occasions when the mayor was slandered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defense witness <span class="SpellE">Pedrito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caballes</span> impliedly so admitted by quoting Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> as saying to accused-appellant before he was shot,
"<span class="SpellE"><u>huwag</u></span><u> mo <span class="SpellE">akong</span>
<span class="SpellE">pakialaman</span></u>." Finally, prosecution witnesses
Daniel Brown, Jr., and Rolando Cruz corroborated each other in quoting
accused-appellant as having said, "<u>Sino <span class="SpellE">ba</span>
and <span class="SpellE">minumura</span> mo</u>?" as against the lone denial
of accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the deceased had two companions while
accused-appellant was alone, but superiority in number does not necessarily
mean superiority in strength.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
These three men were all seated and unarmed, and their movement was impeded by
the table at which they sat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
positions even gave accused-appellant more advantage especially since he
carried two firearms, a carbine and a revolver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, as correctly held by the lower court, abuse of superior
strength is absorbed in treachery and is inherent in the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is accused-appellant's contention, and error was assigned in
this regard, that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses should not be
given full credence because of alleged serious and material contradictions,
inconsistencies and manifestly false assertions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our review of the evidence demonstrates that
the contradictions were not on material points.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule is settled in this jurisdiction that appellate courts seldom
disturb a trial court's appreciation of the credibility of witnesses, in view
of its opportunity to observe the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses while
testifying on the witness stand; and that said appreciation of the court below
will generally be accepted and acted upon favorably by the appellate courts,
unless there is a material circumstance which consequently might affect the
result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As already noted earlier, the exception does not obtain in this case, hence,
the finding of treachery is sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">We come next to the question of whether the aggravating
circumstances of abuse of public position and evident premeditation really
attended the commission of the crime as found by the court <u>a quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For abuse of public position under Article
14, paragraph 1, Revised Penal Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to be appreciated, it is not only necessary that the person committing the crime
be a public official; he must also use the influence, prestige or <span class="SpellE">ascendency</span> which such office gives him as a means by which
he realized his purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essence of
the matter is presented in the inquiry, "Did the accused abuse his office
in order to commit the crime?"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not shown that accused-appellant took advantage of his position as
confidential agent of Mayor Claudio in shooting the victim, or that he used his
influence, prestige or <span class="SpellE">ascendency</span>" in killing
the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellant could
have shot <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> without having occupied the said
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the absence of proof
that advantage was taken by accused-appellant of his being a confidential
agent, the aggravating circumstance of abuse of public position could not be
properly appreciated against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The So­licitor
General also concedes this.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The court <u>a quo's</u> finding that the said aggravating circumstance is
present can not, therefore, be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation has not likewise
been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mere fact that accused-appellant killed <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span> does
not necessarily prove in itself that the former hatched a plan to kill the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was no direct evidence
of the planning or preparation, the court's conclusion may not be endorsed,
since it is not enough that premeditation be suspected or surmised, but the
criminal intent must be evidenced by notorious outward acts evincing the
determination to commit the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Much less is there a showing of opportunity for reflection and the per­sistence
in the criminal intent that characterize the aggravating circumstance of
evident premeditation.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The court <u>a quo</u> therefore erred in appreciating the said aggravating
circumstance against accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General likewise concedes this finding.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the plea of self-defense under Article 11, paragraph
1, of the Revised Penal Code, the rule is that the same must be proved by clear
and convincing <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The three concurring requisites should be present, namely, (a) unlawful aggres­sion
on the part of the victim; (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to
repel the aggression; and (c) lack of sufficient pro­vocation on the part of
the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find no proof of unlawful aggression on the part of the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was seated and unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court finds it hard to believe that he
suddenly stood up with hands at his waist, which allegedly led accused-appellant
to think that the former would draw a gun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The victim, fully aware that he was not armed, and knowing that his
adversary carried a carbine, would not bluff at so great a risk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find it still harder to believe that the
victim arose and approached or rushed at accused-appellant, and suddenly held
the barrel of the latter's carbine without first being shot at, for the reasons
that (a) a table obstructed his way;<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
(b) accused-appellant was at least 2 1/2 yards away from the victim,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
which distance could not have been easily and quickly traversed from where the
alleged aggressor was seated, considering the obstruction; and (c) according to
his own version, accused-appellant already warned that he would shoot if the
victim approached him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have
been foolhardy and suicidal for the victim to act in the manner that accused-appellant
would like this Court to believe, knowing that the accused-appellant was poised
to shoot if the victim should make a move to approach him, and this holds
likewise of the victim's companions, who were not themselves armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, accused-appellant would like Us to
believe that he shot the victim only after the latter held the barrel of the
gun and only after he had first stepped backward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement of Daniel Brown, Jr.,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
that the victim fell from his seat to the cement floor like "a burning candle",
belies further the claim of accused-appellant that the deceased was shot only
after he approached accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, accused-appellant's plea of self-defense can
not be sustained, since he was himself the ag­gressor.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that the guilt of accused-appellant has been
proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the death penalty should be reduced in the absence of the aggravating
circumstances of abuse of public position and evident preme­ditation which were
erroneously found by the court <u>a quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
the penalty for murder is <u>reclusion temporal</u> in its maximum period to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being only one mitigating
circumstance, that of voluntary surrender, and no aggravating circumstance to
offset the same, the imposable penalty is the minimum pur­suant to Article 64,
paragraph 2, of the same Code, which is the maximum period of <u>reclusion
temporal</u> under Article 248, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act 4103, as amended by Act 4225)
applies in view of the nature of the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under this law, the judgment sentencing the accused to a prison term
provides for a <u>minimum</u> within the range of the penalty next lower in
degree to be fixed in any of its periods in the dis­cretion of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Under Article 61, paragraph 3, of the Revised Penal Code when the penalty
prescribed for the crime is composed of one or two indivisible penalties and
the maximum period of another divisible penalty, as in this case, the penalty
next lower in degree shall be composed of the medium and minimum periods of the
proper divisible penalty and the maximum of that immediately following in said
