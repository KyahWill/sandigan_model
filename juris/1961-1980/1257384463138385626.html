				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An appeal &nbsp;from two Orders &nbsp;of the Court &nbsp;of First Instance of Manila, dated January 23, 1961, dismissing &nbsp;plaintiff's complaint &nbsp;on the ground of &nbsp;prescription of action, and March 4, 1961, denying motion for reconsideration of the first order. <p>On &nbsp;December &nbsp;21, &nbsp;1949, the &nbsp;CFI &nbsp;of Manila rendered judgment &nbsp;in &nbsp;Civil &nbsp;Case No. 9694, in favor of herein &nbsp;plaintiff-appellant and against defendants- appellees, for the payment of various &nbsp;sums of &nbsp;money representing &nbsp;loans. &nbsp;As the five (5) year period within which to enforce judgment by &nbsp;mere &nbsp;motion, &nbsp;had already elapsed, plaintiff, &nbsp;on October 8, I960, filed a complaint &nbsp;for revival of the aforesaid judgment. &nbsp;Defendants, instead of answering the complaint, presented on &nbsp;January 10,1961, a Petition to Dismiss, &nbsp;claiming that the &nbsp;action is now barred by the statute of limitations. &nbsp;Plaintiff &nbsp;opposed said motion, arguing &nbsp;that although &nbsp;ten &nbsp;(10) &nbsp;years and &nbsp;nine &nbsp;(9) months had elapsed since the aforesaid judgment was rendered, when the instant complaint for revival &nbsp;was presented, its &nbsp;action had not as then prescribed, because the prescriptive period had been legally interrupted when plaintiff sent two (2) extrajudicial &nbsp; written demands to the defendants on March 29, 1954 and September &nbsp;5, 1954, for the payment or satisfaction of the judgment. &nbsp;A reply to the above opposition was filed by &nbsp;defendants. &nbsp;On &nbsp;January 23, 1961, the trial court issued an &nbsp;Order, to wit—</p> <blockquote> <p>"After &nbsp;considering the &nbsp;'Petition to Dismiss' filed by counsel for the &nbsp;defendants, the opposition &nbsp;thereto by counsel for the plaintiff dated &nbsp;January &nbsp;19, 1961 and the reply to the plaintiff's opposition filed with this Court &nbsp;on January 21, 1961, for reasons stated in said &nbsp;petition to dismiss and the reply to the plaintiff's opposition, the &nbsp;Court &nbsp;orders &nbsp;the dismissal of &nbsp;this complaint, with costs against the plaintiff, because the action has already prescribed." </p> </blockquote> <p>Plaintiff moved to &nbsp;reconsider the above order, in a motion dated February 21, 1961, wherein it elaborated on the grounds contained in its opposition to the Petition to Dismiss. &nbsp;It supported its&nbsp; motion &nbsp;for reconsideration with the cases &nbsp;of &nbsp;Marella, et al. vs. Agoncillo, 44 &nbsp;Phil. &nbsp;844; Compana General de Tabacos <em>vs.</em> Martinez, et al., 29 Phil. 515; and Aldeguer vs. Gemerio, et al., 68 Phil., 421. &nbsp;The opposition to &nbsp;the &nbsp;motion pointed out that the doctrines enunciated &nbsp;in the cited &nbsp;cases, &nbsp;are not &nbsp;applicable to &nbsp;the one &nbsp;under &nbsp;consideration. &nbsp;On March 4, &nbsp;1961, the trial court denied &nbsp;the motion for reconsideration. It would seem that the only issue involved in the present appeal &nbsp;is &nbsp;whether &nbsp;or not &nbsp;the sending &nbsp;of extra-judicial written demands, asking the satisfaction of the judgment, suspended &nbsp;the &nbsp;period within &nbsp;which to bring &nbsp;an &nbsp;action upon said judgment.</p> <p>It fs alleged that the &nbsp;pertinent provisions &nbsp;of the law that governs &nbsp;the case are the following—</p> <blockquote> <p>"Article 1144. &nbsp;The following actions must be brought within ten years from the time the right of actions accrues:</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; *»</p> <p>(3) Upon a judgment."</p> <p>"Article 1152. &nbsp;The period of prescription of actions to demand fulfillment &nbsp;of obligations declared by a judgment &nbsp;commences from the time the judgment &nbsp;become final."</p> <p>"ARTICLE 1155. &nbsp;<em>The prescription of actions.</em>—The &nbsp;prescription of actions are interrupted when they are filed before the court, when there is a written extra-judicial demand by the creditors, and when there is any written &nbsp;acknowledgment of the debt &nbsp;by &nbsp;the debtor." (Civil Code).</p> </blockquote> <p>The trial court held that the ten &nbsp;(10) &nbsp;year period was not &nbsp;suspended: with &nbsp;the sending of the written &nbsp;extrajudicial demands; &nbsp;that the provision &nbsp;which &nbsp;states that prescription of actions &nbsp;are &nbsp;interrupted when there is a written extra-judicial demand, refers to an action &nbsp;which has not been passed upon in a Judgment, but not an &nbsp;action to enforce &nbsp;a judgment; that Article 1144 &nbsp;provides that action upon a judgment must be brought within ten (10) years from the time the right of action accrues, which is "from the time the judgment becomes final" (Art. 1152); that if written extra-judicial demands interrupts an &nbsp; action upon the &nbsp;prescriptive period on a final judgment, &nbsp;the case will never be terminated; that the provisions &nbsp;of the civil code, did not contemplate &nbsp;such a predicament; and considering further that a judgment is ordinarily enforced by a writ &nbsp;of execution, &nbsp;as provided for in Sec. &nbsp;6, Rule &nbsp;39, and not by &nbsp;an extra-judicial demand as contemplated &nbsp;in Art. 1159, <em>supra</em>, it stands to reason that the said &nbsp; extrajudicial demands, &nbsp;refer to &nbsp;those made &nbsp;by the creditors before &nbsp;an &nbsp; action &nbsp;is &nbsp;filed &nbsp;and not &nbsp;in cases where final judgments &nbsp;have already been &nbsp;secured, as in the present case, and that for one thing, appellant &nbsp;Bank is guilty &nbsp;of laches, &nbsp;in not &nbsp;executing the &nbsp;judgment in &nbsp;its favor &nbsp;for number of years.</p> <p>We are of the opinion, however, that article 1155, &nbsp;N.C.C heretofore &nbsp;quoted, is not applicable to the instant case.<br> The judgment &nbsp;in question became final on &nbsp;December 21, 1949, &nbsp;from which date prescription began to run., &nbsp;The new Civil Code took effect &nbsp; August &nbsp;30, &nbsp;1950, &nbsp;and &nbsp;article 1116 thereof &nbsp;states—</p> <blockquote> <p>"Art. 1116. &nbsp;Prescription already running before the &nbsp;effectivity of this Code shall be governed &nbsp;by laws &nbsp;previously in force; but if since the time this Code took &nbsp;effect &nbsp;the entire period &nbsp;herein required for prescription should &nbsp;elapse, the present Code shall be applicable even though by the former laws a &nbsp;longer period might be required."</p> </blockquote> <p>The law &nbsp;applicable, &nbsp;therefore, &nbsp;in &nbsp;determining &nbsp;whether prescription has been &nbsp;interrupted in the case at bar, is Act No. 190, &nbsp;which provides as follows—</p> <blockquote> <p>"Sec. &nbsp;50. &nbsp;<em>What shall &nbsp;renew &nbsp;right of &nbsp;action</em>—When &nbsp;payment has been made upon any demand &nbsp;founded upon contract, &nbsp;or &nbsp;a written acknowledgment thereof or a promise to pay &nbsp;the same has been made and &nbsp;signed by the party sought to be charged, an action may be brought thereon within the time herein limited, after such payment, acknowledgment, or promise."</p> </blockquote> <p>As will be seen, Section 50, gives as &nbsp;grounds for suspending the running of the period of prescription when &nbsp;payment has been made upon any demand founded upon contract or a written acknowledgment &nbsp;thereof or a promise to pay the same has been made and signed by the party sought to &nbsp;be &nbsp;charged. &nbsp;&nbsp;It did not include &nbsp;written &nbsp;extrajudicial demand made by the creditor, mentioned in Article 1155, &nbsp;New Civil &nbsp;Code, &nbsp;above quoted. &nbsp;This being true, the extra-judicial demands effected in the instant case, did not suspend the running of the period and the present action has already prescribed.</p> <p>On &nbsp;the &nbsp;ground &nbsp;herein set forth, &nbsp;the &nbsp;orders appealed from, &nbsp;are hereby affirmed, &nbsp;with costs &nbsp;against &nbsp;appellant Bank, in both instances.</p> <p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, &nbsp;Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala</em> and<em> Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
