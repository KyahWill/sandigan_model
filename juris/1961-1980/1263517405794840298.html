<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1967</st1:date>,
the Commissioner of Public Highways directed the Division Engineer of the
Second Engineering Division, of which <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> is a
part, to supervise the implementation of section 5 of said Department Order No.
145 and "see to it that the personnel are equitably distributed to the
three engineering districts." Six (6) days later, Oscar Data, as Highway
District Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, informed the
employees concerned of said Department Order No. 145 and of the aforementioned
communication of the Commissioner of Public Highways and bade them to be ready
for a possible "transfer to two other engineering districts."</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, or on July 19, 1967, the Officer-in-Charge of
the Department of Public Works asked the Budget Commissioner to authorize the
release of funds for salaries of the district engineers to be assigned to the
newly created engineering districts in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
said funds "to be taken from the balance of the 3% Administrative Portion
of the Excess Income of the Highway Special Fund, R.A. 917, as amended, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Presently, or on July 24, 1967, the municipal mayors of <span class="SpellE">Calasiao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mangaldan</span>, San Jacinto
and <span class="SpellE">Binmaley</span>, as well as the vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Mangatarem</span> and a former vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Urbiz­tondo</span>,
all of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, filed, with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, Civil Case No.
<span class="GramE">D-2059 thereof, against respondents herein, for a declaration
of nullity of said Department Order No. 145, and a writ of preliminary
injunction and/or restraining order.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The restraining order was, on the same date, issued by Honorable Jose S.
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, as Judge of said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A week later, on <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1967</st1:date>, the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
commenced the present action, directly in the Sup­reme Court, for the purpose
stated at the beginning of this decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the Department Order No. 145 is assailed by
petitioner herein mainly upon the ground that, in issuing said order,
respondent Secretary had acted without or in excess of jurisdiction; that the
power to divide the Philippines into Engineering Districts is vested, by
Section 1909 of the Revised Admi­nistrative Code, in the Director of Public
Works, not in said re­spondent Secretary; that the three (3) engineering
districts sought to be established by the contested Order would entail
"the expen­diture or disbursement of funds not legally, and specifically
appro­priated" <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, as well as have
"the effect of arbitrarily and illegally imposing additional burden on the
petitioner"; and that "the creation of additional districts in any
province is only possible through the enactment of the appropriate law."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Petitioner' s</span> contention is untenable.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the power
to create engineering districts is vested, by Section 1909 of the Revised
Administrative Code, in the Director of Public Works with the approval of the
Department Head, the Secretary of Public Works and Communications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span class="GramE">is,</span> also, true,
however, that, pursuant to Section 79(C) of the same Code:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 79 (C).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Power of direction and
supervision</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Department
Head shall have direct control, direction, and supervision over all bureaus and
offices under his jurisdiction and may, any pro­vision of existing law to the
contrary notwithstanding, repeal or modify the decisions of the chief of said
bureaus or offices when advisable in the public interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x.”</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The general power of control thus vested in department heads is
reiterated in section 550 of said Code, which provides that "(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> Director or other chief official of each Bureau or Of­fice"
shall perform his duties "<u>under the immediate executive</u> control,
direction, and supervision of the proper Department Head x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>." Then, again, it is well-settled that said
power of control of department heads includes the authority to "modify,
nullify or set aside" the acts of their subordinate officials, and to
substitute the judgment or discretion of the former for that of the latter, as
well as the right to act in lieu of the aforemen­tioned subordinate officials.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span></span></a>
Indeed, Section 37 of Act No. 4007 explicitly ordains that:</p>

<blockquote>"The provisions of the existing law to the contrary
notwithstanding, whenever a specific power, authority, duty, function, or
activity is entrusted to a chief of bureau, office, division or service, the
same shall be understood as also conferred upon the proper Department Head who
shall have authority to act directly in pursuance thereof, or to review, modify
or revoke any decision or action of said chief of bureau, office, division or
service."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span>, pursuant to
the second paragraph of Section 79 (D) of the Revised Administrative Code:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 79 (D).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Department Head also may, from time to time, in the
interest of the service, change the distribution among the several Bureaus and
offices of his Department of the employees or subordinates authorized by
law."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's objection to
the effect that the contested order would entail "the expenditure of or
disbursement of funds not legally and specifically appropriated" <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is devoid of factual and legal foundation,
inasmuch as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) section 5 of said order
provides that "the present personnel, including furniture and equipment of
the present District Engineer's Office, shall be <u>divided</u> between the
three engineering districts"; and (b) such additional expenditure, as may
be necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, shall be taken "from the
balance of the 3% of the Administrative Portion of the Excess Income of the
Highway Special Fund" provided for in Republic Act No. 917.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3 of Republic Act No. 2264,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span></span></a>
upon which petitioner relies, refers to "public works projects financed by
the <u>provincial</u>, <u>city</u> and <u>municipal</u> funds or any other fund
borrowed from or advanced by private third parties," and has no
application to the management and operation of engineer­ing districts which are
concerned with <u>national</u> roads and highways.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that petitioner
will have to provide for two additional quarters for the new engineering
districts does not de­tract from the <u>authority</u> of respondent Secretary
to create engineer­ing district, which, at any rate, <u>petitioner recognizes</u>
in the Director of Public Works, although the latter's authority, in con­nection
with public highways, has been transferred, since the creation of the Bureau of
Public Highways<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[2]</span></span></a>
to the Commissioner of Public Highways.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is urged that,
although an engineering district may include more than one province, a province
may not constitute more than one engineering district, pursuant to sections
1909, 1911 and 1915 of the Revised Administrative Code, reading:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 1909.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Engineering districts</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- With the approval of the Department Head,
the Director of Public Works shall divide the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
into such number of engineering districts as shall from time to time be deemed
advisable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The several engineering
districts shall, as far as practicable, be coextensive with the territorial
limits of the re­spective provinces."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 1911.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Functions of district engineer</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The district engineer shall have general
supervision over the construction, maintenance, and repair of provincial public
works of the district to which he is assigned and over all contracts connected
with such works.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon request of any provincial board in his district, the
district engineer shall make investiga­tions and surveys of proposed
construction or re­pair of public works, and shall submit to said pro­vincial
board reports and estimates of the cost of construction or repair of such
proposed works with his recommendations, and he shall, subject to the
regulations of the Bureau of Public Works, prepare plans and specifications for
such public works as may be required by the provincial board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It shall be the duty of the district engineer to prepare a
comprehensive scheme of roads for all of the provinces and municipalities in
his district, which shall be submitted, with his recommendations, to the
provincial and municipal governments interest­ed."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 1915.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Special assignment of
engineer to superintend provincial construction work</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Upon the request of the provincial board of
any province to which a district engineer is not assigned, the Direc­tor of
Public Works shall, with the approval of the Department Head, assign from the
engineering force under his control an engineer to prepare plans and estimates
for engineering work desired by such provincial board, or to supervise the
construction of engineering work which has been duly authorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of such assignment the provisions of
the next preceding section with regard to payment of the expense of such
service shall apply to the interested province, municipality or municipal
district."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sections 1911 and 1915 refer to <u>provincial</u> public or cons­truction
works, not to <u>national</u> highways which are within the juris­diction of
highway engineering districts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
other hand, not­hing contained in Section 19 09 negates the power to create
several engineering districts within a province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, several engineering districts
have, in fact, been established by Department Orders of respondent Secretary in
various provinces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and this is the first time his authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has
been contested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the approval of a
number of acts of Congress establishing more than one engineering district in
given provinces indicates precisely that the general legislative policy is <u>not</u>
against splitting a province into several engineering districts, although,
presumably, especial congressional action may have been deemed convenient in
specific cases, when the purpose sought could not be attained through
administrative action of the executive branch, owing to the latter's
unwillingness or reluctance to do so.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner brands the
contested order as impractical, not productive of any material benefit and a
political gimmick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say
that these objections tend to impugn the wisdom of the measure, which is beyond
our province to pass upon, and on which We cannot, consistently with the principle
of separation of powers, encroach, the exercise of judicial power, in relation
thereto, being limited to an inquiry into the authority to issue said order,
and which We find to be within the competence of respondent Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it appears that the first
engineering district comprises the first congressional district, consisting of
14 muni­cipalities; the second engineering district, the second and third
congressional districts, composed altogether of 12 municipalities; and the
third engineering district, the fourth and fifth congressional districts, with
19 municipalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> is a big province, with a total of 45
municipalities, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot say that the aforementioned
division thereof into three engineering dis­tricts constitutes a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition in this case should be, as it is
hereby dismissed, and the restraining order issued by this Court set aside,
