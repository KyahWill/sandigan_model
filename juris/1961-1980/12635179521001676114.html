COURT OF APPEALS AND RALS CONSTRUCTION, INC., RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Luzon Stevedoring Corporation would assail a resolution
of respondent Court of Appeals of April 12, 1967 denying its motion to dismiss
an appeal of respondent <span class="SpellE">Rals</span> Construction, Inc. on
the ground that the record on appeal, on its face, failed to show that it was
perfected within the period fixed by the Rules of Court as well as its
resolution of May 31, 1967 denying its motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was ample justification then for this
special civil action for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
pointed out in such motion and reiterated in its motion for reconsideration,
this Court had, without exception, considered as fatally defective appeals
vitiated by a failure to comply with that specific command of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court was thus called
upon to respect, certainly not to disregard, what this Court had time and time
again reiterated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not duly
mindful of such an obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
petition, then, to set aside respondent Court's orders complained of possesses
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this special civil action for certiorari filed with us on July
7, 1967, Petitioner, after the usual allegations as to parties, referred to its
motion to dismiss appeal of respondent <span class="SpellE">Rals</span>
Construction, Inc., then with respondent Court, as its record on appeal failed
to show on its face that the appeal, was perfected within the period fixed by
the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondent, asked to comment on said motion, admitted that its record on appeal
lacked the necessary data as to when the decision was received by its counsel
for the purpose of determining whether or not its appeal was perfected on
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, on April 12, 1967,
respondent Court of Appeals, acting on petitioner's motion to dismiss appeal
resolved to deny the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, on
May 10, 1967, a motion for reconsideration of such resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court did not see any occasion to
change its stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its original ruling
was maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition for
certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer of August 11, 1967, respondent <span class="SpellE">Rals</span>
Construction, Inc., while admitting that its record on appeal did not show on its
face when the decision thus elevated to the Court of Appeals was received by
its counsel for the purpose of determining whether or not such an appeal was
timely, would submit, however, that it was so filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period as shown by the certification of the
City Sheriff of Manila, which fact was given due consideration by respondent
Court in denying the motion to dismiss appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From its view of the case, there was a sound and judicious exercise of
what it considered to be a discretion vested in respondent Court under the
above circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, the denial was characterized by it as conforming to "the highest
tradition of judicial statesmanship."</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for oral argument on August 16, 1968, but both
parties decided to submit memoranda instead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner did submit a memorandum of arguments and authorities, but
really more of the latter, citing the previous cases relied upon of Government
v. Antonio,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Development Bank of the Philippines v. Santos,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> v. Madrigal &amp; Co., Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and Atlas Consolidated Mining &amp; Development Corporation v. Progressive
Labor Association.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is its contention that respondent Court did err in departing from the
established rulings laid down in the above cases, thus "acting without or
in excess of its jurisdiction in which case certiorari would lie."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> A
realization of the force inherent in the above decisions must have led private
respondent, in its memorandum, to limit their applicability when the appellate
court "is at a loss to determine whether or not the appeal was perfected
on time on the basis of the record on appeal."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There can be no
doubt that the rule was intended to appraise the appellate court to which the
appeal is taken of the timeliness of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where therefore, as in this case, the
appellate court is convinced that the appeal was perfected on time, there is
neither rhyme nor reason, logic or persuasion to close its eyes to the reality
of the perfection of the appeal and allow itself to indulge in technicality
which the rules itself abhors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were the
court to do that, it would be placing premium on language instead of substance,
purpose and reason."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If this were a new question, the element of persuasiveness in the
above summation of private respondent cannot be completely ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps respondent Court could be considered
as not completely lacking in justification in denying the motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crux of the controversy,
however, is the failure of respondent Court to accord deference to a doctrine
repeatedly upheld by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would not be inaccurate, then, to assert that it did abuse its discretion and
abused it gravely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thus find for petitioner.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is required by the
rules of Court that the record on appeal should contain such data as will show
that it was perfected on time, a failure to do so being a ground for its
dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
From Government of the Philippines v. Antonio,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the resolution dismissing the appeal being promulgated on Oct. 19, 1965, it has
been the constant holding of this Court that dismissal will be the consequence
of a failure to comply with the above procedural requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth by Justice J. B. L. Reyes for a
unanimous Court in the Antonio resolution:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The deficiencies pointed out are fatal.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reason that in ordinary appeals the
original record is not forwarded to the appellate court, and because the dates
when an applicant received the notice of the pertinent orders or judgment under
appeal, and of the denial of his motions for reconsideration or new trial, are
facts within the exclusive knowledge of said appellant, the Revised Rules of
Court place upon the appellant the burden of showing that his appeal is timely,
and for that purpose prescribe (Rule 41, sec. 6) that the record of appeal
shall include 'such data as will show that the appeal was perfected on time.'
This requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional, for unless appeal is
perfected on time the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction over the
appealed case, and has power only to dismiss the appeal (<span class="SpellE">Bello</span>
vs. Fernando, L-16970, Jan. 30, 1962; <span class="SpellE">Caisip</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabangon</span>, L-14684, August 26, 1960; <span class="SpellE">Espartero</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ladaw</span>, 49 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>.
1439).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certification of the record
on appeal by the trial court after expiration of the period to appeal cannot
restore the jurisdiction which has been lost (<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>
vs. De la Rosa, 76 Phil. 428, 433, and cases cited).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle is confirmed by Rule 50,
section 1, supra (a), heretofore quoted."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It sufficed for this Court, speaking through Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
in Development Bank of the Philippines v. Santos,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
in dismissing the appeal, again on that ground, to refer to the above excerpt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then, in J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> v. Madrigal
&amp; Co., Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
an attempt was made to limit the scope of the Antonio ruling by the allegation
that even if the record on appeal did not comply, if in fact there was a
perfection within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, such a
rule need not be followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
we adhered to the Antonio doctrine for, as noted by Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, who penned the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Obviously, this amendment would become
useless and its purpose completely defeated, if we gave thereto the
interpretation advocated by the main respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, we would have the same issues
and the same waste of time that were sought to be eliminated by the
amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, our ruling in
Government vs. Antonio * * *, which, it should be noted, was made, not in a
decision, but, in a resolution, so that the public may know immediately -
instead of waiting for the decision on the merits, which might require more
time - the effect of said amendment, and the injurious consequences of a
failure to grasp its full import could thus be minimized."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequent to the filing of the memoranda of both parties in this litigation,
adherence to the above doctrine was again manifested in the two cases of <span class="SpellE">Jocson</span> v. Robles<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and Cadiz v. Secretary of National Defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The merit of the
petition is thus apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action
taken by respondent in denying the motion to dismiss is difficult to explain,
much less justify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not as if its
attention to the above decisions were not called.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the Antonio and the Santos rulings were
included as annexes to such motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, the minute resolution was apparently oblivious of the force
of such decisions; it did not even refer in the most casual manner to their
peremptory character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fate reserved
for them was one of studied indifference and neglect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration was sought to
be reinforced by the addition of the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> and the
Shell Co. decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was all in
vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court could not be
budged from the stand taken by it.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The spirit of initiative and independence on the part of men of
the robe may at times be commendable, but certainly not when this Court, not
once but at least four times, had indicated what the rule should be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had spoken clearly and unequivocally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no ambiguity in what we said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our meaning was clear and unmistakable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did take pains to explain why it must be
thus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were within our power in doing
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not be too much to expect,
then, that tribunals in the lower rungs of the judiciary would, at the very
least, take notice and yield deference.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice Laurel had indicated in terms too clear for misinterpretation
what is expected of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "A
becoming modesty of inferior courts demands conscious realization of the
position that they occupy in the interrelation and operation of the integrated
judicial system of the nation."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In the constitutional sense; respondent Court is not excluded from such a
category.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The grave abuse of discretion is thus manifest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of certiorari is granted, and the
resolution of respondent Court of April 12, 1967 denying petitioner's motion to
dismiss as well as its resolution of May 31, 1967 denying petitioner's motion
