				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The accused in this case, Refugio <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and Enrique Salve, were prosecuted for
and convicted of the crime of robbery with homicide by Branch IV of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first two, <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>, had in their favor two mitigating
circumstances of voluntary surrender and lack of instruction and were sentenced
to suffer an indeterminate penalty of six years to one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> and fourteen years, eight
months and one day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As no mitigating circumstance was found to
exist to call for a punishment less severe, Enrique Salve was meted out the
penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is the sole appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the lower court, his defense was that of
alibi, his allegation being that he left <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> two days before the crime was committed
and that he was already in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
at such time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court did not
lend credence to his defense, relying instead on the positive identification of
the widow, the sole eyewitness, as well as a statement of the victim given the
next morning which, while not amounting to an <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u>
declaration, in its opinion, was considered as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There appears to be in this appeal less of an insistence on the alibi,
but he would deny that there was proof beyond reasonable doubt, specifically
assailing likewise the admissibility of the statement of the deceased as part
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not successful, however, in
demonstrating that his conviction is not warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The widow, <span class="SpellE">Marcellana</span> <span class="SpellE">Delloro</span>, testified that around <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1963</st1:date>, while she and her husband, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaspay</span>, were lying in bed
in their house at <span class="SpellE">Cansamada</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, they heard appellant
Enrique Salve calling out from the outside asking for a light for their
cigarettes.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Her husband opened the door at the lower basement, apparently not suspecting
anything as appellant was related to him, being the first cousin of his wife,
the witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the door being opened
by the deceased, the accused, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>,
"hacked him with a long bolo on the head."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, according to her testimony, "Enrique Salve and Refugio <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span> followed and they helped each other in wounding my
husband, the three of them."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
When asked what instrument was used in inflicting such wounds, this was her
answer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The three of them were
using bolos."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Specifically, the other injuries sustained by the deceased were on the
abdominal region and his upper arm.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
They then pointed their bolos at the witness, searched her body and were able
to get the amount of P625. 00 in cash from a belt tied to her waist,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="GramE">Not</span> satisfied, they likewise took away a suitcase
containing a <span class="SpellE">Bulova</span> watch valued at P70.00, clothes
belonging to the couple, as well as two towels.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All-in-all, the monetary loss sustained by them amounted to
P855.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, according to
her, a patrolman, <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramulte</span>,
investigated the matter, but as the victim was already in a serious condition
about to be taken to the hospital, all that they could get from him, as
mentioned earlier, was <span style="">a </span>statement
which he could not even sign wherein he mentioned that appellant was, along
with Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and Refugio <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>,
responsible for the robbery <span style="">as </span>well
as the wounds received by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
victim died the next day, <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="3">March 26,
 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could identify all
the accused as there was at that time "a <span class="SpellE">lamparilla</span>",
a kerosene lamp, at their window with enough light to enable her to see who
were the perpetrators, all of whom she had known for sometime.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Her testimony <span style="">was </span>not
shaken on cross-examination, the counsel for the accused limiting himself at
the most to the absence of any ill-will between the couple and his clients and
ascertaining how the victims could have accumulated P625.00 in cash.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
There was likewise an effort to discredit the statement of the deceased as he
was alleged at that time to be "too weak and in a very serious condition,
* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
A line of questioning sought to elicit in greater detail how the crime was
committed, her memory being tested as to the attendant circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When specifically asked as to how she came to
believe that the accused had robbery in mind, this was her answer:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I already thought that they would rob
me inasmuch as my husband was already down and helpless, and there was no
misunderstanding between my husband and the intruders."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
She likewise explained that she was not vocal in her protest when they were
searching her, as at the time she "was already weak."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, she "was afraid of them."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
She emphasized, though, that she "shouted when they were striking my
husband and that was the time I asked for help."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant Enrique Salve opened his testimony
with the denial of the declaration of the widow, <span class="SpellE">Marcellana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delloro</span>, that on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1963</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time>
in the evening, he went to their house, inflicted the wounds on her husband,
and that he was one of the three accused who robbed the couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said it was not true because he "was
not there."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
He would impress on the court that as far back as <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1963</st1:date>, he "was here in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
When queried as to why he was there in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
his reply was that he "was leaving for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>."
Then he stated further that he arrived at the waiting shed of the pier in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the
morning looking for a certain Leo Acosta who promised that he would secure a
pass for him to enable him to travel as a passenger.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
He did find the friend who took him to the boat, the <u>General de Jesus</u>,
where another man whose family name he had forgotten, called Doming, did secure
such a pass, after which he was told to load his things in the boat.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
After being assigned a cot beside that of Doming, the next thing he knew, as he
fell asleep soon afterwards, was that he was at sea between <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>
and <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The first port of call was <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, and from there
the boat went to its way to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
where he did arrive on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1963</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There he left Doming and went to the house of his brother in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> where he stayed until <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1964</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
He informed the lower court that his purpose in going to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
was to look for work and that he succeeded in getting employment as a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver plying the Sta. Mesa-<span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span>
route.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
He would attribute his being implicated in the case to the fact that the father
of <span class="SpellE">Marcellana</span> <span class="SpellE">Delloro</span> had a
grudge against his father for alleged land-grabbing.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross-examination, he was right away confronted with the fact that while he
claimed to have stayed in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
from <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1963</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1964</st1:date>, it would appear from
the record that he was arrested on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="11">November
 19, 1963</st1:date> in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On redirect examination, he denied that such
was the fact although he admitted that it was in a barrio in <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span> that such arrest was <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked directly by the lower court, he
was insistent that from <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1963</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1964</st1:date>, he never
came back to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again private prosecutor did impress on the
court that on February 26, 1964 it was clear from the certificate of arraignment
that in open court and in the presence of a provincial fiscal, appellant
Enrique Salve was informed of the nature of the accusation filed against him
and that he pleaded not guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must also be stated that his being on board the <u>General de Jesus</u>
which left <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1963</st1:date>, his cot being beside that of Doming, was
corroborated by witness Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> who bore that
nickname.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was likewise
confirmation of his testimony that on Sunday evening, March 24, when the boat docked
at the pier of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, appellant
and this witness alighted together, after which they separated.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted at the outset, the lower court chose to accept the
version of the prosecution and rejected the alibi set up resulting in the
conviction of appellant Enrique Salve.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be borne in mind likewise that its judgment as to the guilt of
the accused was further based on an <u>ante mortem</u> statement of the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaspay</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
which, while not coming within the doctrine of a dying declaration, in the
opinion of the lower court, was considered as being part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u> statement<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
was taken by a policeman, <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramulte</span>, at past <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time>
the next morning, eleven hours or so after the accident, when the victim was in
a jeep to be taken to <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> for medical treatment.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The other person present was a brother of the deceased, Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Gaspay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time, the wounded man was in a hammock inside such jeep in a very weak
condition, his color being pale, evidently caused by the loss of blood coming
from the two wounds, fatal in character, one at the forehead and the other at
the stomach.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Only six questions were asked by <span class="SpellE">Ramulte</span>,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his name, where he was wounded,
why he was wounded, who were the assailants, were they successful in their
mission, and the weapon used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="GramE">answers in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> was</span> that he was
<span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaspay</span>; he was
wounded in his house as the result of a robbery; and that his three assailants
were Enrique Salve, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>, and Refugio <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>, who used their bolos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not even sign the statement as he
was then in a critical condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
patrolman and the brother, Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Gaspay</span>, affixed
their signatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the above evidence,
the lower court rendered a judgment of conviction which is now sought to be
reviewed on appeal by Enrique Salve.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi is practically abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, his brief would stress on this Court
that such a decision, as far as appellant was concerned, is vitiated by a
failure of evidence to show his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the first, third, and fourth errors could
be summarized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main reliance is on
the failure of the two other <span class="GramE">co-accused</span>, Refugio <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>, to
mention that appellant Enrique Salve was with them when the crime was
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy to understand why
it should be thus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of itself, such
circumstance could not be the basis for an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Refugio <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>
would claim self-defense, alleging that without provocation the deceased, then
drunk, challenged him to a fight and only when his life was in danger because
of the bolo in the hands of the deceased was he compelled to defend himself
with his own bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering his
testimony, it is obvious why appellant's name was not even mentioned at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was with the version of the
other co-accused, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>, who informed the
court that he himself should not have been accused at all as he only
accompanied Refugio <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span> when the latter voluntarily
surrendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, between the
positive testimony as to identification of appellant and the implication to be
derived from the failure of the co-accused to mention his name, it cannot be an
error for the lower court to rely on the proof offered as to the participation
of appellant in the commission of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other error assigned is that the lower court should not have
considered the declaration as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
majority of this court feels that such a defense is not entirely lacking in
merit considering the lapse of time that occurred between commission of the
offense and the taking of the statement, namely eleven hours or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that in many of our
decisions where this doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span> has found acceptance, the imputation of the
guilt of the accused was made immediately after the commission of the criminal
act.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not mean, however, that appellant is thus entitled to be absolved of
criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place,
the positive identification by the widow is an obstacle too formidable to
overcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this Court likewise
is of the opinion that what was set forth in Exhibit A as a result of the
questioning of the victim by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Ramulte</span>
amounts to a dying declaration, as it is a statement coming from "a
seriously wounded person"<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
even if death occurs "hours or days after it was inflicted" if there
be showing that it was due to the wound whose gravity did not diminish from the
time he made his declaration "until the end came."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
The principle is thus well-settled that there is no need for proof that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> state "that he has given up the hope of
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough if, from the
circumstances, it can be inferred with certainty that such must have been his
state of mind."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus "it is sufficient that the circumstances are such as to lead
inevitably to the conclusion that at the time [of such statement] the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> did not expect to survive the injury from which
he actually died."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
To repeat, its admissibility is not affected by death <span class="SpellE">occuring</span>
"hours or days" afterwards.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A recent decision is likewise in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Judged by the nature and extent of the injury inflicted (deep stab
wound on the abdomen, causing his intestines to protrude), <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>
