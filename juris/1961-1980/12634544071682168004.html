				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original petition for <u>certiorari</u> and
prohibition with preliminary injunction filed by <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>, a pauper litigant to set aside an order
of the respondent judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span> of the Court of Industrial Relation (CIR)
transferring the hearing of case 182-V-Cebu before him from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
case 182-V against the respondent <span class="SpellE">Robaco</span>
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the reception of his
evidence, the respondent judge set the hearing in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the place of business of the company.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner moved for reconsideration, <span class="GramE">but</span>
the respondent judge denied his motion.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The petition charges that, in so doing, the respondent judge acted in <span style="">excess </span>of jurisdiction and with grave
abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents justify the disputed order on the basis of
section 1 of Commonwealth Act 103 which gives the CIR juris­diction "over
the entire <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to consider, investigate, decide and settle all questions, matters,
controversies, or disputes arising between, and/or affecting employees or
laborers… and regulate the relations between them . . . ."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also claim that the petition is
premature because the peti­tioner did not first elevate the matter to the CIR <u>in</u>
<u>banc</u> before bringing it up<span style=""> </span>to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall first dwell on the technical objection raised.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents invoke <span class="SpellE"><u>Broce</u></span>
<u>v.</u> <u>Court</u><i> </i><u>of</u> <u>Industrial</u> <u>Relations</u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></u></span></a>
in which this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1 of said Commonwealth Act
No. 103 ex­pressly provides that if any of the parties ag­grieved by a decision
or ruling of any of the judges, requests for a reconsideration of said
decision, it must be presented to the judges who shall sit together, and that
the concur­rence of at least three of the five judges shall be necessary for
the pronouncement of a decision, order, or award.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This provision has always been followed in
cases of appeals to this Court by certiorari. . . . The provision does not
authorize an appeal from any decision made by <span style="">a </span>judge but only <u>from</u> <u><span style="">decisions</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>court</u> . . . ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fallacy of the respondents' argument is that it assumes that
the present case <span style="">is </span>an appeal
by <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style="">, </span>which it is not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated at the outset, this is an <span style="">ori­</span>ginal petition for <u>certiorari</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinction between an <u><span style="">appeal</span></u><span style=""> <u>by</u></span><span style=""> </span><u>certiorari</u>
and a <u>special</u> <u>civil</u> <u>action</u> <u>of</u> <u>certiorari</u> <span style="">is basic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Th<span style="">e</span> first is <span style="">governed by Commonwealth </span><span style="">Act 103 in </span><span style="">connection with Rule 43 and is a mode of appeal whereby mat­ters of law
may be reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a special civil action governed by Rule 65 by which questions of jurisdiction
may be determined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of appeal by <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style=""> </span>it is plausible to argue that a
motion for reconsideration before the CIR <u>in</u> <u>banc</u> is necessary
because the statute<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
authorizes an appeal only "from a decision, order, <span class="GramE">award</span>
of the Court of Industrial Relations."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A motion for reconsideration is thus in effect an appeal to the CIR <u>in</u>
<u>banc</u> as there can be no <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> decision of
that court until it shall have acted as a body on the motion for
reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, no such requirement can be read into <span style="">the statute with </span>respect to a <span style="">special civil action of <u>certio­</u></span><u>rari</u>
for, as each judge participates in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
so may his acts be kept within bounds <span style="">by
a resort to the extraordinary remedy of <u>certiorari</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As section 1 of Rule 65 indicates, <u>certiorari</u>
</span><span style="">is available not only against </span><span style="">a tribunal or </span><span style="">board but also against any "of­ficer exercising judicial functions
who has </span><span style="">acted without or </span><span style="">in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with
grave </span><span style="">abuse of discretion.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The
only condition </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that there </span><span style="">is </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">no </span><span style="">appeal nor</span></span><span style=""> any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy
in the ordi­nary course of law open to the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That the use of the
remedy in this case is particularly appropriate </span><span style="">is beyond </span><span style="">question, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">relief from the injurious effects of the disputed interlocutory order
would have to await the rendition of a decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the time judgment shall have been rendered
it will be useless for the petitioner to contend that the hearings should
continue in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While,
therefore, the proceedings in a given case should normally not be allowed to go
of on procedural points, especially when in­terlocutory orders are in issue,
the urgency and the peculiar </span><span style="">environmental
circumstances obtaining in the case at bar and </span><span style="">the obvious inadequacy of appeal as a remedy make resort to <u>certiorari</u>
fully justified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">And now
to the merits of the petition.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In justifying the transfer </span><span style="">of
venue to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Butuan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, the respondent judge states in his order of
</span><st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="10"><span style="">October </span><span style="">20, </span><span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court cannot agree on this proposition <span style="">because the Court of Industrial Relations has
the power to conduct hearings anywhere in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philipp</span>ines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in order to receive the evidence of the par­ties, <span class="GramE">specially</span>
in the place of business operations of the employer firm in order to evaluate
the circumstances leading to the lay-off of an employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the policy of the law creating this
Court in the interest of justice that <span style="">It
</span>my <span style="">go to any </span>place <span style="">in </span><span style="">the Philippines in order to hear the parties and receive their evidence
</span>so <span style="">that in the resolution of</span><span style=""> </span>the issue
or issues which gave rise to the proceeding may be properly appreciated and
considered (<u>sic</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise
of its ample power this Court found that the request of counsel for the
respondents <span style="">to </span>transfer the
place for the reception of their evi­dence in its place of business <span style="">is, </span>to our opinion, in consonance with
justice and fair play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
believes that there is no abuse of its discretion because it afforded
complainant the benefit of the hearing and the reception of his evidence in his
place of<span style=""> </span>residence;
and if the Court will refuse <span style="">to concede
</span>the same right to the other party, it is, to the mind of the Court, not
in consonance with reason, fair play and the social justice po­<span style="">licy of Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The records do not disclose the nature of petitioner's action
before the CIR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can only surmise that
it is for separation pay on account of his "lay-off" from the
respondent company's employment.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
But whatever be the nature of his action, we cannot see why it was necessary
for the court to transfer the hearings to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
with all the expenses that the transfer would entail to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge says that it is as much the right of the
company to have the hearing in its place of business as it is the right of the
petitioner to have his evidence received in his place of residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is palpable error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act 1171 expressly provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any provision of law or the Rules of Court to
the contrary notwithstanding, civil ac­tions on claims of employees, laborers
and other helps may be commenced and tried in the court of competent
jurisdiction where the defendant or any <span style="">of
the defendants resides or may be found, or where the plaintiff or any of the
plaintiffs resides, <u>at </u></span><u>the </u><u><span style="">election of the plaintiff</span></u><span style="">." </span><span style="">(<span class="GramE">emphasis</span> </span><span style="">supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We</span> think it plain
that once laid venue cannot be changed save of course with the consent of the
parties or for over­riding reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
be changed on the ground that the CIR has jurisdiction over the whole country
just as the venue of an ordinary civil action cannot be changed from one
province to another on the reasoning that Courts of First Instance are courts
of general original jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed section 1 Republic Act 1171 is no different from the rule governing or­dinary
civil actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, section 2(b) of
Rule 4 provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All other actions may be commenced and tried where the
defendant or any of the defendants resides or may be found, or where the
plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs resides, at the election of the
plaintiff."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The choice of venue is
thus given to a plaintiff employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
choice would be rendered meaningless were we to hold that, </span>while an
employee ma<span style="">y initially </span>choose
the venue <span style="">of </span>his action, he may
not be heard to complain later against the subsequent transfer of that
venue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can the choice be delimited
by the fact that the jurisdiction of the CIR covers the entire country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, much of the difficulty apparent from
a reading of the challenged order is due to <span style="">a </span>confusion of the issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the question here is not <u>jur</u><u><span style="">isdiction</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It <span style="">is </span>simply <u>venue</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a more compelling reason for insisting in this case that
the choice of venue be preserved to the plaintiff employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is that he is so poor he cannot even
defray the cost of these proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"He who has less in life should have more in law," is more
than just a credo of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
principle enshrined in the Constitutional mandate to afford protection to
labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Had the respondent judge been guided by this principle he would
not have felt compelled, by what he deemed to be the demands of justice, to
accord to the respondent company the "right" to be heard in its place
of business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor would he have felt
empowered to remove the cause from whence it was first laid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For the discretion of which
the respondent judge speaks in his order is not an unfettered one, though this
may sound paradoxical.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">judge,</span> writes <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, even when
he is free, is still not wholly free.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"He is not to innovate at pleasure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is not a knight-errant roaming at will in pur­suit of his own ideal
of beauty or of goodness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is to draw
his inspiration from consecrated principles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and unregulated
benevolence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is to exercise a
discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system,
and subordinated to 'the primordial necessity of order in the social life.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wide enough in all conscience is the field of
discretion that remains"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
And we might add that the kind of justice which courts are called upon to
disperse is justice according to the precepts of law.</p>
