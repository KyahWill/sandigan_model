				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioners, by way of prohibition with preliminary injunction, question the validity of Memorandum Order No. 1, dated January 3, 1972, assigning the petitioner Chief of Police of Pasay City with the office of respondent Mayor Pablo Cuneta as consul­tant on police matters, and Memorandum Order No. 10, dated Jan­uary 4, 1972, designating respondent Carlos T. Galvez as respondent mayor's representative to take charge of all his orders relating to all police matters to render more effective his power of control and supervision over the Pasay police force, as acts allegedly contrary to law intended to deprive petitioner Roland C. Siquijor of his lawful appointment and position as qualified Chief of Police of Pasay City without lawful cause and due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On January 13, 1972, this Court issued a preliminary injunction, to wit:<br><blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, effective immediately and until further orders from this Court, You, Your agents, representatives, assigns or any persons acting upon your orders, place or stead, are hereby enjoined from executing and enforcing Memorandum Order Nos. 1, dated January 3, 1972, and No. 10, dated January 4, 1972, both issued by herein respondent Pablo Cuneta."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Pertinent undisputed facts of record are:<br><br>On September 11, 1971, petitioner Roland C. Siquijor was extended a promotional appointment as Chief of Police of Pasay City by then City Mayor Jovito O. Claudio, vice Francisco A. Villa, who resigned when he became a candidate during the elections of 1971.&nbsp; Petitioner Siquijor qualified and took his oath of office on the same date.&nbsp; Said appointment was approved by the Civil Service Commission on September 23, 1971.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On January 3, 1972, first official day of office of newly elected respondent Pasay City Mayor Pablo Cuneta, he issued his contested Memorandum Order No. 1, assigning petitioner Chief of Police Roland C.

Col. Carlos T. Galvez (respondent), as assistant to the respondent Mayor, was designated to take charge of all policies and orders of the City Mayor relating to all police matters to render more effective his power of control and supervision over the police force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Pasay Law and Conscience Union, Inc., a duly orga­nized corporation, civic, non-profit, and non-partisan, allegedly dedicated to the "rule of law and conscience" joined petitioner Roland C. Siquijor in the present petition for prohibition, question­ing the respondents' acts as designed to clandestinely remove or ease out petitioner Siquijor as Pasay City Chief of Police, to ex­clude him from the use and enjoyment of his rights and privileges appertaining to said office, and to strip him of his powers and duties tantamount to removal from office without lawful cause or due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In an answer to the petition dated February 1, 1972, respondents claim that Memorandum Orders Nos. 1, 4, 5 and 6 by respondent Mayor were issued in good faith to devise ways and means of strengthen­ing the Pasay Police Force.&nbsp; It is alleged that Memorandum Order No. 1 was never implemented because of petitioner's letter dated January 3, 1972, requesting a reconsideration.&nbsp; Memorandum Order Nos. 4, 5 and 6, dated January 3, 1972, were all revoked by Memorandum Order No. 10, dated January 4, 1972.&nbsp; Respondents claim that as the questioned Memorandum Order No. 1, was not implemented and as Memorandum Orders Nos. 4, 5 and 6 were revoked, the petition did not present a justiciable issue and asked for its dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After the present petition had been filed on January 8, 1972, and after this Court had already issued a preliminary injunction on January 13, 1972, respondent Mayor issued a Memorandum Circular, on January 23, 1972, to all divisions, bureaus and sections chiefs of the Pasay City Police Department, apparently recalling his Memo­randum Orders Nos. 1, dated January 3, 1972 and 10, dated January 4, 1972, but at the same time stating that they were issued in conformity with respondent mayor's power of control and supervision over the Pasay City Police Department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On February 9, 1972, petitioners filed a Supplemental Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> claiming that on January 12, 1972, respondent Mayor issued a memorandum order to the effect that "all memorandum orders, personal orders, indorsements, or any other communication pertaining to police matters should be coursed to the undersigned thru Lt. Col. Carlos Galvez, Assistant to the Mayor, now presently holding office at the Police Headquarters."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Petitioners claim that the aforementioned memorandum order is an implementation of the questioned Memorandum Orders Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 10 by the respondent Mayor and General Order No. 72-01 by respondent Galvez, intended to strip petitioner Siquijor of his powers, duties and functions as Chief of Police of Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On January 31, 1972, apparently to implement the questioned aforementioned memorandum orders and general order, respondent Mayor, in disregard of this Court's injunction issued on January 13, 1972,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> issued a memorandum order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> addressed to all department heads of the Pasay City Government, advising them that since respondent Mayor assumed office he has taken over the control and supervision of the Pasay Police Department, and all matters relative to police office work/activities and other allied police duties concerning the depart­ment and/or its individual members like vacation/sick leave applications, vouchers, salaries/payrolls should be submitted to the respon­dent Mayor for approval and/or signature.<br><br>On February 2, 1972, implementing further the same questioned memorandum orders and general order, and again in defiance of this Court's preliminary injunction, respondent Mayor issued a memo­randum circular<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to all Chiefs of Bureaus/Division/Section of the Pasay City Police Department, calling attention to the wanton de­fiance of his memorandum order dated January 12, 1972, and warning that further wilfull and deliberate defiance of said directive shall be dealt with accordingly and drastically.<br><br>Petitioners claim in the Supplemental Petition that by his acts, respondent Mayor continuously defies the injunction issued by this Court, in acting as the Chief of Police of Pasay City.<br><br>On February 11, 1972, petitioners, by "Manifestation Re-Contempt of Court," prayed that respondents be cited and punished for contempt, for defying this Court's preliminary injunction issued on January 13, 1972, by taking over all the powers, functions, duties of petitioner Chief of Police of Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On February 18, 1972, petitioner, by "Urgent Motion", informed this Court that respondent Mayor tried to eject the petitioner Chief of Police from his office, said move predicated on a letter by the Civil Service Commissioner dated February 16, 1972, to the effect that the approval of the appointment of petitioner Chief of Police had been revoked.&nbsp; Petitioners pray that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court on January 13, 1972, be amended so as to place the parties in <i>status quo</i> pending the decision of this case, in as much as the legality of the appointment of petitioner Chief of Police is an issue in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On February 21, 1972, this Court amended the preliminary in­junction, to wit:<br><blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, effective immediately and until further orders from this Court, You, Your agents, representatives, assigns or any persons acting upon your orders, place or stead, are hereby enjoined from executing and enforcing Memorandum Order Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, all dated January 3, 1972, the letter to petitioner Roland C.

Amor as head of the police department, and that respondent mayor recalled said designation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>A rejoinder to answer was filed by petitioners on June 3, 1972, calling the attention of this Court to the repeated assurance of respondent Mayor that he did not intend to violate the preliminary injunction issued, and yet the repeated violations of the injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>This Court considered the case submitted for decision on June 13, 1972.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioner PLACU, together with the real party in interest, petitioner Chief of Police, is not disqualified to appear as petitioner in this case, because as a non-profit, civic and non-partisan organization, like the PHILCONSA, it is merely interested in up­holding the rule of law.<br><br>However, the question of the validity of the transfer of the petitioner, Rolando C. Siquijor, to the Office of the Mayor of Pasay City by the respondent Pablo Cuneta has become MOOT and ACA­DEMIC upon the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 421, in­tegrating the city and municipal police forces, jails and fire departments within the Greater Manila Area, which vested the "power to direct and control the tactical, strategic movements, deploy­ments, placements and/or utilization of the entire Metropolitan Police Force or any of its elements and components, equipment, facilities and other resources within its territorial jurisdic­tion," upon the Commanding General, PC METROCOM.<br><br>As to the continuous contempt of this Court allegedly perpe­trated by respondent Mayor in open defiance of this Court's preliminary injunction of January 13, 1972, and the amended writ of preliminary injunction dated February 22, 1972, all intended to place the parties in <i>status quo</i> pending the resolution of this case, and to prevent the respondent Mayor from interfering in the performance of duties of petitioner Chief of Police, it is of record that notwithstanding the existence of said injunction, respondent Mayor did the following acts:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">January 23, 1972, supposed recall of contested memorandum order Nos. 1 and 10, dated January 3 and 4, respectively, insisting that respon­dent Mayor's intention in issuing them was be­cause of his control and supervision over the Pasay Police Force;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> January 12, 1972, memorandum order to all officers and men of the Pasay Police Department, ordering them that all orders, indorsements, communication pertaining to police matters be coursed to the respondent Mayor, thru respondent Carlos Galvez;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">January 31, 1972, memorandum order to all department heads of the Pasay City Government, advising them that respondent Mayor since his assumption of office has taken over the control and supervision of the Pasay Police Department, and directing that all matters relative to police work be submitted to respondent Mayor for approval;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">February 2, 1972, memorandum circular to all chiefs of bureau, division, section, of the Pasay Police Department, informing them of the defiance to the respondent Mayor's January 12, 1972 memorandum order, directing all police matters to be coursed to respon­dent Mayor, thru respondent Carlos Galvez, And warning them that defiance of said direc­tive shall be dealt with accordingly;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(5)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">February 9, 1972, memorandum order, to Atty.

Notwithstanding the repeated pro­testations of good faith in doing those acts by respondent Mayor and his likewise repeated allegations of recall of those memorandum orders, his pattern of subtle defiance to this Court's injunction orders appears clearly defined.&nbsp; His acts show an obsession to remove and replace the petitioner Chief of Police, whatever be the means, even if the issue of the validity of the appointment of the petitioner is before this Court to determine as a justiciable issue.&nbsp; His defiance of this Court's injunction orders may be subtle and refined, yet it is by all means no less a defiance.&nbsp; Although con­tempt should not be utilized as a vindictive measure, this Court believes that respondent Mayor should be taught a lesson not to take this Court's injunction orders lightly and not to use means, bordering on schemes, to circumvent the effects of said injunctions.&nbsp; Respondent Mayor deserves punishment for contempt of this Court with a warning that a repetition of the same shall be dealt with more severely, as provided for under Secs. 3(b) and 6 of Rule 71, Rules of Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition should be, as it is hereby, dismissed.&nbsp; But the respondent Mayor Pablo Cuneta is hereby declared in contempt of this Court and fined P1,000.00; with double costs against respondents.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED. </b><br><br><i>Barredo, (Chairman), Aquino, Abad Santos</i>, and <i>De Castro, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> pp. 1-6, <i>rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> pp. 20-21, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> pp. 7-9, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> p. 10, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> p. 11, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> p. 12, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> p. 13, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> pp. 14-15, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> p. 16, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> p. 17, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> pp. 1, 4-5, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> pp. 28-30, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> p. 31, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> pp. 36-41, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> p. 42, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> p. 36, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> p. 20, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> p. 43, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> pp. 44, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> pp. 46-49, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> pp. 55-57, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> p. 63, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> pp. 73-100, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> pp. 84-88, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> pp. 88-89, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> pp. 89-90, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> p. 91, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> p. 97, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> pp. 121-156, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> pp. 179-191, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> pp. 194-197, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> pp. 203-310, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> pp. 218-225, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> p. 238, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> p. 31, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> p. 42, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> p. 43, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> p. 44, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> p. 50, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> pp. 51-53, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> P. 53, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> p. 55, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> p. 58, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> pp. 104-108, <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> p. 197, <i>Id.</i></div>
