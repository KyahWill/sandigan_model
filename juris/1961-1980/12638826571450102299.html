reconsideration of the assessment was sought but this was denied hence, <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> appealed to the Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City which in a decision dated <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1964</st1:date> reduced the new assessment from
P512<span class="GramE">,670.00</span> to its previous value of P116,690.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Assessor refused to implement the decision
of the Board of Assessment Appeals of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City and
instead elevated the matter for review to the Secretary of Finance in
accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 3275.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Brief of Petitioner, pp.1-3)</p>

damages against the City Assessor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
