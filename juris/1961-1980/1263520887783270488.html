				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On January 30, <span style="">1961, </span>the
respondents <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Pac &amp; Company, Inc. and Alfonso
Santos <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> were adjudged guilty of unfair labor
practice by the respondent Court of Industrial Relations and were consequently
ordered to pay certain workers, all members of the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Pac <span class="SpellE">Pakiao</span> Workers Union, <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the date of their unjust dismissal to the
date of the finality of the <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span> decision, without,
however, the benefit of reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both the Company and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> moved for
reconsideration of this decision, but their motions were denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal by the res­pondent Company, this
Court, <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Pac &amp; Company vs. CIR and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dy</span></span><span style=""> Pac <span class="SpellE">Pakiao</span> Workers Union, L-18460,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> affirmed the CIR decision in its entirety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon this Court's decision becoming final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1962</st1:date>, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
moved in the CIR for computation of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
awarded to its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1963</st1:date>, the chief examiner of the CIR
turned in his assessment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> based
principally on the time records and payrolls pertaining to the affected workers
for the period from August 25 to <st1:date year="1956" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1956</st1:date> -- the only records then extant and available for the
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the chief
examiner's report, the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> covering the period
from January 20, 1957 (the date when the workers ceased in their employment) to
December 1, 1962 (date of the finality of the decision of this Court) amounted
to a total of P65,122.59 corresponding to 17 of the 19 workers listed as
complainants in exhibit I, page of the original records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two workers, <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
Asada and Percival <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span>, were not included in the
computation due to the ab­sence of their names in the time records and payrolls
made available by the Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties filed their oppositions to the report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="11">November
 9, 1966</st1:date>, after evaluating the evidence adduced and hearing the
arguments of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, the CIR, through Judge
Joaquin Salvador, issued an order approving the chief examiner's report on the
whole, and ordering the inclusion of Percival <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span>
among the workers entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Asada
remained excluded, however, due allegedly to the absence of a sufficient basis
for his inclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the Company and
the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> took exception to this ruling, and moved for
modification thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1967</st1:date>,
after hearing duly had, the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> passed a resolution,
concurred in by three of its judges, with the two others not taking part,
modifying the order of <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="11">Nov­ember 9,
 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award was thereby
drastically reduced to only six months of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
the first three months corresponding to the time when the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> of the Company was operating without the
workers involved in this case, and the next three corresponding to an arbitrary
period during which the same workers would have, "in all
probability," found some other employment following the complete stoppage
of the operations of the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
also contained an order for the inclusion of <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
Asada upon a finding that, the latter was em­ployed at the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> during the time involved in this case <span style="">but </span>happened to be on sick leave when
the pertinent time records and payrolls were prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The name of Percival <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span>
was, however, caused to be excluded due to its non-appearance in the same time
records and payrolls.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> has come to this Court on a
special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> questioning the authority of the CIR <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> to render its resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="1">January
 28, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two issues posed for resolution we shall discuss <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>seriatim</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
original decision of <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="1">Jan­uary 30, 1961</st1:date>,
rendered by the CIR through Judge Jose Bautista, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CON­SIDERATIONS, the respondents
are hereby ordered to pay immediately the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
of the complain<span style="">ant workers, from the
date of the stoppage of work in the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>
up to the time when this decision shall become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
without reinstatement."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Subsequently, the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
through a resolution also penned by Judge Bautista, denied the motions for
reconsideration filed by both the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and the
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This resolution, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1961</st1:date>, stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondents moved for new trial and the reconsideration of
the decision of this Court dated <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1961</st1:date>; while complainant, in its motion for reconsideration,
prayed that said decision be modified in the sense that the company should also
be ordered to reinstate the workers in addition to the payment of their back
wages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a careful examination of the evidence of the parties,
together with the reasons given in the motions for reconsideration, we find
respon­dents' reasons for new trial and reconsideration of the decision of this
Court of January 30, 1961 with­out merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant's motion for reconsidera­tion also cannot be entertained
because there is no operation in the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The operation of the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>
depends upon a filer who could make the bunch of crates function smoothly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Alfonso Santos <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
abandoned the work, the work was stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then his son, Alfredo Santos <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> took
over, but he had to quit because he was not a competent filer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reinstate the workers concerned when there
is no work to be done would be injustice to the com­pany, because management
would be forced to give salaries to the workers even if they have nothing to
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the
punishment which this Court imposes upon any erring party is remedial and not
punitive in character.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, all motions for reconsideration should be, as they
are hereby, DENIED."</blockquote>

<blockquote>On appeal to this Court by the Company, we
decided the case (L-18460, <u>supra</u>) with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
statement:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"WHEREFORE, the decision
appealed from is hereby affirmed with costs against the appellant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, in now constricting the coverage
of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due to the workers from 5 years and
10 month plus to only 6 months, relied heavily on the argument that since the
work at the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> had been permanently
stopped after March 2, 1958 due to the non-availability of a qualified filer, <span style="">the </span>workers involved could not have
been reinstated to their former<span style=""> </span>jobs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> thus concluded
that whatever <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> these workers were entitled
to should not extend beyond the time when, had they been reinstated, they would
have nevertheless ceased working due to the legitimate shutting up of the <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court will not dwell on the validity of the legal
proposition that "<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should not extend
beyond the date o<span style="">f clo</span><span style="">sure of business where such closure was due
to legitimate business reasons and not merely to an attempt to defeat the order
for </span>reinstatement."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Without determining whether or not this precept applies to the peculiar
circumstances of the present case, it is our considered view that the CIR <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it delimited, as it did, the
workers' right <span style="">to </span>the recovery of
<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> as originally adjudicated in its decision
of January 30, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter decision
explicitly ruled that <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> were to span a period
commencing "from the date of the stoppage of work in the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> up to the time when <span style="">this </span>decision shall become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."
The pretension that this was modified by resolution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
cannot stand scrutiny because the same resolution merely rejected the parties'
motions for reconsideration and did not afford any kind <span style="">of </span>modified relief from the operation and effects of the judgment
<span style="">of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be remembered that while the body of a decision, order or
resolution might create some ambiguity regarding which way the court's
reasoning preponderates, it is the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion thereof that finally invests rights upon the parties, sets conditions
for the exercise of those rights, and imposes the corresponding duties or
obligations.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The award by the CIR of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from
the time the<span style=""> old</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> ceased operations up to the time its decision,
as affirmed by this Court, became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
is now the <u>law of the case</u> and is beyond the reach of review by the CIR
or by this C<span style="">ourt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By "law of the case" is meant that "whatever is
once in <span class="SpellE">revocably</span> established as the controlling
legal rule or decision between the same parties in the same case continues to
be the law of the case" so long as the "facts on which such decision
was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And once the decision becomes final, it is
binding on all inferior courts and, hence, beyond their power and authority to
alter <span style="">or </span>modify.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

is <u>apropos:<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"The equitable considerations that led the lower court to take
the action complained of can­not offset the demands of public policy and public
interest -- which are also responsive to the tenets of equity -- requiring that
all issues passed <span style="">upon in decisions or
final orders that have become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, be deemed
conclusively disposed of and definitely closed, for, otherwise, there would be
no end to litigations, thus setting at naught the main role of courts of
justice, which is to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and the main­tenance
of peace and order, by setting <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
controversies <u>with finality</u>."</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. The <span class="SpellE">ClR</span> <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, in its
resolution subject of the pre­sent action, ordered the name of Percival <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span> stricken from the list of workers entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, while at the same it ordered the restoration of
the name of <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Asada in the list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, unfortunately,
did not state its reasons for ousting <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can only infer that it based its ruling
upon the fact that <span class="SpellE">Echaluce's</span> name does not appear in
the only payrolls and time records available.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ultimate question we thus confront is whether or not evidence exists
regarding <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Echa</span>luce's</span>
employment with the Company during the time the <span style="">latter </span>committed acts constituting unfair labor practice,
independently of those payrolls and time records.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court need not venture far for the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of November 9, 1966 penned by Judge
Joaquin Salvador who conducted a hearing on the examiner's report, found with
respect to <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span> that "the evidence is clear
that he was working in the company when the old '<span class="SpellE">carro</span>'
ceased operation ... the reason why his name does not appear in the payrolls is
the fact that he was then absent when they were signed." The Company
appears not to have overcome this evidence, having relied solely on the
strength of the extant payrolls and time records.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, that Percival <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Asada were among the complainants in
L-18460, is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must, therefore, perforce be considered
as included within the coverage and intendment of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision of this Court in L-18460.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential question that confronts the CIR is merely one of
computation of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of these two
complainants, there being no record or payroll to indicate the exact amount of
the wages they were receiving at the time that the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>
stopped operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can, however,
with a certain degree of fairness, rely on the solution stated by Judge
Salvador in his order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="11">November
 9, 1966</st1:date>, which solution is apparently acceptable to both the
Company and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, there being no indica­tion in the
record to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This mode of
computation is expressed in the said order as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"His <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
should be based on the average of what his co-members received as shown in the
payrolls."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the resolution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
of January 28, 1967 is hereby modified so that, <u>first</u>, the compu­tation
of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> shall cover the period from the date of
the stoppage of work at the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> up to
December 1, 1962, the date the decision in the original case became final and <span class="SpellE">executo­ry</span>, and, <u>second</u>, Percival <span class="SpellE">Echaluce</span> and <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Asada are enti­tled
to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> which shall be based on the average of
what their co-workers received as shown in the pertinent payrolls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the workers herein involved may have
found other em­ployment or other means of livelihood after they were dismissed,
it is only just and equitable that whatever they may have earned during the
period covered by the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be
deducted from the total liability of the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this end the CIR is hereby directed to
admit pertinent evidence that may be adduced by the Company.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE<span style="">
CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</span> OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the disposition of the case as per the main opinion
of Mr. Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, but dissent <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
insofar as on the first and main issue it orders that "the computa­tion of
<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> shall cover the period from the date of
stoppage of work at the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> up to
December 1, 1962, the date the de­cision in the original case became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>", or a total amount of P65,122.59
corresponding to 17 of the 19 workers-complainants, which will now come up to
P72,784.07 (with the in­clusion now ordered of the two workers previously
excluded, at the same average of about P3,830.74 per worker), corresponding to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for a period of about <u>5 years and 10 months</u>
- less whatever earnings of said workers during the period may be proven by the
company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original decision of <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="1"><u>January
 30, 1961</u></st1:date> of the industrial court's trial Judge Bautista
sentenced the company "to pay <u>immediately</u> the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
of the complainant workers, from the date of the stoppage of work in the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> <u>up to the time when this decision shall
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, without reinstatement.</u>"<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In denying the motions for reconsideration filed by both the
company and the union, with the union asking for reinstatement of the workers,
Judge Bautista for the court <u>en banc</u> held in its resolution of <u>March
23, 1961</u> that "To reinstate the workers concerned <u>when there is no
work to be done would be injustice to the company, because management would be
forced to give salaries to the workers even if they have nothing to do.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the punishment which
this Court imposes upon any erring par­ty <u>is remedial and not punitive in
character.</u>" (emphasis supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, on appeal, in its decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="8"><u>August 24, 1962</u></st1:date> affirmed the lower court's
judgment of unfair labor practice with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"WHEREFORE, <u>the decision
appealed from</u> is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant."</p>

<p class="BODY">The present action concerns the execution of the industrial
court's original decision of <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1961</st1:date>, as upheld in the court's <u>en banc</u> resolution of <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1961</st1:date> and affirmed by this
Court on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, in its <u>en banc</u> resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1967</st1:date> drastically reduced
the award to only six months of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It upheld in effect the company's contention
that what this Court had af­firmed on appeal was not the lower court's decision
of January 30, 1961, "standing alone", (since the same could not be
the subject of an appeal) but said decision, as "amended or modified by
the findings of fact and of law as contained in the resolution (<u>en banc</u>)
of <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1961</st1:date>, which
had been appealed to and affirmed by this Honorable Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It found "that from <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1957</st1:date> [the date of stoppage of operation of the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>] to <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="12">December
 2, 1957</st1:date>, the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> was not
operated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, since it was not in
operation, the complaining workers could not have earned anything even if they
were allowed to work, for admittedly, their work was dependent on the operation
of the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span><u>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, since they did not lose
anything, they can­not recover what they could not have lost."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It further found that "from <st1:date year="1957" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1957</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1958</st1:date>, or a period of three (3) months, the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> was operated without the complaining
workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said complaining workers could
have earned something if they were allowed to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, it is but justifiable and
fair that t hey should be allowed to recover what they had lost in the form of
earnings for a period of three (3) months."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It also found that "(H)<span class="SpellE">owever</span>,

<p class="BODY">Applying the dictum in <u>Sta. Cecilia Sawmills, Inc. vs. CIR</u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
it ruled that "it is a fact that from March 2, 1958, the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> has not been operated, to prevent injustice to
the respondent (company) and in order not to foster indolence on the discharged
laborers, the herein complaining workers should be allowed to recover…… another
three months' <span class="SpellE">backearnings</span> (March 3, 1958 to June 3,
1958), considering that after the lapse of three months after March 2, 1958 (<u>last
day of operation</u>), as the Supreme Court ruled in the above-cited case in
all probability, they must have located some other work to tide them
over.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, therefore, in implementing the original deci­sion
of January 30, 1961, deemed that the same was modified by the court's unanimous
<u>en banc</u> resolution of March 23, 1961 setting the premises that the
company should <u>not</u> "be forced to give salaries <span style="">to the workers even if they have nothing to
do" and that the "punishment" imposed by it was "<u>remedial
and not punitive in character</u>", and that it was such decision, as so
modified, that was affirmed on appeal by this Court's decision of August 24,
1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court cited as justification for its drastic computa­tion
of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> at six months, the court's
pronouncement in <u>Durable Shoe Factory vs. CIR</u><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
that "<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should not extend beyond the
date of closure of business when such closure was due to legitimate reasons as
in the present case." To the same effect is the Court's ruling per the
Chief Justice in <u>San Pablo Oil Factory vs. CIR</u><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
that where the industrial court found the company guilty of discrimina­tory
lockout and directed reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
corresponding to the lockout period, the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
would be computed not on the basis of 85 "working days" during the
period but "should be limited to the thirty-nine (39) days in which the
factory was <u>actually in operation</u>, during the same period" for
"(I)<span class="SpellE">ndeed</span>, even if there had been no lock­out,
the laborers in question could not have possibly worked when the <span style="">factory was not in actual operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could not have earned any wages except
for the days of said actual operation……."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Uytiepo</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Aggabao</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></u></span></a>
where the Court on execu­tion proceedings, modified and reduced the terms of
the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment assessing "the
fixed sum of P200 per month as reason­able rental for (<span class="SpellE">Aggabao's</span>)
use of the tractor [from October 18, 1957] until its return to the petitioners
"because she had sold the tractor in question to a third party without
even having apprised the court which rendered the final judgment of payment of
rentals until the tractor's return, may likewise be cited in support of the
industrial court's ques­tioned resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For in the case at bar, the industrial court was properly apprised of
the permanent stoppage of operation of the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>
since March 2, 1958, and the workers could not have earned any wages thereafter
even if they had not been unjustly dismissed in January, 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">But strictly abiding by the <u>law of the case</u>, as enunciated
in the main opinion, I believe that it seems clear from the facts and circums­tances
of the case that the industrial court's decision of January 30, 1961 <u>en banc</u>
and resolution of March 23, 1961 ordered the <u>immediate</u> payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for a <u>fixed period</u> from the stoppage of work
in the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> [i.e. from January 20, 1957]
to the date when <u>its decision</u> would become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
i.e. ten days from its <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution of March 23, 1961, or <u>up
to April 2, 1961</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of
twenty (20) months thereafter that elapsed until the Court resolved the
company's appeal in its decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="8">August
 24, 1962</st1:date> which, according to the main opinion, became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="12"><u>Decem­ber
 1, 1962</u></st1:date> was not contemplated and should not be considered as a <u>further
award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span></u> to the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a case of <span class="SpellE"><u>pakiao</u></span>
workers and the industrial court had definitely ruled that they could no longer
be reinstated as the operation of the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span>
had been per­manently stopped since <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="3"><u>March
 2, 1958</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, regardless
of their unjust dismissal on January 20, 1957, there was no longer any work
from <u>March, 1958</u> and they "could not have earned even if they were
allowed to work,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that is to say, even if they had not been unjustly dismiss in January, 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither could the Court's <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of
the decision appealed from be deemed as a further award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to the workers during <u>the twenty-month <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the appeal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal, after all,
had been given due course under Rule 43, section 3 and was not dismissed
outright under section 6 of the same Rule, if it were patently without merit,
manifestly dilatory or unsubstantial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, under section 10 of the Rule then applicable, the appeal
would not stay the industrial court's decision ordering the immediate payment
of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, and the same would have been <span class="SpellE">executory</span> notwithstanding the appeal, unless otherwise
directed by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote, therefore, to hold that at the most, the award by the
industrial court of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be computed from
the time the old <span class="SpellE"><u>carro</u></span> ceased operations on
January 20, 1957 to April 2, 1961, or an award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
for a period of about 4 years and 2 months, (instead of to December 1, 1962, or
a period of about 5 years and 10 months as directed in the main opinion), less
such earnings of the workers during the period as may be duly proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter date of April 2, 1961 was the <u>cut-off
date</u> clearly intended by the industrial court and <u>its decision</u> would
then have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, but for the
company's appeal which was given due course and for which the company should
not be penalized by construing our <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the
decision as an additional award for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for
twenty more months or for as long as <u>this Court's decision</u> shall not
have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
