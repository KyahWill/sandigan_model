				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. DIONISIO PALARAN, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 7, 1957, Dionisio Palaran presented with the Court of First Instance 
of Negros Occidental, a Petition for Naturalization, with the Alternative Prayer 
to Declare his Status as Filipino Citizen. His petition contained the usual 
allegations, such as his present and past places of residence, trade and 
occupation; date of birth, names and birth dates of his children and the schools 
in which they were enrolled; the length of his residence in the Philippines and 
in the place where the petition was filed; that he believes in the principles 
underlying the Philippine Constitution; that he has conducted himself in a 
proper and irreproachable manner; that he has mingled socially with Filipinos 
and has evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace the Filipino customs and 
traditions; that he is not opposed to organized government, nor is he affiliated 
with any group or society which upholds and teaches doctrines against organized 
government, etc. The petition was accompanied by the sworn statements of Socorro 
de los Reyes and Numeriano Cahilig, both Filipinos, who attested to his moral 
character and that they have known petitioner for years (de los Reyes since 1927 
and Cahilig since his birth); that he has all the qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications for Philippine citizenship.
<p>After trial, the lower court rendered judgment the pertinent portions of 
which read—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The evidence for the petitioner was focused more towards showing that he has 
always been a Filipino citizen than making out a case for naturalization. The 
witnesses were Numeriano Cahilig, 54 years old, a resident of Leon; Iloilo, and 
one time municipal president and vice-mayor, and Socorro de los Reyes, 48 years 
old and resident of Iloilo. The totality of their testimony, material to the 
view taken by the Court, shows that the parents (both deceased) of the 
petitioner were So Ong, a Chinese and Anastacia Palaran, a Filipino citizen; 
that So Ong was not and could not be legally married to Anastacia Palaran 
because he had a lawful wife in China; that the petitioner was never adopted by 
his Chinese father, So Ong. The deposition of Father Garcia is to the effect 
that the petitioner was baptized in the parish church of San Jose, Iloilo, on 
December 20, 1913, and that, according to its records, he is the natural child 
of Anastada Palaran (Exh. E-1).</p>
<p>With the uncontradicted fact that the petitioner is the natural son of 
Anastacia Palaran, a Filipino citizen, who was never-legally married to So Ong, 
the Court is bound to, as it does hereby, rule that following the citizenship of 
his mother, the petitioner is and has always been a Filipino (Luis Serra vs. 
Rep. of the Philippines, G. R. No. L-4223, May 12, 1952). This result dispenses 
with the necessity of determining whether the petition, as one for 
naturalization, may be granted. Petitioner's original Philippine citizenship 
cannot be affected by the circumstances that he is registered with the Embassy 
of the Republic of China as a citizen thereof and with the Bureau of Immigration 
as aa alien, for the reason that said registration, without more, is not 
sufficient for the petitioner to lose his status as a Filipino. Indeed, as 
explained in the verified petition, he secured during the Japanese occupation an 
alien certificate of registration in Bacolod City, because he believed in good 
faith that he was a Chinese citizen.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the petitioner, Dionisio Palaran, is declared a Filipino citizen 
and his registration as an alien in the Bureau of Immigration is ordered 
cancelled."</p></blockquote>
<p>Against the above decision, the State appealed claiming that the lower court 
erred:</p>
<ol><li>In concluding from the evidence submitted by petitioner-appelle, that the 
latter is the natural son of Anastacia Palaran, a Filipino citizen, who was 
never legally married to So Ong; 
</li><li>In declaring petitioner-appellee a citizen of the Philippines, and 
</li><li>In Ordering the Bureau of Immigration to cancel petitioner-appellee's 
registration as an alien. </li></ol>
<p>Granting that the findings of the trial court regarding the non-marriage of 
petitioner's parents, is correct, an issue which We abstain from deciding, it 
being unnecessary for the purposes of this opinion, it would seem, nevertheless, 
that the only question for determination is whether or not the trial court has 
the power, authority and jurisdiction to declare the petitioner a citizen of the 
Philippines (second assignment of error). Petitioner, invoking previous 
decisions of this Court on the matter, alleges that when the evidence of 
applicant proves his status as a Filipino citizen, he may be declared by the 
trial court such citizen in the same petition for naturalization, without the 
necessity of pressing the latter proceeding (Serra vs. Republic, G. R. No. 
L-4223, May 21, 1951; Sen et al. vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-6868, April 30, 1955; 
Sy Quimsuan vs. Republic, 92 Phil., 675; 49 Off. Gaz. [2] 492), In a recent case, 
however, this Court, in overruling the Sen case just cited and other previous 
cases, said:—</p>
<blockquote><p>"We have already ruled In the recent case of Danilo Channie Tan vs. Republic 
107 Phil., 632; 57 Off. Gaz., [90] 5401, that a judicial declaration that a 
person is a Filipino citizen can not be made in a petition for naturalization 
wherein it is prayed that petitioner 'be admitted a citizen of the Philippines', 
for the following reasons:&nbsp;
</p><p>'1. Under our laws, there can be so action or proceeding for the judicial 
declaration of the citizenship of an individual. Courts of justice exist for the 
settlement of justiciable controversies, which imply a given right, legally 
demandable arid enforceable, an act or omission violative of said right, and a 
remedy, granted or sanctioned by law, for said breach of right. As an incident 
only of the adjudication of the rights of the parties to a controversy, the 
court may pass upon, and make a pronouncement relative to, their status. 
Otherwise, such pronouncement is beyond judicial power. Thus, for instance, no 
action or proceeding may be instituted for a declaration to tile effect that 
plaintiff or petitioner is married, or single or legitimate child, although a 
finding thereon may be made as a necessary premise to justify a given relief 
available only to one enjoying said status. At times, the law permits the 
acquisition of a given status, such as naturalization, by judicial decree. But, 
there is no similar legislation authorizing the institution of a judicial 
proceeding to declare that a given person is part of our citizenry.'</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *<br> </p>
<p>The above holding, being the correct exposition and interpretation of the law 
involved, overrules our holdings in Pablo y Sen, et al., vs. Republic, G. R. No. 
L-6868, April 30, 1955, and other previous cases, to the effect that the court 
can make a declaration that an applicant for naturalization is a Filipino 
citizen in the same naturalization proceedings if the evidence so warrants.</p>
<p>Even assuming, therefore, that herein petitioner has shown that he is already 
a Filipino citizen, the lower court exceeded its power, authority and 
jurisdiction in declaring "him to be such in these naturalization proceedings". 
(Tan Yu Chin, vs. Republic of the Philippines, 111 Phil., 959; 6fc Off. Gaz. [47] 
7683; See also Tan vs. Republic, G.R. No. L-16108, Oct. 31, 1961).</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the case of naturalization, as the trial court has aptly stated, 
the petitioner did not make efforts to prove his qualifications. While his two 
character witnesses tried to show that he had all the qualifications imd no 
disqualifications, the petitioner himself failed to take the witness stand where 
he could have been examined regarding his ability to speak and write English or 
any of the local dialects; some customs and traditions of the Filipinos which he 
desired to imitate and other pertinent facts and circumstances which he himself 
could only make known to the court. He had relied much on his claim of being a 
Filipino, due to his status as a natural child, and relegated to oblivion the 
proofs, if any, for his allegations in the naturalization case. There was no 
showing either that the character witnesses were fully qualified to state that 
petitioner had conducted himself in a proper and "irreproachable" manner. The 
petition states but it was not proven, that the petitioner derived an annual 
income of P2,700.00 from his tinsmith shop. Even granting this to be true, still 
with 9 children and a wife to support, the said occupation can not be considered 
lucrative. The witnesses testified that petitioner believes in the principles 
underlying the Philippine Constitution. It was not shown, however, upon what did 
they base this belief and what these principles are.</p>
<p>Finding, therefore, that the decision appealed from is not in accordance with 
the law and jurisprudence on the matter, the same is hereby reversed, with costs 
against petitioner.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,
