				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from resolutions of the Court of Appeals setting aside its
original decision affirming the lower court's judgment and order­ing the remand
of the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case originated on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="4">April
 7, 1959</st1:date>, with the institution by petitioners as plaintiffs of an
action in the Court of First Ins­tance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Branch, against private respondent as defendant
for recovery of possession of a parcel of land with damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1959</st1:date>, the date
scheduled for trial with due notice to the, parties, respondent-defendant and
his counsel failed to appear and petitioners plaintiffs presented their
evidence <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court thereafter rendered its decision on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="8">Aug­ust 7, 1959</st1:date>, with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the defendant ANACLETO NAVARRO is hereby ordered to
remove the stone wail and 'chicken-cyclone' wire fence, from Lot No. 3 in
question, and to pay plaintiffs the sum of SEVEN HUNDRED (P700. 00) PESOS, as
attorney's fees, and the costs.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent-defendant failed to perfect an appeal from the said
decision and instead filed on <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="9">September
 10, 1959</st1:date>, a motion for relief from judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His counsel, Atty. Francisco Ventura, alleged
that he had mistakenly noted in his diary the date of trial to be July 22, 1959
instead of July 20, 1959, and that he realized his mistake in noting the date
of hearing only when he and res­pondent appeared in court on the later date for
the trial and were informed that it had been held two days before as
scheduled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1960</st1:date>, the trial court denied said
motion for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion for
reconsideration of such order having been likewise denied, respondent-defendant
perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals with the lone assignment of error
that the trial court had erred in denying his motion for relief from judg­ment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1965</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals, through its then Presiding Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Sanchez, promulgated its decision finding no merit in the appeal thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The lone error assigned in appellant's brief squarely
presents the issues as to whether or not the trial court acted within the law
in denying the motions for relief from judgment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For a motion of this nature to prosper, <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
must under oath: First, show fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence,
and second, state facts consisting his good and subs­tantial defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3, Rule 38, Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this context that we now examine
appellant's position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Appellant alleges mistake in having anno­tated in his diary the
date of trial to be <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1959</st1:date>,
instead of <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is this sufficient?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The affidavit in support of the motion states that on <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1959</st1:date>, defendant and his
counsel appeared in court; that they were informed by the court that the trial
was held on July 20; that counsel consulted his diary and discovered the
mistake; that he showed that mistake to the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances surrounding this alleged
negligence remain unconvincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first legal step by defendant to relieve himself from the effects of that
decision was taken on <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="9">September 10,
 1959</st1:date>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As early as <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1959</st1:date>, both defendant and
counsel knew that the trial proceeded as sche­duled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Theirs was the duty to move the Court
promptly thereafter to reopen the case to afford them an opportunity to test
plaintiffs' evidence and submit their own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant received
notice of the decision on <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="8">August 11,
 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, he waited
until <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1959</st1:date> to
move for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this move was
still within the 60-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, the
delay in fil­ing the same smacks of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and cast a
serious doubt upon the veracity of defendant's claim of excusable
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, if
we are to grant relief we would be establishing a precedent which would open
virtually the flood­gates to unmeritorious averments of excusable
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But, on the assumption that there was excusable negligence,
would the cry of fraud justify reopening of the case? Defendant's averment is
that the plaintiffs knowingly obtained title to the property without notifying
appellant who claims to be the owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon two grounds, this claim does not merit consideration:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. The land
registration proceedings under which plaintiffs obtained title to the property
is a proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice thereof pub­lished in the Official
Gazette binds the whole world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
matters not, as defendant avers, that he did not receive personal notice of the
application Per­sonal notice is not necessary to give the court
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice in the Official
Gazette 'To All Whom It May Concern' implies that the whole world are made
parties defendant; unknown claims are <span class="SpellE">foreclosed,thereby</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. The decree
of registration over the land in question was issued in plaintiffs' favor on
26th of April, 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs' <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title No. 1 covering this land was issued by the Commissioner of Land
Registration on <st1:date year="1955" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant's answer to the complaint was filed
as aforesaid on <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one-year period set forth in Section 38
of the Torrens Act had, by that time already elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The title had become indefeasible, no longer

pp. 4-7, Annex 'A' of the Petition for Certiorari).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision appealed
from with costs against the respondent-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this decision was sent by registered mail No. 87 on July
19, 1965 addressed to respondent's attorney of record, Fran­cisco Ventura, at
his address of record, 1589 <span class="SpellE">Mayhaligue</span>, The present
case before us arose at this juncture, for thereafter respondent's counsel of
record from its inception, Atty. Ventura, just faded from the scene and was no
longer heard from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With­out Atty.
Ventura having withdrawn as respondent's counsel of record, Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> of 304
Alliance Building, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1965</st1:date>, their appearance as
counsel for respondent-appellant in the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They sub­sequently filed a
"Manifestation and Motion" praying that they be furnished with a copy
of the appellate court's decision which was opposed by petitioners on the
ground that respondent's counsel of record, Atty. Ventura, had already been
validly served with copy of said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1965</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
however, granted the "Manifestation and Motion" of Attys. <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>, who
were served with copy of the decision on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said counsel then filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="12">December
 6, 1965</st1:date> a motion for reconsideration of the decision which was duly
opposed by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original division of the court that rendered the decision was
apparently split 2 to 1 for denial of the motion for reconsider­ation, and the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>, Justice <span class="SpellE">Sancheza</span>
was thereafter promoted as a member of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His successor, then Presiding Justice Fred
Ruiz Castro, now a distinguished member of this Court, issued on January 24,
1966, a special order appointing three asso­ciate justices to sit with the two
remaining <span class="SpellE">justicesin</span> a Special Division of Five<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to decide the said motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 25, 1966, the appellate court's Special Division of
Five issued its split resolution (3 to 2) granting the motion for
reconsideration, setting aside the decision of July 15, 1965 as well as the appealed
decision of the trial court, and remanding the case to the trial court for
further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in turn filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1966</st1:date> their motion for reconsideration of the
appellate court's resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="2">Feb­ruary
 25, 1966</st1:date> on the ground, among others, that the original decision
had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in August,
1965 before Attys. <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>
filed their motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1966</st1:date>,
the appellate court's Special Division of Five, by the same split vote, issued
its resolution denying petitioners' motion for recon­sideration, rejecting the
grounds adduced by them in support thereof as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"True it is that a copy of the decision was<span style="">&nbsp; </span> posted by registered mail on <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1965</st1:date>, to be sent to Atty.
Francisco Ventura at his registered address.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the latter was returned unclaimed and there is nothing in the record
to show when the notice to Atty. Francisco Ventura to receive said letter was
sent to him by the Postmaster of Manila. x <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. There is no
proof when the registry notice addressed to the original defendant-appellant's
coun­sel, Atty. Francisco Ventura, advising him to re­ceive the letter
containing the decision of July 15, 1965, was sent to him by the Postmaster of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough that a letter be sent by
registered mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is important is
that the addressee be notified and advised to receive it in order that ser­vice
may be deemed effective after the lapse of five days from the sending of the
first notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that a
notice was sent to Atty. Francisco Ventura, it must be shown that he received
it, or someone else of sufficient discretion did so for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the addressee is not notified as above
indicated it is not just that he be considered as having been served with
notice upon the expiration of five days from the sending of the first notice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When, on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1965</st1:date>, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>,
Jr. entered their appearance for the defendant-appellant, pre­sumably with the
consent of the latter, Atty. Fran­cisco Ventura was for good cause replaced by
his client because of failure to contact him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3) When this
Court by resolution of Sept­ember 9, 1965, ordered that copy f the decision of

<span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>,
Jr., notwithstanding plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
opposition, that action was practically an order approving the change of
attorney for defendant-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was done in the interest of justice so as not to permit the neglect,
inattention or irresponsible actions of an attorney to prejudice his client,
provided the latter is not chargeable with neglect in protecting his
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in the meantime had requested the appellate court's clerk
to request information from the Manila Postmaster as to the service of the
decision by registry mail to respondent's counsel of record, and the Manila
Postmaster had on July 30, 1966 replied to the clerk's inquiry that "(I)n
connection with your letter under date of July 11, 1966 concerning your regis­tered
letter No. 87 posted at Manila on July 20, 1965 and addressed to Atty.
Francisco Ventura, Manila, please be informed that according to our records,
said registered letter was returned to you as sender and was receipted for by
Mr. G. Reyes on Aug­ust 25, 1965, <u>because it was not called for by the
addressee des­pite the three notices sent to him on July 20, 30 and August 3,
1965</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners on <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="8">August 1,
 1966</st1:date> further filed a second motion for reconsideration with motion
for leave to file the same, aver­ring that with the postmaster's certification,
it was clear that three notices of the registered decision had been duly sent
to Atty. Ventura.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second motion was
admitted but denied by the appellate court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1966</st1:date> by the same
split-vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complaining that the appellate court thus decided a ques­tion of
substance in a way not in accord with law and with our applicable decisions,
petitioners sought a review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gave due
course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent having failed to file
his brief, the case was submitted for decision without respondent's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now rule for petitioners.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The key issue is whether or not service by registered mail of
the appellate court's decision upon respondent's counsel of record should be
deemed completed and effected upon the addressee's failure to claim his mail on
the fifth day after the first notice of the postmaster in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 13, Section 8 of the Rules of Court which read:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 8. <u>Completeness of Service</u> -- Personal service
is complete upon actual delivery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Service by ordinary mail is complete upon the expiration of five (5)
days after mailing, unless the court otherwise provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service by registered mail is completed upon
actual receipt by the addressee; but if he fails to claim his mail from the
post office within five (5) days from the date of first notice of the
postmaster, service shall take effect at the expiration of such time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that copy of the appellate court's deci­sion
of July 15, 1965, in accordance with the Manila postmaster's certification, was
posted at Manila by registered mail on July 19, 1965 addressed to Atty.
Ventura, respondent's counsel of record at his address of record, and that the
same was not called for by the addressee despite three notices sent to him on
July 20, 30 and August 3, 1965, so that it was returned to the appellate court
as sender on August-25, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
above-quoted rule, there­fore, service of the decision was deemed effected on
Atty. Ven­tura on July 26, 1965, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e. , at the
expiration of the fifth day after the postmaster's first notice to him on July
20, 1965, and the dec­ision became final 15 days thereafter on August 10, 1965,
in accord­ance with Rule 51, Sec. 10.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court's decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1965</st1:date> had thus become final on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1965</st1:date>, with service thereof
having been effected in law on respondent's counsel of record in accordance
with a long line of our applicable decisions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the latest case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Babala</u></span><u> vs.
Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court upheld the appellate court's decision throwing out therein
petitioner's appeal for fail­ure of his counsel to claim the registered notice
from the appel­late court requiring him to pay the docket fees and rejecting
his counsel's claim that the postmaster's notices were not turned over to him
by the recipient thereof, and reiterated the rule long familiar to
practitioners that "it is the duty of counsel to adopt and maintain a
system that efficiently takes into account all court notices sent to him.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the Court applying the for­mer rule, Rule 27, section 8 of the old Rules of
Court (now Rule 13, sec. 8), threw out therein appellant's contention that
failure to claim the registered notice merely amounted to an excusable neglect
which would warrant the reopening of the case, empha­sizing that:</p>

<blockquote>"It is such kind of neglect or inaction that gave life to the
provision that service by registered mail is complete and effective, if the addressee
fails to claim his mail from the post office within five days from the date of
first notice of the post­master, at the expiration of such time.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Grospe</u></span><u> vs.
Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
in further applying the rule as to which should prevail between the date of
notice and the date of subsequent actual receipt, ruled that when the addressee
fails to claim his mail from the Post Office within five days from the first
notice of the postmaster, the service shall take effect at the expiration of
such time, regardless of whether the addressee never claimed it or received it
afterwards:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Uera</span> failed to claim his mail <u>within
five days</u> from first notice (November 28, 1955); therefore, he is deemed to
have received it on December 3, 1955, no matter whether he never claimed it or
received it afterwards (as in this case, on Decem­ber 20, 1955).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have held in several cases, 'if the
addressee is so negligent that he fails to claim his mail from the post office
within five days after the first notice by the postmaster, then the service is
deemed complete and effective at the expiration of such time."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Where the addressee justly shows a valid reason for setting aside
the rule's presumption that he should have received the mail within the
five-day period from the postmaster's first notice, the Court has shunned a
rigid application that would work an injustice.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
But such is not the case here.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The corollary issue is whether or not the subsequent
"Appearance" in the appellate court on August 25, 1965 of Attys. <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> as
counsel for respondent (with ser­vice by mail of a copy thereof to petitioners'
counsel but with­out service to respondent's counsel of record, Atty. Ventura,
nor to respondent himself; and which "Appearance" does not contain the
conformity either of respondent or of Atty. Ventura; and with no notice of
withdrawal ever having been filed by Atty. Ventura), could serve as a valid
substitution of attorneys for respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our rule and jurisprudence on substitution of attorneys are clear that
unless the procedure prescribed by Rule 138, Section 26<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
is complied with, the attorney whose appearance is on record before the filing
of the application for substitution should be regarded as the attorney entitled
to be notified of all notices and pleadings and responsible for the conduct of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as the old case of <u>U.
S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and restated in <u>Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court has consistently held that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in order that there may be substitution of attorneys in a
given case, there must be (1) a written application for substi­tution; (2) a
written consent of the client; and) a written consent of the attorney to be
substituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in case the consent of
the attorney to be substituted cannot be obtained, there must at least be proof
that notice of the motion for substitution has been served upon him in the
manner prescribed by our rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless
this procedure is followed the attorney who appears to be on record before the
filing of the application for substitution should be re­garded as the attorney

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances of record, there was clearly no valid
substitution of attorneys for respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere unexplained disappearance from the scene and total silence of
the counsel of re­cord, Atty. Ventura, could not serve to set aside the service
in law upon him of the appellate court's decision of July 15, 1965, much less
to allow respondent to produce almost four months time -- from August 10, 1965
when the decision became final upon completion of legal service by registered
mail on Atty. Ventura to December 6, 1965, when Attys. <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> filed their motion for
reconsideration -- and obviously attempt Stretch thereby the 15-day period to
seek a reconsideration of the decision notwithstanding its finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the old case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Aznar</u></span><u> vs.
Norris</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court has held that the mere appearance of a second attorney on behalf of a
litigant does not authorize a presumption that the authority of the first
attorney of record has been withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Wack-Wack</u></span><u> Golf and Country Club,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court pointed out that even if the counsel-law firm of record has arranged
with its client for its impending relief from the case and its substitution by new
counsel, "it is under obligation to protect the client's interest (which
includes appearance at the hearing) until its final release from the
professional relationship with such client.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>For its part, the court could recognize no other representation on
behalf of the client except such counsel of record until a formal substitution
of attorney is effected</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, any
agree­ment or arrangement such counsel of record and its client may reach
regarding the presentation of the client's case in court is purely their
private concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceedings in court
cannot be made to depend on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lack of coordination or understand­ing between the two law firms in the instant
case cannot be consi­dered as a legal excuse or falling within the ambit of
excusable negligence to justify the granting of relief from the order declar­ing
the client in default or, as in this case, from a decision en­tered after
presentation of evidence in his absence."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="NUM">3. In the absence of any credible representation or mani­festation
on the record on the part of respondent nor of his counsel of record, it was
patent error for the appellate court to rule in its second resolution of July
11, 1966 that with the appearance on August 25, 1965 of Attys. <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> for
respon­dent, "presumably with the consent of the (respondent)",
"Atty. Francisco Ventura was for good cause replaced by his client because
of failure to contact him." Their absolute silence on this score repels
such a presumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No explanation
whatever is made by respondent, as to when he first learned of the decision or
whether he sought out his attorney of record and in fact failed to contact him,
as unjustifiably presumed by the appellate court, or if he did contact him,
what explanation in turn was given to him by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, Atty. Ventura, whom the appellate
court took note of as a busy practitioner and pre-bar reviewer in various
Manila law colleges, has not essayed to give any expla­nation whatever for his
failure to claim the registered copy of the decision, despite the three notices
sent to him by the Manila postmaster, but simply vanished from the case.
Petitioners in­dicate that respondent had made some unsubstantiated represen­tation
that Atty. Ventura had moved his office to a new address, but it is settled law
that counsel must notify the Court of any change of address<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
and that clients are bound by the errors and neglect of their counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4. The appellate court majority's reason that “(E)<span class="SpellE">ven</span> granting that a notice was sent to Atty. Francisco Ventura,
it must be shown that he received it, or someone else of sufficient discretion
did so for him” was likewise grave error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is contrary to the legal presumption "that a letter duly
directed and mailed was received in the regular course of the mail"<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
which, under the Rules, is "satisfactory, if <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>."
We have here the <span class="SpellE"><u>uncontradicted</u></span> certification
of the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> post­master that three notices of the
registered decision were sent to Atty. Ventura, but he did not call for
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Ventura as the addressee is
the only person who can dispute competently the postmaster's certification that
he was sent the said notices, but he chose to keep silent, and to throw
unrealistically on petitioners the burden of still showing that he did receive
said notices would be against all considerations of public policy and sound
adminis­tration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
even if Atty. Ventura had denied receiving the three notices -- and in fact, he
has not so denied --the Court has held that "(B)<span class="SpellE">etween</span>
the denial of a party and the assertion of an official whose duty it is to send
notices, the choice should not be difficult to make,"<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
reaffirming the criterion established in earlier cases that such denials cannot
prevail over the positive statement of the duly authorized postal official
which "is fortified by the legal presumption that official duty was
regularly performed."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5. The end result is that the appellate court's decision of <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1965</st1:date> is declared to have
become final on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1965</st1:date>,
pursuant to the provisions of Rule 13, Section 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the resolution of February

for further proceedings, as well as the subsequent resolutions of July 11, 1966
and August 11, 1966 "practically approving" the substitution of Atty.
Ventura by new counsel, could produce no legal effect, because they were beyond
the jurisdiction and authority of the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the finality of the decision,
there was no longer any pending case in the appellate court wherein
respondent's counsel of record would yet be substituted by new counsel.</p>
