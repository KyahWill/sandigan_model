				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the &nbsp;general elections of November 10, 1959, wherein Remegio &nbsp;Gabuya and &nbsp;Eutiquio Dajao &nbsp;ran as &nbsp;candidates for &nbsp;the position of Mayor of Dimiao, Bohol, &nbsp;Gabuya &nbsp;was proclaimed elected. &nbsp;&nbsp;Dajao &nbsp;filed a protest in the Court of First Instance &nbsp;of Bohol, which, after hearing, upheld the proclamation of the protestee and declared him elected by 733 votes against the protestant's 637 votes. &nbsp;The protestant took an appeal to the Court of Appeals, &nbsp;which court, in its decision of &nbsp;August 13, 1962 ruled and &nbsp;discounted as marked ballots 170 votes of the protestee appellee, reversed the &nbsp;decision &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> and &nbsp;declared the protestant-appellant &nbsp;the elected mayor of Dimiao, Bohol, with a plurality of 38 votes over his opponent. &nbsp;Protestee-appellee now comes to us by way of the present petition for review.  <p>Petitioner does not here question the finding by the Court of Appeals that all the 170 ballots &nbsp;in &nbsp;dispute were invariably voted for in this manner: &nbsp;The name of the candidate first voted for councilor was written with his surname prefixed &nbsp;by a nickname or what appears to be a derivative or contraction of his first or Christian name, while the rest &nbsp;of the candidates were voted for by their surnames or their surnames and initials of their respective first or Christian names. &nbsp;Thus, the candidate first voted for or whose name appears on the first space for councilors was written "Dan" Calihat, for Daniel; "Mat" for Mateo Acusar; "Greg" for &nbsp;Gregorio &nbsp;Pahang; "Tek", "Tik" or "Tic" for Eutiquio Idulzura; "Lu" for Luis Acorda; "Lus" or "Los" for Lucio Saluta; "Ped" &nbsp;for Pedro Lagura; &nbsp;"Panoy" for Galicano Idul; "Cleto" &nbsp;or "Clito" &nbsp;for Anacleto Palaca; and "Masoy" for Damaso Lagumbay. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is claimed, however, that the Court of Appeals, in concluding from the &nbsp;aforestated manner that the same was made for the purpose of identification, and in declaring the 170 ballots all &nbsp;marked, committed an erroneous conclusion &nbsp;of &nbsp;law. Indeed, involved in this case is the sole issue of whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in holding as marked and, consequently, deductible from the total &nbsp; number of votes counted for herein petitioner, &nbsp;the 170 &nbsp;ballots &nbsp;voted for in the manner above indicated.</p> <p>In support of his contention, &nbsp;disputing &nbsp;the ruling of the Court of Appeals, petitioner relies on the &nbsp;case of Amurao <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Calangi,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; wherein this &nbsp;Court, rejecting another Court of Appeals decision holding that the writing of the name of the candidate twice gives rise to the suspicion that it was a &nbsp;design to mark the ballot, held &nbsp;that &nbsp;such fact does not invalidate the ballot but makes of the vote for the office of which &nbsp;he is not a candidate, stray. &nbsp;The foregoing ruling was made in view of the &nbsp;absence of evidence showing that &nbsp;the repetition of the &nbsp;names of the candidates was made for the &nbsp; purpose of &nbsp;identifying the ballots. &nbsp;In &nbsp;other words, &nbsp;the determinative &nbsp; factor in the nullification &nbsp;of ballots &nbsp;for being marked &nbsp;as following &nbsp;a design &nbsp;or pattern, &nbsp;is &nbsp;the existence &nbsp;of &nbsp;evidence &nbsp;<i>aliunde</i> tending to show the intention or purpose in the use of the contested manner or means of voting, which &nbsp;is to identify the ballots. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p> <p>True &nbsp;it is &nbsp;that under &nbsp;Section 149(9) of the &nbsp;Revised Election Code, the use of nicknames and &nbsp;appellations of affection and &nbsp;friendship, if accompanied by the name or surname of &nbsp;the candidate, does not annul such vote. &nbsp;&nbsp;The rule, &nbsp;however, is predicated on the <i>proviso</i> that the same is not &nbsp;used as &nbsp;a &nbsp;means to identify its voter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>But in this &nbsp;case, there &nbsp;is precisely such evidence &nbsp;found by the Court of Appeals, which finding is binding on this Court.</p> <p>Thus the Court &nbsp;of Appeals in the &nbsp;instant &nbsp;case, &nbsp;said: </p> <blockquote> <p>"* * *. It &nbsp;is a fact that a common pattern was adopted in filling &nbsp;up &nbsp;all the ballots &nbsp;under &nbsp;consideration. &nbsp;This circumstance <i>lends &nbsp;credibility to &nbsp; the evidence presented &nbsp;by protestant to &nbsp;the effect that sample ballots prepared in the manner these ballots under consideration were &nbsp;filled up were distributed by the protestee and his leaders and &nbsp;that instructions were given to the voters to follow said sample ballots which contain countersigns.</i> &nbsp;For &nbsp;this &nbsp;reason, these 170 (not 174 as claimed by protestant) ballots should be as they are hereby declared invalid as marked ballots." (Italics supplied.) </p> </blockquote> <p>It is evident therefrom that in arriving at the conclusion that &nbsp; the 170 &nbsp;ballots in dispute are &nbsp;marked, the Court of Appeals took &nbsp;into account not only &nbsp;the manner by &nbsp;which the &nbsp;said &nbsp;ballots were filled, but also the evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">aliunde</span> presented by the protestant-respondent tending to establish that such manner &nbsp;of voting was &nbsp;planned to identify the votes of certain &nbsp;voters or groups of voters, &nbsp;in violation of the provisions of &nbsp;the Election Law.</p> <p>In view of the foregoing, and finding no reason to disturb the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to be reviewed, the same is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, &nbsp;with costs against petitioner. &nbsp;&nbsp;So ordered.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C.
