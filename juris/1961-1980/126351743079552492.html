				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals reversing that of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental and de­claring
Socorro T. <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> entitled to Stalls Nos. 236, 237
and 238 of the central market of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, with costs against <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Cornelio.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background is set forth in said decision of the Court
of Appeals, from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that plaintiff Socorro T. <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
occupied a 32-square meter stall, situated in the sari-sari section of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City Central Market before and during the war and
until the said market was burned on <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Cor­nelio was, before the war and until fire des­troyed
the aforementioned market, a lessee of a block in the main building, and
another make-shift stall of 3 square meters used as sari-sari store and
admittedly occupied and personally tended by <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
common law husband <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Chai</span>
Tan, a Chinese national.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the fire gutted the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
Central Market on <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1955</st1:date>,
plaintiff resumed her former place in the burned market by rebuilding her
stalls therein, which was subsequently demo­lished to give way to the
construction of a new Central Market.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants Cornelio and <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Chai</span>
Tan on the other hand transferred their sari-sari store to <span class="SpellE">Luzurriaga</span>-Smith
streets, and admittedly <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Chai</span>
Tan occupied and tended this sari-sari store while <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Cornelio attended to her <span class="SpellE"><u>carinderia</u></span> business
and in the administration of her two commercial buildings, one at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> street and another in front of the Central Market,
both at <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the reconstruction of the Central Market, the City
Council of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> passed a series of ordinances,
namely, Ordinance Nos. 1 and 2, series of 1959, enacted on July 8, 1958 and
Ordinance No. 18, series of 1959, enacted on August 1, 1958 (Exhibit 7), the
latter ordinance amending, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, Section 1 of
Ordinance No. 2, by providing that the Market Committee shall be composed of
(a) City Treasurer as Chairman, (b) a representative of the Mayor, (c) a
representative of the Secretary of Fin­ance, (d) a representative of the City
Fiscal, (e) a representative of the City Council, and (f) a repre­sentative of
the market vendors as members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
ordinance Nos. 2 and 18 provided that all applications in triplicate shall be
filed with the City Treasurer not later than <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records reveal that on <st1:date year="1958" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1958</st1:date>,
plaintiff Socorro <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> filed her application for
Stalls Nos. 342, 343 and 344 of the grocery and sari-sari section, while de­fendant
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Cornelio filed her application for stalls
Nos. 321, 322 and 323 of the dry goods section. (Exhibit 11).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 11, 1958, the Market Committee awarded to plaintiff
stalls Nos. 236, 237 and 238, together with 64 other applicants, which were
awarded the other stalls in the same section com­prising stalls Nos. 225 to 246
and 375 to 382 - be­longing to the reserve section and which were classi­fied
by the Committee and awarded to applicants in the sari-sari section (Exhibit
B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently or on <st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1958</st1:date>, the City Treasurer
formally in­formed plaintiff of the award of the aforementioned stalls 236 to
238, advising her to report imme­diately to the Market Superintendent to take
pos­session of the stalls (Exhibit L).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff took possession thereof and introduced improvements thereon
and regularly paid the rentals <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> (Exhibit V).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, it has been established that defendant
Cornelio, upon learning of the award of the stalls in question to plaintiff,
went to the City Hall and verbally protested said award to the Market Committee
and filed her written protest on August 23, 1958 (Exhibit 12-Tambasen; 5­-Cornelio).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="8">August
 25, 1958</st1:date>, the Market Com­mittee met to discuss the petition of
defendant for a reconsideration of the award made to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>, and during the deliberation Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ilde­fonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Coscolluela</span>, Jr., a
member thereof re­marked:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'With regards to the reconsider­ation sought by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Cor­nelio, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nessi</span>,
I would like to inform you that at the time of the filing of ap­plication, Mrs.
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Cornelio filed her application in the Dry
Goods Section and that in the distribution of the Sari-Sari Section applicants,
she was not given preference in view of her application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regards to her alle­gation that at that
time she did not apply for stalls Nos. 236, 237 and 238 because it was
reserved, I would like to inform you that no one had applied for the said
stalls, but after the sari-sari section was already exhausted, we got the re­served
sections and allocate to those applicants who had applied for sari-sari
section, hence the said stalls were awarded to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, to give her justice, we offered her
stalls in the dry good section and also in the sari-sari section but she
rejected the offer.'</p>

<blockquote>The Committee then compromised to give
defendant Cornelio 'stalls if the space between the stalls and blocks building
will be open to public vendors, which the Attorney for the petitioner
(defendant herein) also agreed' (Exhibit 13-Tambasen).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on September 9, 1958, when Cornelio
thru counsel, lodged her formal protest with the Department of Finance not
based on composition of Committee (Exhibit 7-Cornelio); and in his 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated February 6, 1959, the Secretary of
Finance declared that the awards made by the Market Committee on August 7 and
11, 1958, could not be considered as having been rendered by a duly constituted
committee under the provisions of Department Order No. 22, as amended, because
the market vendors were not represented in said committee (Exhibit 9
-Cornelio).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">indorse­ment</span>
was further clarified when in his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated May 28, 1959, the Secretary of Finance referred to the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City the request of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>,
and stating therein that the 'awarding of the market stalls as shown in the
minutes dated August 7 and 11, 1958 of the supposed Market Committee of that
City has been declared without force and effect as the said Committee, not
having been regularly constituted and incomplete, as required by Department
Order No. 32 of this Department, is without legal auth­ority to hold session.'
(Exhibit 15-Tambasen; 10 -Cornelio).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequently, the Secretary of Finance acting on the petition
of Socorro <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> for a reconsideration of the
ruling declaring the awards made on August 7 and 11, 1958 without force and effect,
denied the same in his 5th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> of July 5,
1960, and directed the Market Committee to take appropriate steps to allocate
or assign to Mrs. Cornelio the same number of stalls in the Sari-Sari Section
of the reconstructed market of the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
(Exhibit 11-Cornelio; Exhibit 12-Tambasen).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting on the 5th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> of the Department of Finance, the Market
Committee met on <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1960</st1:date>,
and approved the award of stalls Nos. 236, 237 and 1/2 of 238 to defendant <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Cornelio and 1/2 of Stall No. 238 and Stalls
Nos. 239 and 240 to plaintiff Socorro <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
(Exhibit F).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After considering
plaintiff's manifestations protesting said award and the comments of the City
Treas­urer, the Secretary of Finance in his 12th <span class="SpellE">Indorse­ment</span>
of <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1960</st1:date>,
affirmed the assign­ment of the stalls in question thus made by the Market
Committee in its meeting of <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="8">August 9,
 1960</st1:date> (Exhibit 12-Cornelio).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that the award of stalls Nos. 239 and 240 to
herein plaintiff, could not be imple­mented because the former is in the
possession of <span class="SpellE">Falconera</span> Cortez while the latter is
the subject of controversy between Jose <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> and
Rosario <span class="SpellE">Llander</span> (Exhibit 3-Cornelio and Exhibit
C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its meeting of December 16, 1960,
the Market Com­mittee was informed by the City Treasurer that he could not
implement the awards made of the stalls in question because of the
aforementioned fact that stalls Nos. 239 and 240 are occupied by Cortez and <span class="SpellE">Llander</span>, and it was agreed that the papers on said case be
returned to the Secretary of Finance (Exhibit 3-Cornelio).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing on record to show, however,
that said papers were returned to the Department of Finance."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> filed
Civil Case 5986 of said court of first instance - which is the case at bar -
against the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, the members of its
Market Committee, and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Cornelio and her
alleged husband, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Chai</span>
Tan, to enforce the award of Stalls Nos. 236, 237 and 238, made in 1958, in
favor of said <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, or on January 24, 1961,
Cornelio, in turn, commenced Civil Case No. 6021, of the same court, for
mandamus, against the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, its mayor and
its treasurer, to compel them to deliver Stalls Nos. 236, 237 and half of No.
238 to Cornelio, in accordance with the award made on August 9, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both cases were assigned to Branch I of said
court, presided over by Hon. Francisco Arellano, Judge. <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
sought to intervene in case No. 6021, but her motion was denied, upon the
ground that it would unduly delay the disposition of the case and that, at any
rate, her rights would be duly protected in Case No. 5986.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judgment having been rendered in favor of Cornelio, in Case No.
6021, on April 7, 1961, the city treasurer tried to place her in possession of
Stalls Nos. 236, 237 and half of No. 238, by directing <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
to make those stalls available for occupancy by Cornelio on or before April 13,
1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
applied for a writ of preliminary injunction, in Case No. 5986, to restrain the
defendants therein from ejecting her (<span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>) from
said stalls, and tried to appeal from the decision in Case No. 6021; but, Judge
Arellano denied her motion for a writ of preliminary injunction in Case No.
5986 and disapproved the Record on Appeal, the notice of appeal and the appeal
bond filed by her in Case No. 6021, as well as caused the corresponding writ of
execution to issue therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of the orders to this effect having been
denied, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> filed Case CA-G. R. No. 29283-R of
the Court of Appeals, for certiorari and mandamus with preliminary in­junction,
against Judge Arellano, the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, its City
Treasurer, the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental and "the spouses <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Chai</span> Tan and <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Cornelio", to annul said orders and to compel Judge Arellano to allow <span class="SpellE">Magbanua's</span> inter­vention in Case No. 6021.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, the Court of Appeals rendered
a decision, on October 7, 1961, upholding Judge Arellano' s refusal to give due
course to <span class="SpellE">Magbanua's</span> appeal in Case No. 6021, but
declaring that he had erred in denying the motion for a writ of preliminary
injunction in Case No. 5986 and in issuing the afore­mentioned writ of
execution in Case No. 6021, and, accordingly, enjoining the respondents
permanently from enforcing and execut­ing the judgment therein rendered,
pending final disposition of Civil Case No. 5986.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1963</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered in said Civil Case No. 5986, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1) dismissing the case against the de­fendants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) declaring that defendant <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Cornelio is entitled to the possession of stalls Nos. 236, 237 and 1/2 of 238
at the public market of the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) ordering the plaintiff to vacate the same; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4) if the defendants desire to use the im­provements made by the
plaintiff upon the property, they should pay the plaintiff the sum of Five Hun­dred
Pesos (P500.00), otherwise the plaintiff may remove the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without special pronouncement as to
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed from this decision to the Court of Appeals,
which reversed it and declared <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
"entitled to Stalls Nos. 236, 237 and 238", with the "costs
against x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Cor­nelio."
Such decision is the object of the present petition for review on certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that the award of Stalls Nos. 236, 237 and
238, made by the Market Committee, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>,
on August 11, 1958, had been declared by the Secretary of Finance, on February
6, 1959, to be "without force and effect", upon the ground that the
Committee was, on the date first mentioned, irregularly constituted and
incomplete, because the market vendors were not represented therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals found this action of the
Secretary of Finance untenable, for the reason that the Market Committee
established by ordinances of the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> con­sisted
of six members all of whom, except the representative of the market vendors -
that is to say, five members - attended the meeting of the Committee, on August
11, 1958; that said present members constituted a quorum and were competent to
transact business, as well as to make the aforementioned award; that the
absence of a representative of the market vendors at said meeting was due to
their failure to agree on the person who would repre­sent them; and that the
Committee was not supposed to be immo­bilized in the meanwhile.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
did not appeal from or seek a review of the action taken by the Secretary of
Finance on <st1:date year="1959" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> could have
appealed from said action to the President,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
but she did not do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she felt that
the Secretary of Finance had acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion, she could have had it annulled by com­petent court in a special
civil action for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did
she apply for such relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
the matter of allocating the stalls in dispute was remanded to the Market
Committee, which, after making an <span class="SpellE">occular</span> inspection,
decided, in its meeting of August 9, 1960, to award Stalls Nos. 236, 237 and
half of No. 238 to Cornelio, and the other half thereof, in addition to Stalls
Nos. 239 and 240, to <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> moved for
a reconsideration of these awards, but the motion was denied and the awards
were, on <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1960</st1:date>,
affirmed by the Secretary of Finance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once again, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> did not ask a
reconsideration of this act of the Secretary of Finance, or appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to a higher authority, or seek its annulment by
writ of certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence,
the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the second award by the Secretary
of Finance must be deemed to have settled the matter of allocation of the
stalls in question and become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, the merits thereof - that is to say, the wisdom of the action
thus taken by the Secretary of Finance - may not be indirectly reviewed by
courts of justice in an ordinary action, such as the one at bar, for the
enforcement of the first award.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, even if this were a special civil action for
certiorari to annul the approval given by the Secretary of Finance to the
second award - which it is not - <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> may not be
granted such relief: (1) because the Secretary of Finance, who is indispensable
therefor,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> is
not a party in the present case; (2) because it is not disputed that he had
jurisdiction to act on the second award; and (3) because, in affirming such
award, there had been no abuse of discretion on the part of said officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the records show that the questioned action of the Secretary
of Finance mainly sought to do justice to both parties; that Cornelio was not
even considered by the Market Committee in making its first award; that this
was due to a purely technical ground, namely, that she had not applied for
stalls in the <u>sari-sari</u> section; that this ground is untenable, inasmuch
as the stalls in question (Nos. 236 to 240) were not in the <u>sari-sari</u>
section, but in a "<u>reserved</u>" one; that the Secretary of
Finance set aside the first award in order to give Cornelio a <u>chance to participate</u>
in the award of stalls in said reserved section, for, like <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>,
she was a former holder of <u>sari-sari</u> stalls; that, before making its
second award, the Market Committee made an <span class="SpellE">occular</span>
inspection for the purpose of ascertaining the location of the stalls held by
the parties, before the destruction of the old market by fire, in relation to
the market stalls in the new market to be the object of the second award; that
said Committee awarded Stalls Nos. 236, 237 and half of No. 238 to Cornelio, upon
the theory that they are the stalls nearest to the location of her <u>sari-sari</u>
stalls in the old market, prior to its destruction; and that there is nothing
to indi­cate that this finding of fact of the Market Committee - which was
impliedly affirmed by the Secretary of Finance - does not conform substantially
to the objective truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the Secretary of Finance has not abused his
discretion, much less exceeded his jurisdiction, in affirming the second award.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have not overlooked the statement, made in the deci­sion of
the Court of Appeals, to the effect that the award for Stalls Nos. 239 and 240
to <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> could not be implemented, because the
former is "in the possession of <span class="SpellE">Falconera</span> Cortez
while the latter is the subject of a controversy between Jose <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> and Rosario <span class="SpellE">Llander</span>."
This circumstance does not detract, however, from the validity of the second
award in favor of Cornelio or of the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
thereof by the Secretary of Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
proper relief for <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> is to demand compliance by
the proper authorities with the second award in her favor, and, should they
fail to do so, to seek the cor­responding relief from the courts of justice, as
Cornelio did in Civil Case No. 6021.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals should be,
as it is hereby reversed, and another one shall be entered affirming that of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental,
