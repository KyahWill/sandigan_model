<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1977</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">The factual and procedural antecedents of this petition

from 2 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. then sudden exposure to outside element after work
like rain, <span class="SpellE">floody</span> streets from premises, etc."
Respondent company filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="6">June 6,

she was also exposed to sudden change of temperature"; and that "(U)<span class="SpellE">nder</span> section 15 of the Act, the claimant is entitled to

<p class="BODY">Claimant, herein petitioner, filed a "Motion for Execution

dated March 23, 1976, of Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Llobrera</span>, it appears that herein petitioner was directly
paid by the Company "... the sum of P3,261.12 corresponding to what was
due up to October 2, 1975," … for which reason there is no further need to
enforce the writ.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It appears also that respondent Company failed to make the additional payments.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1977</st1:date>,
petitioner moved to enforce weekly payments of award with the Compensation
Appeals and Review Staff, Department, now Ministry of Labor, to which effective
<st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1976</st1:date>, workmen's

Again, on April 19, 1977, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> D. de Luna,
counsel for herein petitioner, also wrote a letter to the Employee's
Compensation Commission (ECC) requesting for "favorable action" on
petitioner's claim for additional weekly payments of award.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The same was referred by ECC Executive Director E.M. <span class="SpellE">Cayapas</span>
thru a first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1977</st1:date> to the Compensation Appeals and
Review Staff of the Ministry of Labor for appropriate action.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 7, 1977, then Acting Secretary, now Deputy Minister of
Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
issued an "Order"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
holding that "...claimant is no longer entitled to further weekly compensation"
for the reason that "... the latest x-ray examinations taken on September
23, 1975 reveals . . . that claimant's illness has already been cured or
arrested." Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the same on <st1:date year="1977" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1977</st1:date>, alleging, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the decision has already become
final and in fact has been partially executed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1977</st1:date>,
however, the then Secretary, now Minister, of Labor, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span> denied the said Motion for Reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition is clearly invested with merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor General pointed out, the
decision dated <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="10">Oct. 2, 1975</st1:date>
of Acting Referee <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and has in fact been partly executed and,
therefore, the same can no longer be disturbed or modified, whether directly or
indirectly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned order dated
July 7, 1977 denying petitioner's claim for additional compensation and in
effect setting aside said decision, was issued in excess of and/or with grave
abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule well-settled in our jurisdiction to the effect that in
workmen's compensation cases the referee's decision which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> can no longer be modified or set aside<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice
namely that at the risk of occasional error, the judgment of courts and award
of quasi-judicial agencies must become final at some definite date fixed by
law.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as the Solicitor General also observed, respondent
employer having refused or failed to pay the weekly compensation, petitioner
can now rightfully claim the entire balance of the disability compensation due
her at one time, pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 22, Workmen's
Compensation Act as amended.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Per her own admission, she has already received the sum of P3,261.12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subtracting this from P6,000.00, the total
entitlement, she is entitled to receive the balance or P2,738.88.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is also entitled to interest on
the said amount at the rate of 12% from <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="2">February
 10, 1977</st1:date>, the date she made her demand on respondent employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>
