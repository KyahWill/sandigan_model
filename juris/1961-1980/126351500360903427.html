order of the Court of</span> <span style="">first instance
of La Union, in its Civil Case No. 1990, granting a motion to dismiss the
complain for legal redemption by a co-owner (<span class="SpellE"><u>retracto</u></span>
</span><u><span style="">legal</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">de</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>comuneros</u></span>) on account of failure to state a cause of
action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The basic facts and
issues are stated in the decision appealed from, follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff based her complaint for legal redemption on a claim
that she is a co-owner of lot No. 802, for having purchased 1/3 portion
thereof, containing an area of 640 square meters as evidenced by a deed of
sale, Annex "A", which was executed on October 28, 1961 by <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> Perez de <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span>, one
of the co-owners, in her favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, the defendant, who on December 30, 1959 acquired
the other 2/3 portion of Lot No. 802 from <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aqui­tania</span> and her children, claimed that the plaintiff
bought the 1/3 southeastern portion, which is definitely identified and,
segregate hence there existed no co-ownership at the time and after said
plaintiff bought the aforesaid portion, upon which right of legal redemption can
be exercised or taken advantage of.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the complaint, it would appear that Lot No. 802 of the
Cadastral survey of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Rosario</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">,</span> covered by original certificate of title No. RO-2720 (N.A.<span class="GramE">),</span> was originally owned by the late spouses <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> Perez and <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> Bernal,
who were survived by her child namely, Crispin Perez, Lorenzo Perez and Ricardo
Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo Perez is also now
dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1951" day="28" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 28, 1951</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aquitania</span></span><span style=""> sold
her right and participation in Lot No. 802 consisting of 1/3 portion with an
area of 640 square meters to Leonora <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span> (Annex
of the complaint).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 29, 1951,
Lorenzo Perez, <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> Perez and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
</span>P. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Posadas</span></span><span style="">, widow of her deceased husband, Ricardo
Perez, for herself and in behalf of her <span class="GramE">minor</span>
children, <span class="SpellE">Gumersendo</span>, Raquel, Emilio a and Ricardo.
Jr<span class="GramE">.,</span> executed a deed of extrajudicial settlement
wherein Lorenzo Perez, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>
and her minor children assigned all their right, interest and participation in
lot No. 802 to <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> Perez (Annex B of the com</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">laint).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 30, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Cris<span style="">p</span>ina</span> Perez and her children,
Rosita <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span> <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">M</span><span style="">isa</span></span><span style="">, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span>, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span> and Aurora <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span>
sold to Elena <span class="SpellE">Pajimula</span>, the remaining 2/3 western
portion of Lot No. 802 with an area of 958 square meters (Annex C of the
complaint).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The action of the <span style="">p</span>laintiff
is premised on the claim of co-ownership.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the deed of sale executed in favor of the plaintiff, it can be seen
that the 1/3 portion sold to plaintiff is definitely identified as the 1/3
portion located on the south­eastern part of Lot No. 802 and s<span style="">p</span>ecifically bounded on the north by De
Guzman Street, on the east by <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> street, on the
sought by Perez street, and on the west by remaining portion of the same lot,
which contained an area of 640 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in the deed of sale executed b<span style="">y</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cris<span style="">p</span>ina</span>
Perez and her children in favor of defendant Elena <span class="SpellE">Pajimula</span>
over the remaining 2/3 portion of Lot No. 802, said portion is identified as
the western portion of <span style="">Lot No. 802
which is bounded on the north by Dc Guzman street, on the east by properties of
<span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span>, on the
sought b</span><span style="">y</span><span style=""> the nation­al mad and on the west by Lots
Nos. 799 and 801, containing an area of 958 s</span><span style="">q</span><span style="">uare meters.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant's </span><span style="">stand is </span><span style="">that the deed </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">her favor was ino</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">erative
to convey the southeastern third of Lot 802 of the Rosario Cadastre
notwithstanding the description in the deed itself, for the reason that the
vendor bein</span><span style="">g</span><span style=""> a mere co-owner, had no right to sell any
definite portion of the land held in common but could only transmit her
undivided share, since the s</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">ecific portion corresponding to the selling
co-owner is not known until partition takes place (Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>, 5 Phil. 567; Ramirez vs. Bautista 1</span><span style="">4</span><span style="">
Phil. 528).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">from</span>
this </span><span style="">p</span><span style="">remise, the appellant argues that the sale in
her favor, although describing a definite area, should be construed as having
conveyed only the undivided 1/3 interest in </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 802 owned at the time b</span><span style="">y</span><span style="">
the vendor, <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> Perez <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, when the next day said vendor
acquired the 2/3 interest of her two other co-owners, </span><st1:place><span style="">Lot</span></st1:place><span style=""> 802 became the common pro</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">erty
of <span class="SpellE">appelant</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cris<span style="">p</span>ina</span> Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, a</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">pellant argues, when <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> </span><span style="">old </span><span style="">the rest of the property to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajimula</span> s</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">ouses,
the former was selling</span><span style=""> an
undivided 2 /3 that appellant, as co-owner was entitled to redeem, pursuant</span><span style=""> to Article 1620 of the New </span><span style="">C</span><span style="">ivil
Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1620.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A co-owner
of a thing may exercise the right of redemption in case the shares of all the
other <span style="">co-owners or of arty of <span class="GramE">them,</span> are sold to a third person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the price of the alienation is grossly
excessive the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> shall pay only a
reasonable one.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Should two or more co-owners desire to exercise the right of
redemption, they may only do so in proportion to the share they may
respectively have in the thing owned in common.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court, upon
motion of defendant, dismissed the complaint, holding that the deeds of sale
show that the lot acquired by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span> was
different from that of the defendants <span class="SpellE">Pajimula</span>; hence
they never became co-owners, and the alleged right of legal redemption was not
proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estoque</span>
appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find no error in the
order of dismissal, for the facts pleaded negate the claim that appellant <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span> ever became a co-owner of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pajimula</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">(1) The deed of sale to <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span> (Annex A
of the complaint) clearly specifies the object sold as the southeastern third
portion of lot 802 of the Rosario Cadastre, with an area of 840 square meters,
more or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting that the seller, <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> Perez <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Aquitania</span> could not have sold this particular portion of
the lot owned in common by her and her two brothers, Lorenzo and Ricardo Perez,
by no means does it follow that she intended to sell to appellant <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span> her 1/3 undivided interest in the lot aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the deed of sale to
justify such inference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the seller
could have validly sold her one-third undivided interest to appellant is no
proof that she did choose to sell the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>Ab</u></span></span><span class="GramE"> <u>posse</u> <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>actu</u></span> <u>non</u>
<u>vale</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>illatio</u></span>.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">(2) While on the date of the sale to <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span>
(Annex A) said contract may have been ineffective, for lack of power in the
vendor to sell the spec portion described in the deed, the transaction was
validated and became fully effective when the next day (October 29, 1951) the
vendor, <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> Perez, acquired the entire interest
of bar remaining co-owners (Annex B) and there became the sole owner of Lot No.
802 of the Rosario Cadastral survey (<span class="SpellE">Llace</span>, vs. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, 12 Phil. 328).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 1434 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
clearly prescribes that -</p>

<blockquote>"When a person who is not the owner of <span style="">a </span>thing sells or alienates and delivers it, and later the seller
or grantor acquires title thereto such title passes by operation of law to the
buyer or grantee."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to this rule,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span> became the actual owner of <u>southeastern</u>
third of lot 802 on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="29" month="10"><span style="">October 29, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Wherefore, she never acquired an undivided interest in lot 802.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">And </span><span style="">when
eight years later <span class="SpellE">Cris</span> Perez sold to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajimula</span> the <u>western</u>
two-thirds of the same lot appellant did not acquire a right to redeem the
property thus sold, since the respective portions were distinct and separate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">IN VIEW OF THE
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="">, the appealed
order of dismissal is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellant <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
