				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a Judgment of conviction for the murder of <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span> Martinez, appellants <span class="SpellE">Senando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
having been found guilty as principals, the former sentenced to suffer the
penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, and the
latter to suffer an indeterminate sentence of from, ten (10) years and one (1)
day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> as minimum, to
eighteen (18) years, two (2) months and twenty-one (21) days of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> as maximum, and appellants <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Roberto Flores as accomplices on whom were
imposed respectively the indeterminate penalty of from six (6) years and one
(1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> as minimum to
twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as maximum

as minimum, to six (6) years and one (I) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> as maximum for appellant Flores, he being entitled to the
privileged mitigating circumstance of minority being only sixteen years of age
at the time of the commission of the offense, with each and everyone of the
above appellants being likewise sentenced to indemnify jointly and severally
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000.00 and with each one being
liable for one fourth of the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the death of <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span>
Martinez being due to acute hemorrhage arising from the multiple wounds
sustained by the injuries consisting of a total of nineteen wounds, seven
located on the head, ten on the right upper extremity, one on the lower
extremity, and one on the back with fractures on the skull, right arm and legs,
as well as contusions and abrasions on the left upper arm and the back.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is indisputable likewise that what subsequently became a
guilty tragedy had its origin in a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> owned by
the de­ceased, <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span> Martinez, having been gored
by 2 <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, belonging to one <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Prado</span>, which was then being tended by appellant
Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, with consequent damage to a
portion of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop of former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incident took place on <st1:date year="1959" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1959</st1:date> in Barrio San
Pedro, <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>, Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter
was sought to be settled by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, barrio
lieutenant of San Pedro, who, on November 17, 1959, drafted a document entitled
<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
pursuant to which Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> promised to lend
his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to Martinez while the injury lasted and
also to pay him one (1) <span class="SpellE">cavan</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
after harvest to compensate him for the loss of a portion of his crop.</p>

<p class="BODY">It likewise appeared that it was not until November 24th that <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span> Martinez could get hold of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
owned by Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to return it that afternoon of the
same day, but there was no one in the house of <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
to receive it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He brought it instead to
the barrio lieutenant, <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, and left it under his
care for the night, promising to return in the morning expecting Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, one of the appellants, to meet him
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a misinterpretation of
such failure of the deceased to return <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> on
November 24th, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
thinking that in violation of the agreement, <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
deliberately hid the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the lower court as to the particulars pre­ceding
the fatal encounter could be briefly summarized thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At past noon, the next day, November 25th at
the yard of the barrio lieutenant, <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> who was unarmed, <span class="SpellE">Senando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, another appellant, and Samson, each of
whom was armed with a bolo, and Roberto Flores, the last of the accused
appellants, who was holding a scythe and a piece of wood, were gathered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the wife and daughter
respectively of the barrio lieutenant, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganao</span> and Milagros <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, were in
the house, having returned from harvesting <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, the
wife then finishing her lunch while the daughter, who had just finished eating,
was sitting at the balcony reading comics.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants at the time were sitting on a pile of wood in the yard, about
17 meters away from the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deceased, <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span> Martinez, soon made his
appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He inquired from <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gagnao</span>, who was then by
the kitchen window, whether the barrio lieutenant was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receiving a negative answer, he went to
the place where the four appellants were seated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the killing as accepted by the lower court could
be summed up thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four appellants
stood up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> talked to <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>,
while his three co-appellants surrounded the latter in a semi-circle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They con­versed briefly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
was heard be Milagros <span class="SpellE">Lida</span> saying in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE"><u>Gindala</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">diri</span> <span class="SpellE">para</span> <span class="SpellE">maayos</span>
sang <span class="SpellE">mahusay</span></u>", which means "I brought
it here so that the matter may be settled amicably".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without further ado, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> suddenly hit <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
on the face and knocked him down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
Roberto Flores, kicked him on the legs as a result of which <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
"was placed in a lying position face upwards." From behind, Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> hacked him on the nape with a bolo while almost
simultaneously, <span class="SpellE">Senando</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
struck him with his bolo on his right knee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Roberto Flores followed suit by clubbing the victim several times with a
piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Samson and <span class="SpellE">Senando</span> continued the assault with their sharp <span class="SpellE">boloes</span> as he lay helpless on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the gory incident, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> was heard shouting in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
"<span class="SpellE">Sigue</span>, Samson, <span class="SpellE">patia</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>! <span class="SpellE">Patia</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was testimony to the effect that Milagros <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, filled with a deep sense of pity at seeing Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> still continuing with his bolo thrusts on the
defenseless victim, shouted from the balcony "<u>Samson, tama <span class="SpellE">na</span>, <span class="SpellE">kaawa-awa</span> <span class="SpellE">naman</span>
<span class="SpellE">si</span> <span class="SpellE">Manong</span> Making</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Samson did pause for a while and glanced at the frightened Milagros, advancing towards
her with upraised bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She promptly ran
inside the house and bolted the door after her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was met at the door by her mother, who likewise saw what happened,
from her vantage point at their kitchen window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> was by no means through; he
did use his bolo again on the prostrate body of <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only then, in the company of the other three
appellants, did he leave the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their brief as appellants, the antecedents leading to the
death of <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span> Martinez were set forth thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00
 a.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1949</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> went to the house of the barrio lieutenant,
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, to find out why <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
brought their <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to the said barrio
lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Samson also
arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gagnao</span> and Milagros <span class="SpellE">Lida</span> left their house to harvest <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The barrio lieutenant also left to look for
Martinez, while <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>, Samson and <span class="SpellE">Aladino</span> <span class="SpellE">Badi</span>, who was called by
the barrio lieutenant to entertain the two, seated themselves in the balcony of
the house of <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, conversing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lida</span> arrived at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00
 a.m.</st1:time>, saying that he could not find Martinez After which, he left
again to look for the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three
remained in the place talking up to <st1:time minute="30" hour="12">12:30 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Lida</span> did not
return, they went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> and Samson went to the house of Samson in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cambaroang</span> which was about
one-half kilometer from <span class="SpellE">Lida's</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ate, after which, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
took a rest, while Samson went to his field to clean the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> then
returned to the house of <span class="SpellE">Lida</span> alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he arrived in said house, nobody was in
the premises, so he sat on a sledge in the yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After clearing his field, Samson, with a
relative, accused Roberto Flores, proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>,
and on the way, they met <span class="SpellE">Senando</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
who was also going to the barrio lieutenant to look for his missing <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When these
three arrived, there was nobody yet in the house as <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gagnao</span> and Milagros <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>
were harvesting <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in <span class="SpellE">Cambaroang</span>
from <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time> up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00</st1:time> p. m., together with <span class="SpellE">Corita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sualog</span>, who took her lunch with the said mother and
daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Emilio <span class="SpellE">Lida</span> failed to arrive in his house, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
instructed <st1:place>Flores</st1:place> to look for him, and he left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After some moments, <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
was then seated on a sledge and <span class="SpellE">Senando</span> was behind
him, while Samson was near a well drinking."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to how the killing took place, appellants would impress upon
this Court that it happened thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Upon <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>'
arrival, asked <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> why they were there and in
reply, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> asked him why he brought the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to the barrio lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
answered that he brought it there as they did not comply with the
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then in a loud and angry
voice, he added, 'You sons of prostitute, you are all good in amicable
settlement, I'm going to kill you and I am going to stay in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>
for that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
insisted that they settle the matter amicably.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While they were conversing, Samson approached them and asked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Is it true that you promised to return the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> after you are through making the furrow?' <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
then answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'You are like that, sons
of prostitute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after
uttering these words, <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
boxed Samson, but the latter was able to evade it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Mart­inez</st1:place></st1:city>
then took hold of the handle of his bolo as if he was going to draw the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To defend himself, Samson hacked <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
with the bolo he was then carrying for fear that the latter would hack him
first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
drew his bolo (he was able to raise the bolo up to the level of his breast),
Samson did not stop hitting him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hit
him many times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the first blow of
Samson, <span class="SpellE">Senando</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
ran away for fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
did not deliver fistic blow to the deceased; <span class="SpellE">Senando</span>
also did not hack the victim on any part of his body; and Roberto Flores was
not at the scene of the crime when the incident happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the incident <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Senando</span> have no weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> was
already far, he shouted at Samson to stop hacking the victim as the latter was
already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the incident Samson,
ran towards the <span class="SpellE">pobla­cion</span> and on the way he overtook
<span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Senando</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Samson accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>,
went to the municipal building and sur­rendered himself to the Chief of
Police."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, after evaluating the evidence gave "full
weight and credit to the testimony of the State witnesses, which is probable,
clear and unbiased."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is
nothing in the records which shows that the witness for the prosecution - the
barrio lieutenant, his wife and his daughter could have been motivated by no
other desire than to tell the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact the barrio lieutenant is an elected public official and is pre­sumed to
have performed his functions regularly and well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two witness to the commission of the
crime, Milagros <span class="SpellE">Lida</span>, daughter of the barrio
lieutenant, and her mother, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gagnao</span>, were undeniably at a vantage place in witnessing
the deadly assault by four accused on the deceased <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span>
Martinez, as the daughter was in the veranda of their house overlooking the
yard where the crime took place, while the mother was at the window of the kit­chen
and there, was able to see very well the incident happening below the
house."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Why their testimony should be believed was stressed by the lower court
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The testimony of mother and
daughter jibe with each other in all important details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deadliness of the attack of the said four
accused find corroboration in the great number of mortal wounds suffered by the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span> Martinez which were caused by sharp
bladed instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the head, he
suffered seven (7) wounds; on the right and left upper extremities he suffered
ten (10) wounds; and on the right lower extremity one wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were contusions and fractures which
confirm the attack with blunt instruments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the daughter the gruesome events, the court cannot help but be
impressed with her sincerity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was at
the time so overwhelmed by the recalling of the events that she sobbed on the
witness stand."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion thus reached by the lower court must be
upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has, as was noted in People
v. <span class="SpellE">Gumahin</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
"in its favor the well-settled principle that as far as credibility is
concerned, the findings of the lower court which had the opportunity to see,
hear and observe the witnesses testify and to weigh their testimonies be
accorded the highest degree of respect by this Tribunal.” It is the rule then
for this Court to desist from "disturbing the conclusion of the trial
court concerning the credibility of the witnesses, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In seeking a reversal, of the judgment of conviction, appellants
invoked the plea of self-defense in their two assigned errors although the very
wording of the first error assigned is quite indicative of their own lack of
complete belief in the plausibility of their plea as it is phrased in the
conditional, "the deceased could be the aggressor as he had a grudge
against, the appellants", and the second merely would dispute the failure
of the lower court to give credence to their testimony that they acted in
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the number of
wounds of the deceased, nineteen (19) in number, the plea of self-defense
cannot be seriously entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it
has been constantly and uninterruptedly' held by this Honorable Tribunal United
States vs. Gonzales,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
to People vs. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
a span of sixty (60) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Gonzales case, the then Justice Torres considering ten
(10) wounds inflicted on the deceased correctly characterizes the allegation of
self-defense as "incredible because it is improbable." In People v. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>, this Court, thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>
had to reject the plea of self-defense which in his opinion was "belied
and <span class="SpellE">negatived</span>" by the "<u>nature</u>, <u>number</u>
<u>and</u> <u>location</u> of the decedent's wounds".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v. <span class="SpellE">Sornera</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
speaks to the same effect thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The theory of self-defense on the part of Pablo is clearly <span class="SpellE">negatived</span> by the numerous (19) wounds inflicted upon
Felix.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, such wounds
are indicative of aggression and of the participation therein of
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another opinion of this
Court in People v. <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
it was persuasively stressed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Finally, the number of wounds on the body of the deceased, and
their location as registered in the autopsy report, expose the inherent
weakness of the claim to self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were in all fifteen wounds, one in the neck, two in the abdomen,
seven in the chest and the others in the various parts of the arms".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two alleged errors assigned by appellants
therefore do not call for a reversal of, the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court was correct in finding that the killing of the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Almaquio</span> Martinez constituted murder,
qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appropriate
penalty on each of the appellant as set forth in the opening paragraph of this
opinion, was meted out, Samson <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> being
