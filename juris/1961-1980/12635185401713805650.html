appellant <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span>
was charged with having raped, on April 10, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Morados</span></span><span style="">, a minor a little over </span>13 years of
age, daughter, by a former marriage, of his common-law wife, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
trial upon <span style="">a </span>plea of not guilty
he was convicted <span style="">as </span>charged and
sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>,
with the accessory penalties of the <span class="GramE">law</span>, to indemnify
the offended party in the amount of P5,000.00, to acknowledge and support her
offspring, and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
satisfied with the decision <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span> appealed to this
court claiming that the trial court erred firstly, "in not finding that
the presumption of innocence had not been overcome by the uncorroborated <span style="">and self-contradictory </span>testimony of
the complaining witness; "secondly, "in not finding from the
testimony of the complaining witness that the latter offered no resistance to
the alleged intercourse,” and lastly, "in ignoring and in giving no weight
whatsoever to the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> <span class="SpellE">esculpatory</span>
evidence for the defense."</p>

<p class="BODY">Former Justice Roman <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>,
appellant's attorney de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, has submitted a
forceful and vigorous brief in his behalf, contending, on the basis of the
careful and detailed summation of the evidence presented by both par­ties made
therein, that appellant should be acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall first take up appellant's contention that complainant's
testimony is insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence in his
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Morados</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay were husband and wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon Laura's death several years prior to the
commission of the crime subject of prosecution, he was survived by <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> and five minor children, one of whom was <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>, born on <st1:date year="1953" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime after the
death of <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>
became the common-law wife of appellant, also a widower with two sons named <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> and Orlando, at the time 13 and 12 years old,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all lived in a house
located in barrio <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the testimony of the offended party, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1967</st1:date> she was boiling coffee
and cooking rice <span style="">in </span>the kitchen
of their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother had already
left the house to look for someone who would hire her to plant rice; her two
half <span style="">sis</span>ters, Virginia and
Carmen, were sent by appellant to buy bread, while her half brother <st1:city><st1:place>Orlando</st1:place></st1:city>
was still fast asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While thus alone
doing her chores, appellant came and sud­denly held her by the shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon she screamed, but this
notwithstanding appellant forcibly laid her down, and in spite "of the
struggle" she put up, he was able to remove her panty, then parted her
legs and inserted his penis into her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After satisfying his lust, appel­lant warned her not to tell her mother
anything about the incident for otherwise he would kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because she was afraid of him she
answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, Father." Then
in the afternoon of the same day <span style="">while </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tarcela</span></span><span style=""> </span>was rocking to sleep her 1-1/2 year
old half sister <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>, appellant approached her and
again forced her to lie down, and once more succeeded in having sexual
intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the month of
June of the same year - the exact date of which she could not remember -
appellant again succeeded in abusing her for the third time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant bolsters his contention by <span style="">claiming </span><span style="">that the
testimony of </span>the offended party is not only uncorro­borated but also
suffers from serious and substantial inconsistencies.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is conceded that the
offended party refrained from telling her mother about what appellant had done
to </span>her until about the end of July 1967 when her mother noticed her <span style="">pregnancy; that </span>it was only after her
mother had repeatedly asked her who had caused her pregnancy that she revealed
that it was the herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This,
how­ever, was due to the fact that appellant had threatened her with death if <span style="">she told her mother about what had been </span>done
to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering her tender <span style="">age at the time </span>and the obvious moral
influence <span style="">that appellant exercised over
her, this </span>could be <span style="">easily </span>believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a </span>matter
<span style="">of fact, her </span>own mother, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay, must have been <span style="">afraid </span><span style="">of her </span>common-law
husband, because instead <span style="">of confronting
</span>him and <span style="">telling </span>him about
<span class="SpellE">Tarcela's</span> revelation, <span style="">she decided </span>to file, as in fact she filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1967</st1:date>, the corresponding
complaint for rape against him with the Municipal Court of <span style="">Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>On the same day, Dr. </span>Salvador V. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Fuñe</span></span><span style="">, </span>municipal health officer, subjected <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> to a physical <span style="">examination
</span>and <span style="">later </span><span class="SpellE">setforth</span> his findings in a medical certificate as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Abdominal palpation:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The <span class="SpellE">fundus</span> <span class="GramE">uteri is</span>
one finger below the um­bilicus, compatible with 5-6 months preg­nancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Small fetal parts are palpable on the left
flanks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A small rounded mass is
appreciable on <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">hypogatrium</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <span class="SpellE">auscu­lation</span>, fetal heart beats were heard on the right
lower abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uterine <span class="SpellE">soufle</span> were also heard on both right iliac regions.</p>

<blockquote>"Internal examination:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The vagina readily admits two fingers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hymen <span style="">is no longer appreciable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
cervix uteri is closed, hard and non?painful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"These findings are compatible with 5-6
months pregnancy."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For his </span>part,
appellant denied having committed the <span style="">crime
imputed to him claiming that on April 10, 1967, </span><span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>
was not living in his <span style="">house but in that
of Maxima </span><span class="SpellE">Marcillana</span> located in barrio San
Fernando, Sta. Cruz, whom she had been serving as <span style="">a maid since </span><span style="">March </span><span style="">19, 1967, </span>and remained there until the
<span style="">month of May </span>of the same
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further <span style="">testified that on April </span>10, 1967, he left his house at 4:30 a.m.
together with his barrio-mate, <span style="">Jose <span class="SpellE">Merin</span>, </span>with whom he walked to barrio <span class="SpellE">Tubotubo</span>, of the same <span style="">municipality,
located </span>approximately three kilometers far from his house, to work on <span style="">the construction of the house of one <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Montalla</span> which </span>had
began in March of that year; that they arrived in <span style="">barrio </span><span class="SpellE">Tubotubo</span> <span style="">at about six o'clock </span>in the morning
and, after resting for a while, started working until they stopped at <span style="">five o'clock that </span>afternoon, after
which he and <span class="SpellE">Merin</span> walked back home.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated heretofore, appellant claims that the testimony of the
offended party not only stands un­corroborated but <span style="">is </span>plagued with inconsistencies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After examining the record, we are left with the conviction that the
alleged inconsistencies or contradictions in the testimony <span style="">of the </span>offended party do not
materially impair her credibility, bearing as they do on mere details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, we are of the opinion that
the inconsis­tencies pointed out in appellant's brief are not suffi­cient to
render unbelievable the offended party's clear and positive testimony to the
effect that appellant, <span style="">the </span>common-law
husband of her mother, early in the morning of April 10, 1967, held her by the
shoulders, then forced her to lie down, parted her legs, took off her panty and
proceeded to rape her.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the offended party's testimony <span style="">is </span>uncorrobora­ted is of little moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime of rape is, as a rule, committed
without anybody else being present-with the exception of the rapist and the <span style="">victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>To say that be­cause no witness corroborated the testimony of the
latter, the same should be deemed insufficient to prove the crime would make it
impossible to convict any person charged with such offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is clear from the evidence that <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>
Malay, mother of the offended party and appellant's common-law wife, loved him
enough to live with him as wife even without the benefit of marriage, and to
bear him three daughters; that she, her children with appel­lant and her own
children with her deceased husband, depended upon him for their support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would not <span style="">have </span>consented that he be brought to court charged with the
serious offense of rape if she was not convinced of his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, of course, claimed that <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> did so because he had <span style="">a </span><span style="">quarrel with her about
</span><span style="">a </span>small amount of money
he had entrusted to her care and which she spent, without his knowledge and
consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is too flimsy to convince
anyone.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant makes a final attempt to assail the credibility of the
offended party by trying to prove that on <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1967</st1:date> she was not living in his house but in that
of Maxima <span class="SpellE">Marcillana</span> whom she had been serving as <u>maid</u>
(house help).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We firmly believe,
however, that his testimony to this effect, corroborated by that of Rafael <span class="SpellE">Ecaldre</span>, cannot prevail over that of the offended party and
that of Maxima <span class="SpellE">Marcillana</span>, the relevant portions of <span style="">whose testimony we reproduce here:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, we find it hard to believe that appellant
left his house on <st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1967</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="30" hour="4">4:30 a.m.</st1:time> and started working in
the house of <span class="SpellE">Montalla</span> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
simply not done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carpenters engaged in

</span>Their usual starting hour is <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bearing this in mind it appears clear that
appellant, after committing the rape around <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6:00
 a.m.</st1:time> was able to go to the job site thereafter and started working
thereat at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>His alibi, therefore, is far from being
convincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, we have the circumstance that His Honor, the trial judge
who had the peculiar advantage of having heard the testimony of the offended
party chose to believe and accept it as true and as sufficient for purposes of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our attention has not been
called to any recorded fact or circumstance of sufficient importance to justify
our reversing the following findings and conclusions of His Honor:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> <span class="SpellE">Morados</span>
was orphaned of her father at an early age.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Born on <st1:date year="1953" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1953</st1:date>,
she was only seven years old when her mother be­came the common-law wife of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although she was pregnant when
she testified on <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1967</st1:date>,
she appeared to the Court to be a fair skinned, pretty and pertly formed girl
of fourteen years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her harrowing
experience made her tearful at times in the course of her long testimony but
throughout she maintained her child-like innocence in answering questions
propounded to her both on direct and on cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court noted that a shadow of anxiety
often crept to her face whenever the accused gave her dagger looks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet she did not waver or fumble in her
detailed accusation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in that battle
of glances between her and <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span>, the latter
invariably lowered his eyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, that fierce look of the accused melted into one of
enervation after <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> and her mother were through
in their respective declarations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thenceforth, the counte­nance of the accused became a picture of
cautious dejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he testified,
it was in a languid voice and he appeared to be unsure of what he was to
say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These observations of the Court led
it to conclude:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, that the accused
dominated by terror not only the life of <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> but
also that <span style="">of her mother, because <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay likewise dis­played in Court </span>that same
reaction of fear for the accused <span style="">as </span>she
tes­tified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the evidence, shows
that <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay, after being in­formed by <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> that the accused <span style="">was responsible for her </span>pregnancy, <span style="">could not even confront <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span> because she
was worried he might </span>kill her and her daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accused could strike fear in the heart
of <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay, he could easily subdue with terror <span style="">a </span>young girl like <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>
<span class="SpellE">Morados</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
explains the inexorable fact that although <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>
fought for her honor <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> the accused de­flowered
her, she kept to herself her disgrace until her pregnancy gave her away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, as between the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> <span class="SpellE">Morados</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span>, that of the
former is more unfeigned, straight­forward, frank and sincere; while that of
the latter <span style="">is </span>deceptive,
evasive, hallow and deep in half-truths.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not beyond the realm of reality that the accused would rape <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> <span class="SpellE">Morados</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His moral fiber <span style="">is </span>strained as shown by the fact that he took <span class="SpellE">Tarcela's</span> mother <span style="">as
</span>his bedmate without bo­thering to marry her although both were without
impediment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had mother and daughter
completely under subjection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay <span style="">could
not and would not dare ex­tricate herself from that sinful union because of her
three little children </span>with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> could not also leave the house of the accused, even
had she wanted to, because she had nowhere to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
central figure in the lives </span>of <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Malay
and her three little children, and of <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>,
inevitably was the accused, being the sole provider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">t</span>his
irreversible circumstance, it <span style="">is </span>inconceivable
if <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> would trump up charges <span style="">against <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span> or </span><span style="">her </span><span style="">mother would permit it, unless the same were true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Modelo</span> </span>was <span style="">the barrier against hunger and </span>want
for this family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because <span style="">of this fact, he had a towering </span>moral
influence over them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Morados</span></span><span style=""> was not related to him, but he saw her bloom
into a desirable girl to whom he could empty himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his dominance over the girl and the
mother, as could be gleaned from their respective testimonies that they feared
him, it was easy and safe for the accused to rape <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>
as it was difficult for the girl to frustrate him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That opportunity came to <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span>
that early morning of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="10" month="4"><span style="">April 10, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> when he found himself almost alone with <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span>, for his son, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Orlando</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> was fast asleep in the room and baby <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> was of no consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Orlando</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> would wake up while the accused was doing
the revolting </span>act, he would not report on <span style="">his </span>own <span style="">father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So <span class="SpellE">Modelo</span> raped <span class="SpellE">Tarcela</span> in the manner testified to by the girl in open </span>court
(pp. 9, 10, 11, <span style="">Decision)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's other contention that the offended party offered no
resistance when appellant had sexual intercourse with her is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the testimony of the offended party does not
show that there was intimidation before or during the intercourse, and that her
admission that while appellant was on top of her, <span style="">her </span>hands were on <span style="">her
sides show that she had offered no resistance to the commission of the act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place, it is clear from the testimony of the offended party that appellant, a <span style="">full grown man of more than 40 years of age,
employed force upon her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She held her by
the shoulders; then forced her to lie down, and then took off her panty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, we don't know what kind
of "resistance" was expected to be offered by a young innocent
13-year old girl against the common-law husband of her mother, of whom she must
have been so much awed that when he told her not to tell her mother about what
he had done to her, she meekly answered:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Yes, father."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><span style="">fact, however, is that she really and actually
"struggled" and offered resistance, </span>as <span style="">shown by the </span><span style="">following
pertinent portions of her testimony:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
