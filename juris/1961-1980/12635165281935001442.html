				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioners Castro, heirs of <span style="">the late </span>Daniel T. <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span> of <span class="SpellE">Dalahican</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, sought from
the authorities compensation for two lots (No. 5 of Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 1709 and No. 6 of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 442) <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> 12,045 square meters, which are occupied by the
National Government and form part of the national highway from <span class="SpellE">Noveleta</span> to <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This road was built as far back as 1917.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time the land was part of that
covered by Original Certificates of Title Nos. 168, 48 and 443, <span style="">issued </span>in 1916 in the name of Daniel
T. <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span>, who died in 1939.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that no <span style="">annotation
in </span>favor<span style=""> </span>of the
government appears at the back of the original certificates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot No. 5, assessed at P570.00, and Lot No.
6, assessed <span style="">at </span>P3<span class="GramE">,290.00</span>, are covered by corresponding Tax Declarations in
the name of <span class="SpellE">Tirona’s</span> heirs, who have paid the real
estate taxes thereon up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No deed of conveyance to the Government by the registered owner or by
his heirs appears to have been executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1952 (Appendix 12) the heirs complained to the
District Engineer, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Taña</span>, for the non-payment
of their lots occupied by the national road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Negotiations for the execution of <span style="">a
</span>right of way agreement were made, but the parties could not agree on the
terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later in 1960, the claim was
submitted to the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Auditor General, in a decision dated 9 March 1963, rejected
the claim on the ground that (a) it is to be presumed that previous consent of
the original owner had been obtained and the value of the land used was paid to
him, such being the regular course of business; (b) that if no payment had been
made, the claim had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the Auditor General's decision suffers from legal
infirmities, and may not be <span style="">sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption of regularity is not applicable, because the land
having been registered under the Torrens system since 1916, no conveyance can
affect it without proper recording thereof and its being entered in the office
of the Register of Deeds,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and annotated in the back of the
Certificate of Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, no
such entry or annotation appears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> so certifies (Record on
Appeal, pages 17 and 18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
corroborated by the fact that the portions occupied by the highway are still
covered by Certificates in the name of the heirs of the original owner.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the land was ever conveyed to the Government by way of sale,
the regular course of business is for the deed of conveyance to be recorded, in
which event the registered deed would show whether payment was made or
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is ordinary usage of which the
Court can take judicial cognizance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same remarks apply if the land was gratuitously conveyed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for by law no donation of immovable property
could be valid between the parties unless made to appear in a public document,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and, pursuant to the Land Registration Act, such document ought, likewise, to
be recorded in order to affect the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The<span style=""> </span>absence of any record
of a conveyance of the land by the registered owner, therefore, rebuts the
presumption relied upon in the ruling under appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be that, in fact, the conveyance was
executed but not recorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such
conduct would be abnormal and irregular, so that the burden of proving the
existence of the conveyance and the payment of the price would be upon the
Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, the lapse of the prescriptive period would normally
suffice to bar recovery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court,
however, has recognized an exception to the rule, in those cases where the
Government has taken possession of private registered lands without paying
compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such event, the duty to
pay for the land subsists, regardless of the passage of time (Herrera vs.
Auditor General, 102 Phil. 875; Alfonso vs. <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
106 Phil. 1017).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the last case
mentioned, this Court decreed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"'The present case <span style="">finds
</span>its parallel in the recent case of Herrera <span style="">vs. </span>Auditor General, G. R. No.
L-10776, decided by this Tribunal on January 23, 1958, where a registered owner
of land in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City was deprived of its possession
when it was taken over by the city government for road <span style="">purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner thereof made
demands for the payment of his land, and although the City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City indorsed favorable action on the claim,
however, the Auditor General rejected said claim on the ground of
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, we held that
registered lands are not subject to <span class="GramE">prescription,</span> and
that on grounds of equity, the government would pay for private property which
it appropriates though for the benefit of the public, regardless of the passing
of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Tribunal does not look
with favor on the practice of the Government or any of its branches of taking
away property from a private landowner, especially a registered one, without
going through the legal process of expropria­tion or <span style="">a </span>negotiated sale and paying for said property without
delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private owner is usually at a
great and distinct disadvantage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
against him the whole Government, central or local, that has occupied and
appropriated his property summarily and arbitrarily, sometimes, if not more
often, against his consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
agreement as to its price or its rent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, the landowner makes request for payment, rent, or even
some understanding, patiently waiting and hoping that the Government would soon
get around to hearing and granting his claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The officials concerned may promise to consider his claim and come to an
agreement as to the amount and time for compensation, but with the <span style="">not infrequent government </span>delay and
red tape, and with the change in administration, <span class="GramE">specially</span>
local, the claim is pigeonholed and <span style="">forgotten
</span>and the papers lost, mislaid, or even destroyed as happened during the
last <span style="">war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And when finally losing patience and
hope, he brings a court action and biros a lawyer to represent him in the
vindication of his valid claim, he faces the government represented by no less
than the Solicitor General or the Provincial Fiscal or City Attorney, who
blandly and with self-assurance, invoke prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The litigation sometimes drags on for
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, that is neither
just nor fair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span style="">a </span>citizen, because of this practice
loses faith in the government and its readiness and willingness to pay for what
it gets and appropriates, in the future said citizen would not allow the
Government to even enter his property unless condemnation proceedings are first
initiated, and the value of the property, <span style="">as </span>provisionally ascertained by the Court, is deposited, subject
to his disposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would mean delay
and difficulty for the Government, but all of its own making.'"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The applicability of the doctrine laid down in the Herrera and
Alfonso cases was recognized by the Secretary of justice in his opinion of <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="12">28 December 1962</st1:date>, advising payment
of the claim of the heirs of Miguel <span class="SpellE">Malibas</span> (Appendix
23).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor General seeks to
differentiate the case dealt with in said opinion from that of claimants herein
by underlining the passage to the effect that "the claim may be
entertained if the road in question was constructed . . . only several years <u>after</u>
the issuance of the title".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the distinction is imaginary:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for while the <span class="SpellE">Noveleta-Cavite</span>
road was built in 1917, it is of record that the lands of the late Daniel <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span> were registered, and the original certificate
thereto was issued in the previous year, 1916.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the appealed decision supported by the provisions of
Republic Act 440, prescribing that the Certificates issued to landowners, as a
result of the subdivision of their property, should be subject to the condition
that the lots covered by highways or roads marked on the subdivision plan
"shall not be closed or disposed of, in any manner or form, without the
prior approval of the Court".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason is that the herein claimants, heirs of the late Daniel <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span>, are not closing off or disposing of lots 5 and 6,
but only seek compensation for the taking of the lots designated in their
certificates of title as forming part of the public highway.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts, this Court is of the opinion that justice and
equity demand that the Government should indemnify the landowners for the value
of the land as of the time of the taking of the lots in question and reimburse
the land taxes paid thereon since that time, the owners having been deprived of
the enjoyment of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision under appeal is, therefore, reversed, and the
Government directed to pay to the claimants the assessed value of the lots in
question in 1917 plus the amount of the land taxes heretofore paid by them upon
the said lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without
costs.</span></p>
