Commission which affirmed the <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="10">October
 29, 1975</st1:date> Order of the Acting Referee <span style="">dismissing petitioner's claim for compensation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1976</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">We</span> denied the aforesaid petition for late payment of
legal fees (p. 17, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE however
reconsidered said denial on <st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May </span>3, 1976</st1:date>, upon <span style="">a </span>motion for reconsideration thereof
filed by petitioner, and required respondent company to comment on the petition
(p. 24, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">After receipt and consideration of the aforesaid comment, <span class="GramE">We</span> resolved on <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="6">June
 7, 1976</st1:date> to <span style="">treat </span>the
petition as a special civil action (p. 31, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then submitted his memorandum on <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1976</st1:date>, while private
respondent company filed its memorandum on <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1976</st1:date>, the case
was deemed submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Disclosed by the records are the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was employed as a carpenter by
respondent company with a daily wage of ten (P10.00) pesos, working seven (7)
days a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1973</st1:date> (pp. 24-26, WCC rec.), while
petitioner, together with some co-workers, was carrying a water pump in the
course of his employment, his right foot sank in a muddy place and was
twisted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He instantly felt a crack in his
back that caused pain from his right leg to the upper portion of his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eduardo Arciaga, petitioner's foreman, has
personal knowledge of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Believing that it was just a case of pulled muscle, petitioner continued
to work until <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1973</st1:date>,
when he could no longer bear the pain from his right foot to his waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner immediately submitted himself to a
medical examination at the company-engaged <st1:place><st1:placename>Cotton</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> and was therein
hospitalized up to <st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was again hospitalized for the same injury
from <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1974</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he was allowed regular treatment,
free of charge, at the same <st1:place><st1:placename>Cotton</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without his injury being completely cured,
the free treatment was stopped and the respondent company extended to
petitioner the amount of seven hundred fifty (P750.00) pesos as financial
assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was on <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed his position paper on <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1975</st1:date> (p. 23, WCC rec.) on his claim
for compensation earlier filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="3">March
 13, 1975</st1:date> with the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was assigned to Acting Referee Celso
C. Ladera, a member of the Task Force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the parties had submitted their respective affidavits and
evidence, the Acting Referee issued on October 29, 1975 an Order dismiss­ing
petitioner's compensation claim on the ground that petitioner was not an
employee of the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, while finding
that there existed an employer-employee relationship between petitioner and
respondent<span style="">, company, nevertheless,
affirmed the dismissal </span>order of the acting referee <span style="">on </span><span style="">the ground that </span><span style="">petitioner
failed </span><span style="">"x x </span><span style="">to prove the particular </span>ailment or
injury he suffered on November 13 (should be 10), 1973 and its causal
connection with the nature of his employment with the respondent." The
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> said:</p>

<blockquote>"Notwithstanding the existence of employer-employee
relationship, however, at the time when the alleged accident happened, we are
inclined to affirm the order of dismissal for failure of the claimant to prove
the particular ailment or injury he suffered on November 13 (should be 10),
1973 and its causal connection with the nature of his employment with the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is clear is that, he
suffered pains on his right leg that went up to his back without establishing
any disabling ailment or injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant
has therefore failed to establish his claim by substantial evidence." <span class="GramE">(P. 14, rec.).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The instant order of
dismissal is a clear case of a grave abuse of discretion on the part of </span>the
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a patent error and
therefore must be set aside.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 2 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, Act No. 3428, as amended, </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">explicit that </span><span style="">"[W]</span><span style="">hen an employee suffers personal injury from

there can be no question that the personal injury that disabled herein
petitioner was the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of
employment; for </span>the respondent company never presented evidence to the
contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the chain of events
subsequent to the accident that befell petitioner on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1973</st1:date>, <span style="">as </span>narrated by petitioner in his affidavit --</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">easily</span></span><span style=""> leads to
the conclusion that petitioner did suffer personal injury from the </span><st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November
 10, 1973</span></st1:date><span style=""> accident
that rendered him inutile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The causal
and circumstantial connection between his personal injury and employment is but
too apparent under the facts of the case.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The basis of the Commission's Order dismissing the compensation
claim which is the alleged failure of<span style="">
the petitioner "x x to prove the particular ailment or injury he suffered
on November 13 (should be 10), 1973 and its causal connection with the nature
of his employment with respondent x x" is not only clearly unfounded, but
likewise betrays the Commission's distorted shifting of the burden of proof in
compensation cases in relation to the presumption of compensability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the documentary evidence on record,
there </span>can be no denying the fact that indeed petitioner was <span style="">injured in that </span><st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November 10, 1973</span></st1:date><span style=""> accident which thereafter disabled him from
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And furthermore, petitioner's SSS
Medical Certificate shows that he is suffering from Herniated Nucleus Pulposus
L5 SI, L5 Root Radiculopathy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This final
diagnosis was dated </span><st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="8"><span style="">August 26, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> (pp. 46-47, WCC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this Court is amazed at the cavalier
manner the Commission disposed of this compensation claim, particularly the
bases of its conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Either the respondent Commission overlooked the entire evidence
on <span class="GramE">record,</span> specially the SSS Medical Certificate
attached to the record, or ignored them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There are reasonable
bases to conclude that petitioner's illness of hernia was the direct result of
or is traceable to that accident of </span><st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November 10, 1973</span></st1:date><span style=""> and/or the nature of his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's work with respondent company was
described by a coworker of his as follows: "x x na masasabi kong may
kabig-atan ang trabaho namin sa nasabing pagawaan (construction) at sari-sari
uring trabahong karaniwan ay mabig-at ito (pag-insulat ng tubo, pagbubuhat ng
bakal, paghuhukay para sa tubo, pag-akyat sa itaas ng gusaling planta upang
maglagay ng andanyo, at iba pa, bukod sa nasa labas kami ng ulanan at
arawan;" (p. 26, WCC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">According
to Horovitz (4 </span>NACCA L.J., <span style="">71-73),
</span>where disease results from a personal injury, the sickness (illness)
constitutes an injury by accident and therefore a compensable physical harm
(Fernandez &amp; Quiazon Labor Standards and Welfare Legislation, 484 [1964]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be thus compensable the disease must come
from, or be, an accident arising from the nature of his work or employment and
occurred in the course thereof (Ibid., p. 484, citing Rolan vs. Perez, 63 Phil.
80).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>American courts have held that
hernia due to strain over a period of a few months <span style="">(Mill's </span>case, 155 N.E. 423) or resulting from strain suffered in
such activities as lifting heavy timbers, lifting heavy bundles of paper,
pushing a heavy box of pipe across a floor, pushing a heavy wheelbarrow,
picking up a log, pulling a tong chain, lifting a bale of wire, and pushing a
coal car in a mine, have been held compensable even though the injury itself
constituted the only mishap (5 SCHNEIDER Workmen's Compensation Text, 578-579
[permanent Ed.]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of herein
petitioner is analogous to the foregoing cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, even precluding
any actual injury sustained by petitioner on the very day of the accident
(November 10, 1973), his compensation claim can still stand on his illness of
hernia; which as aforestated can be reasonably attributed or traceable to the
accident that befell petitioner and/or the nature of his work with respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is furthermore in
favor of petitioner the well-settled doctrine that when an illness supervened during
the course of employment, like petitioner's illness, there is the rebuttable
presumption that the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">arose out of or at least was aggravated in
the course of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with
that presumption the burden </span>of proving by substantial evidence that the
illness was not work-connected shifts to the employer and the claimant is
relieved of the burden to show causation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case, there was patent failure on the part of respondent
company to discharge that burden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the presumption becomes conclusive; and that alone entitles petitioner to a
compensation award.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, there is likewise merit it the contention of petitioner
that all the requisites for the compensability of hernia as laid down by the
Evaluation Division of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in the case of
Bonilla vs. WCC(13 SCRA 748 [1965]), which are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that the hernia is of recent origin; (2) that its appearance was
accompanied by pain, discoloration and evidence of tearing of these tissue; (3)
that it was immediately preceded by some strain out of and in the course of
employment; and (4) that a protrusion or mass appeared in the area immediately
following the alleged strain, are present in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There can be no question
as to the presence </span>of the first three requisites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attendant circumstances of petitioner's
injury or illness as earlier described attest to the presence of the said requi<span style="">sites.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although there is no positive evidence on records to show the presence
of the last <span class="GramE">requisite, that,</span> however, can easily be
presumed on the basis of the final diagnosis on petitioner's illness as
Herniated Nucleus Pulposus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the facts obtaining, petitioner, who appears to be
incapacitated from work up to the present, is entitled to the maximum
compensation benefits of Six Thousand (P6,000.00) Pesos (Sec. 14, Act 3428, as
amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since that is the <span style="">maximum </span>allowed by law, his additional
claim of One Thousand and Five Hundred Ten (P1<span class="GramE">,510.00</span>)
Pesos, although undisputed, cannot be awarded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His undisputed claim for medical reimbursement in the amount of Three
Hundred Forty-Four (P344.00) Pesos <span style="">is, </span>however,
allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, because of the
facts and circumstances obtaining in this case and considering petitioner's
pathetic condition, respondent company is further ordered to comply with
Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before finally disposing of this compensation case, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot but express Our strong disapproval over the manner
the Commission decided this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
impugned order of the Commission was indeed a foul blow to the social justice
clause of the Constitution and its injunction for the State to afford
protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Workmen's Compensation <span style="">Commission, </span>like
the defunct Court of Industrial Relations, as an agency of the State is "x
x under obligation at all times to give meaning and substance to these
constitutional guarantees in favor of the working man; for otherwise these
constitutional safeguards would be merely a lot of 'meaning­less patter'
(Philippine Blooming Mills Employees Organization, et al. vs. Philippine <span style="">Blooming Mills Co., </span>Inc., et al., 51
SCRA 189, 210-211 [1973]<span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed, <span class="GramE">We</span>
had many a time in the past called the attention of the now defunct Workmen's
Compensation Commission to its failure to observe fealty to the social justice
directive of the Constitution and dissuaded it from assuming such posture (Vda.
de Leorna, et al. vs. WCC, et al., L-42543, Sept. 30, 1976). The Workmen's
Compensation Act, which the Commission is mandated to implement, is a social
legislation designed to provide prompt and reasonable compensation to the
workman who had been the victim of an accident in the pursuit of his
employment; to the end that he may not become entirely "destitute and
possibly a charge upon society."</p>
