				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">From an order of the
Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissing the complaint in this case, <span style="">plaintiff has come directly to the Supreme </span>Court,
upon the ground that only questions of law would be raised in the appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 23, 1962,
defendants <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pecate</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Alfaro, members of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, Iloilo, pur­porting to act pursuant to section
538 <span style="">of the Revised Administrative Code,
seized </span>from plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Landa</span> a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, for which he
produced a certificate of ownership in <span style="">the
name </span>of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Elvas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said peace officers turned the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> over to the municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Campo, who, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, upon the authority of section 540 of said
Code, sold the animal at public auction, which was duly approved by the
Provincial Board on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="7"><span style="">July 26, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
an affidavit dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Landa</span> tried to
explain that he had acquired the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, by barter
with an older <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, from <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>, who, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="8"><span style="">August 1, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, was charged, in the Justice of the Peace
Court of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, with swindling; but he has not
been apprehended up to the present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On or about April 16, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Landa</span>
commenced in said court, the present action against Francisco Tobias, the Municipal
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, its Municipal Treasurer, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> del Campo, its Chief of Police, <span class="SpellE">Regio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Subong</span>, and the aforementioned
policemen, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pecate</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Alfaro, for the recovery of damages with
costs, upon the ground that he (plaintiff) had been wrongfully deprived of the
possession of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> above referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their answer, the defendants alleged, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the acts complained of had been
performed by them in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said court having, in due course, rendered judgment in favor of
the defendants, plaintiff appealed to the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, in
which the parties submitted a partial stipulation of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on, after the presentation of
plaintiff's evidence, which consisted of his testimony and some exhibits, the
defendants moved to dismiss the case, which the Court of First Instance
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's subsequent motion
for new trial having been denied, he interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff maintains that the lower court erred in holding <span style="">that he had no title to the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, for non-compliance, on his part, with the
provisions of the Revised Administrative Code, requiring the registration of
cattle, prescribing the procedure for the transfer thereof, regulating
amendments to certificates of ownership, and establishing the necessity of
registration and issuance of a certificate of transfer in order that the same
may be valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invokes the provision
of the Civil Code, governing contracts in general, to the effect that
"contracts shall be obligatory in whatever form they may have been entered
into provided all essential requisites for their validity are present."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <u>In</u> </span><u><span style="">addition</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">to the essential requi­sites specified in the
Civil Code, the Revised Administrative Code prescribes, however, another
requisite, as regards the transfer of title to cattle, namely, the registration
of said transfer and the issuance to the transferee of the corresponding
certificate of transfer,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> neither of which has been proven in the case
at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Although
plaintiff claimed to have the aforementioned certificate of transfer, but he
did not produce the same.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, plaintiff could not possibly have
such certificate, for the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was allegedly
conveyed to him by <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>,
whereas the registered owner is <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Elvas</span> - and plaintiff knew this fact - and there is no
competent proof that <span class="SpellE">Elvas</span> had ever assigned the
animal to <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the complaint for swindling filed against <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>
indicates that the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> did not belong to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of the aforementioned
provisions of the Revised Administrative Code, the title to the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> could not have passed, therefore, to <span class="SpellE">Landa</span>, in consequence of his alleged transaction with <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span>, who had no such title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss to note that <span class="SpellE">Mayormente</span> might be no more than a figment of the
imagination, for he has neither taken the witness stand nor been found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from this, the certificate of ownership, Exhibit A,
produced by the plaintiff to patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Pecate</span> and
Alfaro, was not in plaintiff's name and <u>admittedly bore signs of tampering</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the blank spaces in said printed
form were filled with words and figures written in <u>indelible</u> <u>pencil</u>,
the spaces for the year of its issuance and the age of the animal described
therein have traces of erasures and the figures 59 and 3, respectively, are
written thereon <u>in</u> <u>ink</u>, to indicate that the certificate had been
issued in <u>1959</u> and that said <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was then <u><span style="">three</span></u><span style=""> </span>(3) years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
original record of said document shows that it was issued in 1961 and the age
of said <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was then <u>one year and a half</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, it is clear that the policemen had
reasonable grounds to suspect that plaintiff's possession of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> was unlawful, as well as to seize the animal and de­liver
the same to the municipal treasurer as provided in Section 538 of the Revised
Administrative Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Pursuant thereto to Section 540 of the same Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
said municipal treasurer had, not only the authority, but, also, the
"duty" to issue, post and cause to be served a notice of the seizure
or taking of said animal, and, if the owners thereof "fail to <u><span style="">present</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>themselves</u> within the <span style="">time specified in the notice and <u>prove</u> <u>title</u> to the animals
taken or seized as aforesaid, " notice of such fact shall be given by said
officer to the provincial board, "which shall order said </span><span style="">an</span><span style="">imals to be sold at public auction, "
after giving the notice prescribed in said legal provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "purchaser at such sale shall"
- in the language of Section 540 - "receive a good and indefeasible title
to the animal sold."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even if plaintiff were
hypothetically the true owner of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in
question, his only remedy was, accordingly, to claim it before the municipal
treasurer and prove to the latter his (plaintiff's) title thereto, either prior
to or at the time of the auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not having done so, plaintiff can not now make such claim judicially and
try to prove his title - which, after all, he has failed to establish -much less
seek indemnity from the public officers who, by reason of their official
duties, had a hand in the seizure and sale of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering the
stipulation of the parties herein, to the effect that said sale had been "<u>duly</u>
approved by the Provincial Board, " apart from the legal presumption
"that official duty has been regularly performed,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we must assume that defendants herein had
complied with the requirements of the legal provisions above referred to, and,
consequently, they can not be held liable for the aforesaid seizure and sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff further alleges
that the lower court erred in not de­claring that the public auction of the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> in question as "astray" is against the
law, because the animal was taken or seized from him, not found <u>astray</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is groundless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not borne out by paragraph 3 of the
partial stipulation of facts cited by him in support thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale at public auction was held pursuant
to the aforementioned Section 540, captioned "Sale of unclaimed" - not
astray - "animal, " although referring to "all <span class="SpellE"><u>estray</u></span> and all animals recovered from thieves or <u>taken</u>
by peace officers from persons unlawfully or reasonably suspected of being
unlawfully in possession of the same" - which are the subject-matter of Section
538 - the owners of which "fail to present themselves within the time
fixed in the notice and prove title to the animals <u>taken</u> or <u>seized</u>
as aforesaid. " Such is, precisely, the situation obtaining in </span><span style="">the case at </span><span style="">bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
