<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an original petition for 
certiorari and prohibition against the Judge of the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Branch V, and the City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, praying for a writ of preliminary injunction 
enjoining said respondents from continuing with the hearing of Criminal Case No. 
1415-O in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> and for 
the annulment of the proceedings so far conducted by the respondent Judge in the 
said case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 25, 1962, <span class="GramE">an information</span> for grave coercion was filed before the City 
Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City (Criminal Case No. 5640) by the 
respondent City Attorney against petitioner Manuel F. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, which information was subsequently amended to 
include petitioner Felix <span class="SpellE">Pirante</span> as co-accused. The 
City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City took cognizance of the case 
in the exercise of its concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance 
of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, pursuant to Section 87 (c) of Republic Act 
296 as amended by Sec. 10 of Rep. Act 2613.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On July 21, 1962, judgment was 
rendered by the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City in Criminal 
Case No. 5640, finding the accused (petitioners herein) guilty of the crime of 
light coercion and sentencing them to pay a fine of fifty pesos, and damages 
amounting to three hundred forty-seven pesos, with subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On October 18, 1962, the 
petitioners filed with the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City a 
notice of appeal, stating that they were appealing their case to the Court of 
Appeals. In the notice of appeal it is stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It is hereby manifested that in 
the hearing of the above-entitled case no stenographic notes were taken as there 
was no <span class="GramE">stenographer</span> in 
court."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The clerk of court of the City 
Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, instead of transmitting the 
records of the case to the Court of Appeals; forwarded the same to the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, 5th Branch, at <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City. The respondent City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City filed a new information before the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, which was docketed as Criminal Case 
No. 1415-O, charging the petitioners of the same crime of grave coercion of 
which they were previously charged in Criminal Case No. 5640, in the City Court 
of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On November 28, 1962, the 
petitioners filed a motion to mash the information in Criminal Case No. 1415-O 
on the ground that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> has no appellate jurisdiction to try said criminal 
case because the petitioners had not appealed to the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, but to the Court of Appeals pursuant to Sec. 87 
(c) of Republic Act 296 as amended by Republic Act 2613; and that under the law 
it was the ministerial duty of the clerk of court of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City to forward the records of the case to the Court 
of Appeals and not to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On December 13, 1962, the 
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Numeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span> denied the motion to quash "for lack of sufficient 
merit" and set the arraignment of petitioners for December 28, 1962. The 
petitioners did not file any motion for the reconsideration of the order of 
respondent Judge denying the motion to quash. Upon motion of the accused 
(petitioners) the respondent Judge ordered the arraignment postponed to January 
8, 1963.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 8, 1963, the 
petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. entered a plea of "not 
guilty" and after entering his plea, he manifested an intention to file with the 
Supreme Court a petition for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary 
injunction. Said petition was filed before this Court on January 28, 1963. Upon 
the petitioners having filed a bond in the amount of two hundred pesos this 
Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction against the respondents, as prayed 
for in the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The questions for <span class="GramE">Us</span> to resolve in the present case are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Does the Court of First Instance 
of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Branch V, have jurisdiction to try and 
decide Criminal Case No. 1415-O pending in said Court? 
and<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Has this petition for certiorari 
and prohibition been filed in accordance with the Rules of 
Court?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The pertinent provision of the 
law involved in the present case is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Justices of the peace in the 
capitals of provinces and Judges of Municipal Courts shall have like 
jurisdiction as the Court of First Instance to try parties charged with an 
offense committed within the province, in which the penalty provided by law does 
not exceed <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></i> or imprisonment for not more than six yean 
or fine not exceeding three thousand pesos or both, and in the absence of the 
district judge, shall have like jurisdiction within the province as the Court of 
First Instance, to hear applications for bait<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">All cases filed under the next 
preceding paragraph with Justices of the Peace of capitals and municipal court 
judges shall be tried and decided on the merits by the respective justices of 
the peace or municipal judges. <i>Proceedings had shall be recorded and 
decisions therein shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> direct to the 
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be."</i> (Republic Act 
296, Sec. 87 (c) as amended by Rep. Act 2613; Italics 
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above-quoted provision of 
Sec. 87 (c) of Republic Act 296 was the one existing when Criminal Case No. 5640 
was commenced in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City. By 
subsequent amendment of Rep. Act 296, the term "Justice of the Peace" has been 
changed to "municipal judge" and the term "Judge of municipal court" has been 
changed to "City Judge."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The crime of grave coercion is 
punishable by <span class="SpellE"><i>arresto</i></span> <i>mayor and</i> a fine 
not exceeding P500.00. Because of the additional penalty of line, the crime of 
grave coercion is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of a municipal court of 
the capitals of provinces or a city court. It follows, therefore, that the city 
court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City had jurisdiction to try the 
petitioners herein .of the offense of grave coercion of which they were charged 
in Criminal Case No. 5640 before said court in the exercise of its concurrent 
jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance to try cases of the same nature, 
as provided in the above-quoted provision of Sec. 87(c) of Republic Act 296, as 
amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is admitted that the City 
Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City had concurrent jurisdiction with 
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> to try the 
criminal case wherein the petitioners were charged of the offense of grave 
coercion, and that when the city court assumed said jurisdiction it had thereby 
excluded the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> from the 
exercise of its jurisdiction to try the petitioners in a case which they are 
charged of the very same offense. It is also admitted that decisions of the City 
Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City in the exercise of this concurrent 
jurisdiction are directly <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court of 
Appeals as provided for in Sec. 87 (c) of Rep. Act. <span class="GramE">296, as 
amended.</span> But when the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City 
tried this Criminal Case No. 5640, it did not proceed in accordance with the 
provision of Sec. 87 (c) of Rep. Act. 296, as amended, which requires that 
"Proceedings had shall be recorder." The petitioners themselves admit that the 
proceedings had during the trial of this case were not recorder because "no 
stenographic notes were taken as there was no stenographer of court." We hold, 
therefore, that the trial of this case in the city court was not conducted in 
accordance with the law, and the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> 
City had not exercised its jurisdiction to try and decide this case in 
accordance with law. Consequently the decision rendered by the City Court of 
<span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> in Criminal Case No. 5640 of said court can not 
be appealed directly to the Court of Appeals because said decision was based on 
evidence that was taken during a trial or <span class="GramE">proceeding</span> 
that was not recorded as required by law. It is very elementary that the Court 
of Appeals cannot review the findings of facts of the trial court of there is no 
record o the evidence taken during the trial of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We hold that the proceedings in 
the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, in Criminal Case No. 
5640 was a nullity, not because the City Court had no jurisdiction to try the 
case but because the requirement of the law that the proceedings be recorded was 
not complied with. <span class="GramE">When it was provided in Sec. 87 (c) of Rep. 
296, as amended by Rep Act.</span> 2613, that the city court of chartered cities 
have like jurisdiction as the Court of First of Instance to try parties charged 
with an offense in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></i> 
or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> or both, the city court thereby acts as a Court of 
First Instance and its decisions are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> 
directly to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court, as the case may be. 
When the city court tries cases of this nature and its acts as a Court of First 
Instance, it must perforce act as a court of record. The very law itself 
provides that in the exercise of this jurisdiction by the municipal courts of 
provincial capitals and by city courts the proceedings must be recorded. 
Certainly, the decisions of the city court or of the municipal court of 
provincial capitals in the exercise of this jurisdiction are similar to 
decisions of the Court of First Instance, and their decisions, cannot be 
appealed to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court, as the case may be, if 
there are no records of their proceedings. When a city court, or the municipal 
court of provincial capitals, does not record its proceedings in the trial of a 
case in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Sec. 87 (c) of Republic Act 296, 
as amended, then it does not exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with law 
and therefore the proceedings had before it are null and 
void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We hold, therefore, that the 
decision of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City in its 
Criminal Casa No. 5640 is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court 
of Appeals, and the clerk of court of the city of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City acted properly when he remitted the records of 
said case to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, 
Branch V, in <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is deplorable that the 
proceedings in Criminal Case No. 0640 before the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City were not conducted in a manner as required by 
law. The City Judge should know the law, and he should not have allowed said 
illegal proceedings to take place before his court. The accused in said case 
(petitioners herein), who were assisted by counsel, should have known their 
rights- and should have insisted that the proceedings in the trial of the case 
against them be recorded. This is more so, because one of the two accused—the 
herein petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr.—is himself a 
lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the respondent City Attorney 
filed a new information in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, which was docketed as Criminal Case No. 1415-0, 
charging the petitioners of the same offense of which they were charged in 
Criminal Case No. 5640 in the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> 
City, said City Attorney actually filed a new criminal case against the 
petitioners; and the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> 
took cognizance of the case in the exercise of its original jurisdiction to try 
the case, and not its appellate jurisdiction over cases coming from the City 
Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City. We are of the opinion that the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> had not acted without 
or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion when it denied 
the motion to quash in Criminal Case No. 1415-O, and said court has jurisdiction 
to proceed with the hearing of said Criminal Case No. 1415-O. This is more so, 
because the records show that petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. was already arraigned in said case and he 
entered a plea of "not guilty." As far as the petitioner, Felix <span class="SpellE">Pirante</span>, is concerned the records show that he did not 
appear on the day set for arraignment and his arrest was ordered by the 
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The records show that before the 
respondent City Attorney for <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City filed the 
information for grave coercion in the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City (Criminal Case No. 5640) he had previously 
conducted the necessary preliminary investigation. That same preliminary 
investigation that was conducted by the respondent City Attorney can serve as 
the basis for the filing of the information in Criminal Case No. 1415-O in the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We now come to the second 
question to be resolved in this case: Whether this petition was filed in 
accordance with the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was brought to the attention 
of this Court by the respondents that after pleading not guilty to the crime 
charged in the information and thereby submitting to the jurisdiction of the 
respondent court, by said plea, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> 
merely announced his intention to file a Petition for certiorari and prohibition 
with the Supreme Court. The petitioners had not filed with respondent court any 
motion for reconsideration of the order denying their motion to quash. The 
respondents contend that because the petitioners had not filed any motion for 
reconsideration of the order denying their motion to quash they did not exhaust 
the adequate remedies available to them under the law before filing the present 
petition before this Court and, therefore, this petition should be 
denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We agree with the respondents 
that a motion for reconsideration of the order denying the motion to quash 
should have been filed with the respondent court before the petitioners proceed 
to file the present petition, and their failure to do so is definitely a fatal 
defect in the procedure that they had followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Because of the numerous <span class="GramE">decisions<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style11"><sup>1]</sup></span> rendered by this Court on this particular 
matter, it has become elementary that before filing a petition for certiorari 
with the higher court the attention of the lower court should first be called to 
its supposed error and its correction asked for, and if this is not done the 
petition for certiorari should be denied. Considering that the petitioners 
herein had not filed the required motion for reconsideration of the order 
denying the motion to quash before the respondent court prior to their filing of 
the present petition, this circumstance alone is sufficient reason to deny the 
present petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, this petition for certiorari 
and prohibition should be, as it is hereby denied, and the writ of preliminary 
injunction heretofore issued is dissolved, with costs against the 
petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
