				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present case originated from <span style="">a </span>petition for prohibition and mandamus with preliminary
injunction instituted on September 13, 1962 by petitioner in the Court of First
Instance of Manila, praying for the issuance of an order prohibiting respondent
Commissioner of Immigration from proceeding with the arrest and detention of
petitioner's above named wife and their two foreign-born minor children
preparatory to their expulsion from the country as overstaying temporary
visitors.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case the
parties submitted on August 24, 1965, <span style="">an
</span>amended stipulation of facts wherein it was brought out that on January
3, 1964, petitioner, upon previous authorization, over the State's objection,
of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Case No. 44530 thereof, had taken
his oath of allegiance as Filipino citizen and was issued by the clerk of court
the corresponding certificate of naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, following decisions of this Court that the alien
wife of a naturalized Filipino citizen does not automa­tically acquire his
citizenship but must prove in an appropriate proceeding her qualifications and
lack of disqualifications for Filipino citizenship, dismissed the petition with
respect to peti­tioner's wife and dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction
against her expulsion; directing respondent commissioner, how­ever, to take the
necessary action on the matter relevant to the status of petitioner's wife in
consonance with its opinion that she should be allowed to stay in the country
and be given an opportunity to prove that she might herself be lawfully
naturalized and thus acquire her husband's Filipino citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to petitioner's two minor
children, the lower court granted the petition with respect to them, making
permanent the writ of preliminary injunction issued by it against their
expulsion, expressing its opinion that they <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> became
Filipino citizens under the provisions of section 15 of the Revised
Naturalization Law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both parties appealed on
purely questions of law from the decision in so far as it was adverse to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 9, 1966, petitioner filed a manifestation pray­ing
that his appeal be dismissed and/or disregarded for having become moot and
academic since his wife had left the country on May 8, 1966 for <span class="SpellE">Taipeh</span>, Taiwan, and returned on May 15, 1966 to the
Philippines and had since been documented by respondent commissioner as a
permanent resident under section 13 of the <span style="">Immigration </span>Act of 1940 as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the filing on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1967</st1:date> of the Solicitor General's brief for
respondent commissioner, petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1967</st1:date>, a motion to dismiss appeal on the ground
that the issues raised in respondent's appeal have become moot and
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof, petitioner
submitted docu­ments showing that on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1967</st1:date>, he accompanied his two minor children out of the country
and returned with them to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1967</st1:date> and sought
their admission to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as Filipino citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of
Special Inquiry of the Bureau of Immigration rendered its decision dated <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1967</st1:date> admitting said minors
as Filipino citizens finding them to be the legitimate minor children of a
Filipino citizen, which decision was confirmed by the Immigration Bureau's
Board of <span class="SpellE">Comniissioners</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="8">August <span style="">3, </span>1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court acting on said motion to dismiss in its Resolution of
September 8, 1967 and "considering that on August 14, 1967 we considered
this case submitted for decision without <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief . . . . . RESOLVED that said motion be resolved when the <span style="">case is decided on the merits."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner in a manifestation dated August 30, 1968, submitting
that "<span style="">in </span>view of the fact
that the objections of the respondent-appellant to the continued stay in this
country of pe­titioner's wife and the <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> acquisition of
Philippine citi­zenship of the foreign-born minor children of petitioner have
been removed and/or corrected in accordance with the prevail­ing <span style="">rules </span>and
regulations and to the satisfaction of the respondent-appellant (the Commissioner
of Immigration, who affirmed the decisions of the Board of Special Inquiry
admitting petitioner's wife as a permanent resident and petitioner's
foreign-born minor children as Filipino citizens), the questions of law
allegedly raised by the respondent-appellant have now become moot and academic

present case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
compliance with this court's resolution requiring res­pondent's comment, the
Solicitor General filed on behalf of res­pondent commissioner under date of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="9"><span style="">September 11, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> his re­ply to

<blockquote>"COMES NOW the Commissioner of Immigration,
respondent-appellant in the above-entitled case, by the undersigned counsel,
and with refer<span style="">ence
to petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> Manifestation, dated August
30, 1968, to this Honorable Court respectfully states that he would interpose
no objection to the dismissal of the instant case, subject to the following
conditions, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The admission to this country of peti­tioner's
wife as permanent resident under Section 13 <span style="">(a) </span>of the Immigration Act, being the wife of a naturalized
Filipino (Decision of <span style="">May 24, 1966
Board of Special Inquiry, Annex 'A', </span><span style="">Manifestation), and the admission of
petitioner's foreign-born minor children as Filipino citizens (Decision of July
13, 2967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Board of Special Inquiry, </span><span style="">Annex 'D', </span><span style="">Manifestation)
shall retroact as to overcome the fact that they 'overstayed' beyond the
authorized period of sojourn as tem­porary visitors; and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>However,
petitioner's foreign-born minor children shall not be considered as Fili­pino
citizens considering the fact that at the time of petitioner's oath-taking as a
naturalized Filipino, said foreign-born minor children were 'not lawfully
dwelling' in their country (Vivo vs. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, G.R.
No. L-23239, <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1966</st1:date>),
<span style="">without
prejudice to whatever action the Soli­citor General may presently take towards
the cancellation of the naturalization of petitioner."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, under date of <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1968</st1:date>, filed a re­joinder to said reply as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a close scrutiny of the full import of
paragraphs 1 and 2 of respondent's reply to Manifestation shows two
diametrically opposed positions in view of the fact that in the first paragraph
of its Reply, respondent premises its <span style="">conformity to the dismissal of the instant case on
the retroactive effect of the admission of petitioner's foreign-born minor
children as Filipino citizens (Decision of July 13, 1967, Board of Special
Inquiry, Annex 'D', Manifesta­tion) so as 'to overcome the fact that they
overstayed,' while in the second paragraph of the same Reply, respondent
asserts that the foreign-born minor children of petitioner should not be
considered as Filipino citizens for the alleged reason that at the time of
petitioner's oath-taking as a naturalized Filipino the said children were not
lawfully dwelling in this country;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioner submits and the respondent
concurs, that the Decision of the Board of Special Inquiry dated <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1967</st1:date> has retro­active
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, therefore, the
retroactivity of the admission of petitioner's minor children as Filipino
citizens must be interpreted to have a curative effect and should operate to <span style="">correct and/or
remove any and all defects, if any, relative to the alleged 'overstaying'
status of said children </span><span style="">prior </span><span style="">to or at the time of the oath-taking of the
petitioner as a naturalized Filipino."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1968</st1:date> resolved to deny the dismissal prayed
for by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
Solicitor General thereafter filed on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="10"><span style="">October
 1, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> his <span class="SpellE">surrejoinder</span>, stating that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To clarify matters and remove all possible
doubts on the conditions stated in his Reply to Manifestation, dated September
11, 1968, the statement that the decisions for admission of petitioner's wife
and children to this country 'shall <u>retroact</u> as to <u>overcome</u> the
fact that they <u>overstayed</u> beyond the authorized period of sojourn as
temporary <span style="">visitors'
should be construed to mean that the said decisions for admission to
petitioner's wife and children amounted to and in effect, constituted a <u>waiver</u>
of grounds of exclusion against them for having overstayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the Commissioner waived the grounds
of exclusion against said temporary visi­tors (Sec. 29 <span class="GramE">a(</span>15)
(17), Com. Act No. 613 as amend­ed; <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Hong vs.
Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-10224, </span><st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="5"><span style="">May 11, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the fact that petitioner's minor children
were 'not lawfully dwelling' in this country, being overstaying temporary
visitors, at the time of petitioner's oath taking as a naturalized Filipino
certainly <u>cannot</u> be <u>erased</u> or <u>wiped</u> out by any kind of
legal fiction, and this is the import of the second paragraph of our Reply to
Manifestation, dated September 11, 1968."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner subsequently filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1968</st1:date> a motion to dismiss appeal and/or a
motion to withdraw petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
contended that the issues presented in the instant appeal to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the legality of the continued stay of his
wife as a temporary visitor and the court's ruling of <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> acquisition
of Filipino citizenship of his two foreign born minor children upon his natu­ralization
without proper documentation as such by the Bureau of Immigration have become
moot and academic by virtue of the subsequent acts of respondent commissioner and
his Board of Commissioners admitting his wife as a permanent resident and his
two children as Filipino citizens as above stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with this Court's resolution for respondent's
comment, the Solicitor General filed his comment under date of January 16, 1969
opposing the same on the ground that the case was already deemed submitted for
decision without petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief per the
Court's resolution of October 14, 1967 and that there are remaining question
ripe for judicial determi­nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="1">January 24
 1969</st1:date> accord<span style="">ingly denied
petitioner's motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the records of the present appeal and of the
case below, the Court finds that the subsequent actions of respondent
commissioner and his Board of Commissioners, after the lower court's decision
of December 20, 1965 and pending this appeal, namely, their action of June 27,
1966 granting the readmission on May 15, 1966 of petitioner's wife as a
permanent resident and that of August 3, 1967 granting <span style="">the readmission on June 24, 1967 of petitioner's foreign born minor
children as Filipino citizens, were never involved <span style="">or placed in issue in the case below which involved solely the issue of
their expulsion from the Philippines as then overstay­ing temporary visitors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue of the expulsion as over­staying
temporary visitors of petitioner's wife and two minor children therefore became
moot upon their departure from the </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and their
readmission afterwards under a completely new status as permanent residents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their readmission there­after upon proper
documentation by respondent commissioner is a new matter which cannot properly
be resolved here, since it was not in issue nor litigated at all in the case
before the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as their readmission as permanent residents is concerned,
respondent commissioner, through the Solicitor General's <span class="SpellE">Surrejoinder</span>
of October 1, 1968 expressly acknowledged that he "waived the grounds of
exclusion against said temporary visitors" for having overstayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to respondent commissioner's readmission
and documentation of petitioner's two foreign-born minor children as Filipino
citizens, this obviously cannot be re­solved in the present case but would have
to be threshed out in the appropriate proceeding <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
as intimated by the Solicitor <span style="">General in his above-quoted reply of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="9"><span style="">September 11, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under such circumstances, the issues involved in the present case
have become moot, and not only the present appeal of respondent commissioner
but the case as originally filed should be, as they are hereby, dismissed.</p>
