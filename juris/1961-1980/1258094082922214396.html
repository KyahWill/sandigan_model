				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for review of the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations in its 
case No. 1506-NE'58, denying herein applicants' petition to dispossess 
respondents tenants of their respective landholdings situated in Barrio Sta. 
Clara, Guimba, Nueva Ecija, pursuant to section 50 (a) of Republic Act No. 1199, 
as amended.
<p>Hacienda Esperanza No. 5, with a total area of approximately 1,800 hectares, 
situated in the municipalities of Cuyapo, Guimba and Nampicuan, Nueva Ecija, was 
originally owned by and registered in the names of the late couple Felipe de 
Santos and Conception Vda. de de Santos. Petitioners here and in the court below 
are the surviving children of the deceased spouses. The <i>hacienda</i> is 
occupied by about 380 tenants and managed by Alberto de Santos, one of the 
petitioners. Under the latter's management, unlike that of his late father, 
tenancy disputes became prevalent between the parties. It was only when the 
management agreed to pay reaping expenses, formerly not given to the tenants, 
and stop forced labor and the imposition of fines, that the tenancy relationship 
between them returned to normal, although the undercurrent still continued. Such 
was the situation that prevailed between the parties in-between the years 1942 
and 1953.</p>
<p>With the enactment of Republic Act No. 1199, otherwise known as the 
Agricultural Tenancy Act, the tenants again became more vocal, even militant, in 
clamoring for increased tenancy rights; thus they demanded for a 70-30 sharing 
basis in their favor in lieu of the old 55-45. Under this general condition, 
petitioners, on or about May, 1955, organized a corporation known as De Santos 
Agricultural Development, Incorporated, which was to manage the <i>hacienda</i> 
in question. In December, 1955, the Board of Directors authorized the corporate 
president, Alberto de Santos, to undertake the mechanization of a parcel of land 
situated in Barrio Sta. Clara, Guimba, Nueva Ecija, which parcel is tenanted by 
the respondents herein, numbering 55 in all.</p>
<p>On July 30, 1958, the petitioners petitioned the court <i>a quo</i> to 
dispossess herein respondents-tenants of their landholdings. Attached to the 
petition is the certification, dated February 9, 1955, of the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources, stating, among other things, that 
<i>Hacienda</i> Esperanza No. 5, of which the landholdings of the respondents 
form part, was found suitable for mechanization, that the use of mechanical 
implements will reduce the cost of production by approximately 23 per cent per 
hectare, and that the total labor will be approximately 44 per cent less. The 
proposed mechanization includes plowing, harrowing, leveling, diking and final 
harrowing, which is also known as partial mechanization.</p>
<p>It appears that petitioners are actually in the process of partially 
mechanizing a small portion of the <i>hacienda</i> situated in the barrios of 
Lennec and San Felipe, Guimba, Nueva Ecija, as well as the upper portion 
thereof. As such, petitioners own and possess various types of farm machineries 
adequate to mechanize even the landholdings in question, besides being 
financially able to operate these machineries or to acquire more should they 
become necessary.</p>
<p>Consistently with Republic Act No. 2263, which was approved and took effect 
during the pendency of this case in the court below, petitioners in addition 
presented a certification, dated June 25, 1959, of the Commissioner of the 
Agricultural Tenancy Commission, to the effect that "the records of 
investigation of the certification of suitability for mechanization of the farm 
known as Hacienda No. 5 * * * show that more than 60 per cent of the tenants' 
labor thereat, as provided by paragraph s, section 5 of Republic Act No. 2264 
shall be displaced by farm machinery." Also in keeping with the amendatory 
legislation, petitioners submitted a certification, dated June 25, 1959, issued 
by the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA), that it 
would be able to provide immediate resettlement to the respondents should their 
dispossession be authorized by the court.</p>
<p>The Agrarian Court, nonetheless, denied the move to eject the 
respondents-tenants on the following grounds:</p>
<p>(1) That the petitioners failed to establish their <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> intention to 
cultivate the landholdings of the respondents through the employment of farm 
machinery and implements; and</p>
<p>(2) That the landholdings in question are not suited for mechanization as the 
term is defined and understood under section 50 (a) of Republic Act No. 1199, as 
amended, notwithstanding the certification of suitability issued by the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, as well as the certification of 
the Commissioner, Agricultural Commission.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from must be sustained. Among other things, the law 
requires that there be—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>bona fide</i> intention of the landholder—owner or his relative within 
the first degree of consanguinity to cultivate the land himself personally or 
through the employment of farm machinery and implements * * *." (Sec. 50[a] 
Republic Act No. 1199, as amended)</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether or not there was such a <i>bona fide</i> intention of the landowner 
is largely a question of fact into which this Court cannot inquire unless the 
Agrarian Court's finding in that respect shpuld lack substantial basis in the 
evidence on record.</p>
<p>Here, the records disclose that <i>Hacienda</i> Esperanza No. 5 is bisected 
by a provincial road running from south to north; on the west side is Barrio 
Sta. Clara and on the eastern portion are the barrios of Lenec, San Felipe, 
Guisit, Baloy and Balbalino. The topography of the area is such that on the east 
side, the land is hilly, sloping and rolling, while on the west side, it is 
plain. For this reason, farming by man-animal combinations in the hilly portion 
of the <i>hacienda</i> is not as suitable as on the west side, and produces 
less. Not only does it appear that the eastern sector of the area is suitable 
to mechanized farming, but tfcat indeed a portion thereof (Lenec) already 
underwent mechanization successfully. There was ground, therefore, for the court 
<i>a quo</i> to hold, as it did, that it would have been more in keeping with 
the ordinary course of events if the proposed mechanization were merely extended 
to this hilly and rolling portion of the <i>hacienda,</i> which is anyway 
contiguous to the area already mechanized. It was incumbent upon appellants to 
satisfy the Court with their reasons for disregarding this contiguity (other 
than their desire to oust the west side tenants), and in this they have 
failed.</p>
<p>Managerial discretion should, it is true, be conceded to the landowner, and 
it would ordinarily be his prerogative to decide what portions of his land 
should be mechanized. But the <i>bona fide</i> exercise thereof can be tested to 
determine if it conforms to legislative measures enacted pursuant to the police 
power of the State. One of these enactments is Section 50 (a) of Republic Act 
No. 1199, as amended.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, the Agrarian Court assigned two main reasons to the 
petitioners' insistence to oust the respondents from their respective 
landholdings, to wit: (1) that the respondents are on a 70-30 sharing basis 
while those on the opposite landholdings are only on a 55-45 ratio; and (2) that 
the respondents, in contrast with their counterparts on the eastern portion of 
the <i>hacienda</i>, are definitely more militant in their agitations for better 
tenancy treatment. These findings are supported by the absence of a definite 
plan for the mechanization of the entire <i>hacienda</i> and by testimony on 
record that the landowners tried in earnest to convince the respondents to 
return to the old 45-55 sharing basis, but that this proposal was turned 
down.</p>
<p>The petitioners incorrectly argue that the phrase "<i>bona fide</i> intention 
to cultivate" has reference only to (1) the ability of the landowner to 
mechanize and (2) a firm decision on his part to mechanize. The contention not 
only unduly narrows the statutory condition, which in our considered opinion 
requires further that the landowner be not motivated by vindictiveness in 
seeking the dispossession of his tenants, but it also unjustly endangers the 
position of agitating tenants under a retaliatory landowner, a wrong that has 
long been the object of our agrarian reforms. The "<i>bona fide</i>" requirement 
necessarily authorizes judicial inquiry into the landowner's motives in deciding 
to mechanize his operations. Nor do we find that a statutory presumption of bad 
faith, if the landowner fails to mechanize after five years, is at all 
incompatible with an inquiry into the good faith of a proposed mechanization 
before it is carried out.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the foregoing conclusion, we consider it irrelevant whether 
the certifications of the Agricultural Tenancy Commission are to be deemed 
conclusive or merely <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the <i>hacienda's</i> 
suitability to mechanization. In either case, it would first be necessary to 
prove the <i>bona fide</i> intention of the landowners-petitioners to cultivate 
the landholdings in question.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
petitioners.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
