				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question raised in this petition is whether the municipal
court of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
can be considered a court of record under Sections 45, 75, and 77 of the
Judiciary Act (Republic Act No. 296), as amended by Republic Act No. 6031.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> is the only duly appointed clerk-stenographer in
the <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> Municipal Court (p. 6 of Answer, p. 44,
rec.; Annex "2" of Answer, p. 47, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Luzano</span> is the complaining witness in the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charge involving the amount of P150.00, which he
filed against private respondent <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> and was docketed as Criminal Case No. 1087 in the
municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> (Annex "A", p. 6,
rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire proceedings in the
municipal court were taken down by said clerk-stenographer <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, which is affirmed by the petitioner (see
pars. 3 and 6 of the Petition, p. 2, rec.), admitted by respondent <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> (see p. 6 of his
Answer, p. 44, rec.), confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> herself in her sworn statement (Annex
"2" of the Answer, p. 47, rec.), and certified to by Acting <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> Municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> D.
<span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> (Annex "3" of Answer, p. 48,
rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the trial, respondent <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> was convicted
and sentenced accordingly, from which judgment he appealed to the Court of
First Instance presided by the respondent Judge Honorable <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span>
Romero before whom he pleaded not guilty to the charge when arraigned on <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, trial <u>de novo</u> was set for <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1970</st1:date> and reset for <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a motion dated October 21, 1970 praying that the
case be decided on the basis of the evidence and records submitted by the
municipal court on the basis of the ground that since the appealed case falls
within the original exclusive jurisdiction of the municipal court (Sec. 87(b-3),
R.A. No. 296 as amended), the same is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> only
to the Court of First Instance, which shall decide the case on the basis of the
evidence and records transmitted from the municipal court under Sec. 45 of
Republic Act No. 296, as amended by Republic Act. No. 6031 and should not be
tried <u>de novo</u>, because the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>
is a court of record (Annex "E", pp. 13-16, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge granted the motion in an
order dated <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1970</st1:date>
setting aside the trial <u>de novo</u> (annex "F", pp. 17-18,
rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the promulgation of
the decision was set for <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="1">January 28,
 1971</st1:date>, but, upon motion of the accused, was reset for <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1971</st1:date> (Annexes
"G" &amp; "H", pp. 19-20, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in an order dated February 1, 1971, respondent Judge
issued an order re-setting the arraignment of the accused and the trial <u>de
novo</u> on February 17<i>, </i>1971, on the ground that he was informed by the
Undersecretary of Justice that the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>
is not a court of record (Annex "I", p. 21, rec.), because Department
of Justice Circular No. 12 of February 10, 1970, construing Sections 45, 75 and
77 of the Judiciary Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 6031, states that a
city or muni­cipal court, to be a court of record, must have a clerk of court,
two stenographers and an interpreter under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 6031
amending paragraph 2 of Section 75 of Republic Act No. 296.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
entertains the same view (pp. 28-29, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent Judge reiterated his opinion in an order dated <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1971</st1:date> denying petitioner's
motion for reconsideration of the order dated <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1971</st1:date> (Annex "K", p. 26, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The position of the respondents cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 6031 read thus:</p>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

city judge, stating clearly the facts and the law on which they are based,
signed by him, and filed with the clerk of court.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx x xx x xx x " (underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The over-riding purpose of Republic Act No. 6031 is to accelerate
the administration of justice by eliminating trial <u>de novo</u> in the Court
of First Instance of cases appealed from municipal and city courts thru the
conversion into courts of record of the city and municipal courts, whose
proceedings have been fully recorded by a qualified stenographer (Vol. IV,
Cong. Rec., No. 64, p. 3202, May 13, 1969).</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 2 of Section 75 of the Judiciary Act, as amended by
Republic Act No. 6031, directing that "in other municipalities, the
municipal judge shall have a clerk of court, two stenographers, and other minor
personnel as the service may require," provides for the ideal complement
of a municipal court as a court of record, when government finances
permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant to note that
the law does not specifically mention the interpreter as essential to complete
the desired staffing pattern of a municipal court as a court of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interpreter is however included in the ge­neric
phrase "other minor personnel as the service may require" -­- but only
when demanded by the exigencies of the service, as is patent from the
provision, and not always.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
Circular No. 12 of the Department of Justice dated <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1970</st1:date>, does not inter­pret or
implement faithfully the aforementioned law; because it requires that the
municipal court must at all times have an interpreter in order that it may be
considered a court of record.</p>

<p class="BODY">The clear legislative intent is that as long as the muni­cipal or
city court has a qualified stenographer to record its proceedings, it is a
court of record from the time Republic Act No. 6031 took effect on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The congressional record discloses such
intention thus:</p>

<blockquote>"xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this bill, Your Honor, the lower courts
-- I refer to city and municipal courts -- will become courts of records.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When will this bill take effect?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a provision here to that effect, Mr.
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5 on page 4 provides
that the bill will take effect upon its approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xx x xx x xx x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This bill becomes effective when signed by
the President into law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppose this bill is signed on May 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we will have only until June 22, more or
less.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But by June 22 our municipal courts,</u>
and there are hundreds of them, <u>will not be staffed with the necessary
stenographers</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have gone to many
places, Your Honor, and have seen that <u>there are plenty of municipal courts
where the clerks are not stenographers</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not have type­writers, they do not
have ribbons, they do not have bond paper, they do not have clips.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been to several municipalities where
the <u>judges write their decisions in long hand because they have</u> no
secretaries, no clerks, <u>no stenographers</u>, no typewriters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of them do not even write their decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They just make oral, verbal decisions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is worse, Your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But considering the enforce­ability of the
law or its implementation or <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> on June 22,
yet here we are pro­viding that the city or municipal court will become a court
of record.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>How could that be when there are no
stenographers?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By that time I am sure we
will not be able to provide stenographers in all of these courts</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That will be a matter of implementation
already, Your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be up to
the Department of Justice to implement the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course that is true, Your Honor, but when
the law says it is effective immediately and we, there­fore, eliminate trial <u>de
novo</u> from the approval of the law, that means <u>from the approval of the
law the lower courts become courts of record</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is right, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But how will they become courts of record</u>
when they have no records, <u>when they have no stenographers to make the
records</u>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ask this question because
it is very possible that one of the adversaries or one of the attorneys may
raise it for the court to decide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is very possible, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They will say, ‘Well, the court of first
instance will decide this case in accordance with the records submitted from
the city or municipal court.' <u>But there is no record; no stenographer</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will b<i>e</i> up to the Department of
Justice to move fast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not think they can move fast in 30
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>There are hundreds of
municipalities which do not have stenographers</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact municipal courts are not
courts of record until now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Ninety-eight
percent of the municipalities do not have steno­graphers</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor knows that because he has been
around the country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I am only trying
to help find a way whereby we can implement this bill when approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are handicaps to be met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Ninety-eight per cent of our municipal
courts are not courts of record.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>They
do not have stenographers.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, there will be an interregnum, Mr.
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, from the time this
bill is actually signed into law by the President up to the time it is actually
implemented by the executive department, there will be an interregnum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor's point is very well taken on that
particular phase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During this period of
the organization of the municipal court into a court of record, it would be
very difficult to carry out the provisions of this law into effect to the
letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Is it the sug­gestion<i> </i>of
Your Honor to make this effective upon the furnishing of the necessary
personnel</u>?<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator GANZON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>I will say that, or else make a provision
in the bill when these municipal courts without stenographers will have to
comply</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than leave this to the Department of
Justice, we shall make this provision applicable when there is complete
personnel already.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator LAUREL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>We will accept that suggestion</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Vol. IV,
Congressional Record, No. 64, pp. 3202-03, May 13, 1969, underlining supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise clear from the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
portions of the congressional record that the municipal courts became courts of
record from the approval on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="8">August 4,
 1969</st1:date> of the amendatory law, Republic Act No. 6031.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, with respect to a city or municipal court, which was
still without the desired personnel at the time of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the amendment on August 4, 1969, upon the suggestion of Sena­tors Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Canzon</span>, as <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>, the amendment incorporated in paragraph 2 of
Section 45 of the Judiciary Act the following proviso:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Provided, however, that if the case was
tried in a city or municipal court before the latter became a court of record,
then on appeal, the case shall proceed by trial <u>de novo</u>." (Vol. IV,
Congressional Record, No. 64, pp. 3203-04, May 13, 1969; Vol. IV, No. 699, p.
4265, May 19, 1969.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, because the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>
has a clerk-stenographer since before <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="8">August
 4, 1969</st1:date>, it became a court of record within the purview of Republic
Act No. 6031 as of <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1969</st1:date>,
even if it has no interpreter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that the trial of the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
case against the herein private respondent in the <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>
municipal court might have commence in June, 1969, before Republic Act No. 6031
took effect on August 4, 1969, does not render necessary a trial <u>de novo</u>
under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> proviso in paragraph 2 of
Section 45 of the Judiciary Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 6031; because
the fact remains that the trial of said case was continued and terminated long
after August 4, 1969, with the entire proceedings fully recorded by the lone
but qualified clerk-stenographer, and was decided on June 3, 1970 (Annex
"A", pp. 6-11, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of private respondent that the stenographic notes and
translation of the testimonies of the witnesses are inaccurate, does not invite
belief; because he did not make such assertion before the respondent Judge,
despite the fact that the private prosecutor repeatedly stated that the
proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> municipal court were fully
recorded by the clerk-stenographer in his motion dated October 21, 1970 to
decide the case based on the evidence and records submitted by the municipal
court (Annex "E", pp. 14-16, rec.) and in his motion for the
reconsideration of the order of the respondent Judge dated February 1, 1971
setting the trial <u>de novo</u> of the appealed case (Annex "J", pp.
22-25, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Judge, in
his order dated February 1, 1971 setting the hearing <u>de novo</u> of the case
(Annex "I", p. 21, rec.) and his order dated February 8, 1971 denying
the motion of the private prosecutor for the reconsid­eration of the order
dated February 1, 1971 (Annex "K", p. 26, rec.), did not in any way
insinuate or intimate that the private respondent herein challenged the
accuracy or integrity of the records taken by the clerk-stenographer of the
proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in his Answer to the petition
before this Court that the private respondent, for the first time,
categorically impugns the correctness of the steno­graphic notes and the
translation of the testimonies as taken down by the clerk-stenographer of the <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the private respondent herein doubted the accuracy of the
stenographic notes and of the translation of the testimonies of the witnesses,
he must have made the corresponding objections during and after the trial in
the municipal court and before the municipal judge could render a decision, and
his objections should accordingly appear of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, such inaccu­racies, even if
conceded, will not impair the character of the municipal court as a court of
record; because such inaccuracies at times also obtain in the stenographic
notes and records of the courts of first instance, which do not thereby cease
to be courts of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, such
mistakes, if any, may still be corrected upon proper motion <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
before the respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential feature of a court of record under existing
jurisprudence is that it is "a court that is bound to keep a record of its
proceedings";<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which is required expressly by para­graph 2 of Section 77 of the Judiciary Act,
as amended by Repub­lic Act No. 6031; or its "proceedings is perpetuated
in writing by some duly authorized persons"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
as was done in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even when there is no duly appointed court stenographer, the
proceedings can still be recorded by a competent stenographer duly designated by
the Judge or upon agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This happens occasionally even in the court of first instance when the
regular court stenographers have not been appointed as yet or are absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stenographer so designated with the
consent or acquiescence of the parties is a <u>de facto</u> employee whose acts
are valid in so far as the public and third persons are concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The requirement that to be a court of record, a muni­cipal or
city court must have a clerk of court, two stenographers and other minor personnel
as the service may require, is cer­tainly not jurisdictional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the absence of a duly appointed
clerk of court or stenographer or other minor employees will not divest the
municipal or city court of jurisdiction to try the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither will the absence of such employees in
the muni­cipal or city court deprive the court of first instance of its appel­late
jurisdiction to decide such appealed cases on the basis of the records and
evidence submitted in the municipal or city court as long as the proceedings
have been fully recorded by a qual­ified stenographer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the contention of the respondents were to
be upheld, the court of first instance with only one duly appointed
stenographer or a stenographer not pertaining to the said court of first
instance or not duly appointed but designated upon agreement of the parties,
would be reduced to a court <u>not</u> of record and consequently would deny
the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court jurisdiction to review cases
appealed from the court of first instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The view of respondents would paralyze the administration of
justice; because a trial court with only one stenographer cannot <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> legally proceed with the, trial of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the written decision promulgated by the
municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> in this case is valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It complies with the requirements of Section
77, paragraph 2 of Republic Act No. 6031 and of Section 2 of Rule 120, Revised
Rules of Court, as to form and content and discusses the evidence of both the
pro­secution and the defense, including reference to the stenographic notes
taken of the testimonial evidence by the lone but duly appointed stenographer
of the <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise conceded that the offense of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> involving P150.00 of which the accused was
convicted, is within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the municipal court
of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, that the jurisdiction over the person of
the accused was properly acquired, and that trial was held with due notice to
the accused and his counsel, who were both present during the entire
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders of the respondent Judge dated
February 1, 1971 and February 8, 1971 are hereby set aside as null and void,
and the respondent Judge is hereby directed to decide Criminal Case No. 76
