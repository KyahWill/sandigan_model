<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In their petition for certiorari 
and prohibition, Benjamin, <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span>, Fabian and 
Vicente all surnamed Garcia, pray that respondent Hon. <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>, be ordered, as 
Judge of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to desist from 
further proceeding in Land Registration Case No. 765, G.L.R.O. Record No. 18485, 
of said Court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record shows that, on October 
18, 1918, respondent Pedro de Guzman instituted said proceeding for the 
registration, in his name, of a tract ,of land situated in the municipality of 
San Carlos, province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>; that, on January 
30, 1923, judgment was rendered in said proceeding as prayed for by De Guzman; 
that on July 18, 1923, Original Certificate of Title No. 25381 was, accordingly, 
issued In his favor; that on March 24, 1959, herein petitioners instituted Civil 
Case No. 13847-II of said court, against De Guzman, for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the aforementioned land in favor of herein 
petitioners; that on April 4, 1959, De Guzman moved to dismiss said case No. 
13847-II upon the ground that the same is barred by the judgment rendered in 
Land Registration Case No. 765, that petitioners have no cause of action and 
that the alleged light of said petitioners and their action based thereon are 
barred by the statute of limitations; that on April 27,1959, said motion to 
dismiss was granted; that, on appeal taken by herein petitioners, the case was 
docketed in the Supreme Court as G. R. No. L-15988; that on September 1, 1959, 
respondent Judge had authorized, in said land registration case, the issuance of 
a writ of possession in favor of De Guzman; that this writ of possession was 
not, however, executed, owing to the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of said 
appeal in the Supreme Court; that the latter rendered, on August 30, l962, a 
decision affirming the order of dismissal appealed from; that soon thereafter, 
or on December 29, 1962, respondent De Guzman reiterated in the aforementioned 
land registration case, his motion for issuance of a writ of possession in his 
favor; that on January 2, 1963, petitioners herein objected to said motion of De 
Guzman, which was granted by<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>respondent judge on February 2, 1963; and 
that, accordingly, on June 4, 1963, petitioners herein instituted the present 
original action for certiorari and prohibition to restrain respondent Judge from 
enforcing said writ of execution and further proceeding in said case, upon the 
ground that the decision rendered in the land registration case is not binding 
upon them because they were not parties therein and because they had taken 
possession of the land in question after the rendition of said decision. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petition herein is patently 
devoid of merit. To begin with, a land registration case is a proceeding <i>in 
<span class="SpellE">rem</span></i>, and, accordingly, the decision therein 
rendered is binding upon the whole world (<span class="SpellE">Soroñgon</span> vs. 
<span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> et al. 80 Phil. 259). Secondly, in civil 
case No. 13847-II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, petitioners herein sought to compel De Guzman to 
<span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the land in question upon the theory that the 
decree of registration thereof in his name was based upon a deed of donation 
dated June 1, 1918 which had been fraudulently secured by De Guzman from Juan 
Garcia, the father of petitioners herein, who, allegedly, were in possession of 
said land, at that time, and remained continuously in possession thereof. Apart 
from the fact that petitioners' complaint in said case indicated that 
petitioners were in possession of said land prior to and at the time of the 
institution of the land registration <span class="SpellE">proceedings—thus</span> 
refuting their allegation in the present case to the effect that the decision in 
the land registration case does not bind them because their possession is 
subsequent to said <span class="SpellE">decision—the</span> trial court, whose 
decision was affirmed by this Court, held that the alleged fraud in the 
execution of the aforementioned deed of donation had been disapproved by the 
fact that, although petitioners' father Juan Garcia, did not die until 1950, or 
thirty-two (32) years after the execution of said deed, he neither sought to 
annul the same nor opposed De Guzman's petition for the registration of the land 
in question in his name. Lastly, it was held in said case No.13847-11 of the 
lower court and G.R. No. L-15988 of this Court that the decree of land 
registration in favor of De Guzman bars the claim of petitioners herein. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the petition herein is, 
accordingly, dismissed, with costs against the petitioners. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">SO ORDERED</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Reyes,
