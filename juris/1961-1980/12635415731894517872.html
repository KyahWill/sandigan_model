Civil Case 
No. 1) dismissing the petition for mandamus or recounting of votes filed by 
<span class="SpellE">Recaredo</span> B. Castillo et al., against the Provincial 
Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and the respective municipal Board of canvassers for the 
municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Tago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tamlag</span>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Cagwait</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maribatag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Oteiza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barobo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Lingig</span> in <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>. Insofar as pertinent to this proceeding, the facts are 
as follows:</p>
<p>At the start of the canvass by the Provincial Board of Canvassers of the 
returns of the general elections held on November 12, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Recaredo</span> B. Castillo and others, candidates for the 
positions of governor, vice-governor, and provincial board members of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and the municipal 
positions in the municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Tandag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tago</span>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Marihatag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagwait</span>, <span class="SpellE">Oteiza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lingig</span>, same province, 
filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> to compel the 
respondents provincial and municipal boards of canvassers to recount the votes 
cast in all the precincts of the named municipalities, on the ground that the 
election returns <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> were dictated by armed 
bands and constabulary soldiers, and that votes cast for petitioners were read 
and counted by the election inspectors in favor of their opponents, candidates 
of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>In their respective answers to the petition, the Provincial Board of 
Canvassers set up, among others, the defense of lack of cause of action; while 
the municipal board of canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Tago</span> alleged 
that, there having been a proclamation of the elected officials for said 
municipality on <st1:date month="11" day="18" year="1963">November 18, 
1963</st1:date>, said body had already become <span class="SpellE"><em>functus</em></span><em> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.</em> 
The respondent municipal board of canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Oteiza</span> 
claimed that, it being a new municipality, the canvass of the election returns 
from <span class="SpellE">Oteiza</span> would be undertaken by the provincial 
board of canvassers as provided by law.</p>
<p>There being no writ of preliminary injunction issued by the court<span class="GramE">,<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">1]</span></sup>the canvass of the election returns proceeded. 
In the course of such partial canvass, certain discrepancies between the returns 
and tally sheets in certain precincts were alleged to have been noted. Thus, on 
<st1:date month="12" day="2" year="1663">December 2, 1663</st1:date>, 
petitioners filed a supplemental petition specially pointing out such 
discrepancies, involving Precinct No. 5 of <span class="SpellE">Tago</span>, and 
Precincts Nos. 26 and 12 of <span class="SpellE">Cantilan</span>, which were not 
originally included in the petition, and which discrepancies allegedly would 
affect the result of the election.</p>
<p>In fact, the petition for preliminary injunction was actually withdrawn by 
the petitioners themselves on <st1:date month="12" day="5" year="1903">December 
5, 1903</st1:date>.</p>
<p>After hearing the matter of absence of cause of action set up by the 
respondent Provincial Board of Canvassers, the court, in its order of December 
9, 1963, dismissed the petition, on the ground that although the employment of 
force and intimidation resulting in falsification of an election return could be 
the basis of a recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code, because 
in such instance it would be as if there has been no return for said precinct, 
yet in the present case, such irregularity has not been shown to exist. It was 
also pointed out that the original petition failed to show by specific figures, 
the difference in votes produced by the alleged employment of armed bands and 
perpetration of fraud, which could have materially affected the result of the 
election. Furthermore, the action was declared improperly directed against the 
board of canvassers which under the Revised Election Code have no authority to 
conduct a recount of the <span class="GramE">votes,</span> the said authority 
properly belonged only to the court of first instance. As a consequence of the 
aforesaid dismissal of the petition for recount, the canvass of the returns was 
continued and the elected candidates were proclaimed on <st1:date month="12" day="14" year="1963">December 14, 1963</st1:date>. These proclaimed winners, 
accordingly, took their oath of office on <st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1964">January 1, 1964</st1:date> <span class="GramE">Upon</span> the other 
hand, petitioners <span class="SpellE">Recaredo</span> Castillo, et al. appealed 
the order of dismissal of the petition for recount to this Court.</p>
<p>It is evident from the nature of this case that the present appeal will no 
longer serve the original purpose for which the petition was filed in the lower 
court. Proclamation of the declared winners having been made and the latter 
having already started discharging the functions of their respective offices, 
the remedy left to petitioners is only to contest their election. And this 
remedy was already availed of specifically by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Recaredo</span> B. Castillo, whose protest against the proclamation 
of <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> <span class="SpellE">Serra</span> <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>, as governor-elect of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> 
<span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, is pending 
resolution of the Court of First Instance of said province (Civil Case No. 26, 
Elec. Case No. 2). It is clear, therefore, that this appeal has already become 
moot and academic. The Court's authority to review, revise, reverse, modify, or 
affirm final judgments or decrees of the lower courts is understood to refer to 
the determination of live, <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> issues for the 
purpose of settling or putting an end to the controversy between the parties, in 
a particular case.</p>
<p>This is a new petition for mandamus, filed by <span class="SpellE">Recaredo</span> B. Castillo, as protestant in Civil Case No. 26, 
Election Case No. 2 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, to compel the 
respondent Judge to continue with the revision or examination of the contested 
ballots subject of said proceedings.</p>
<p>It was alleged that in the course of the proceeding in said election protest, 
and after the parties had appointed their respective commissioners preparatory 
to the revision and recounting of the ballots, respondent Judge issued an order 
dated November 21, 1964, restraining the commissioners from setting a date for 
such revision and recounting of ballots, until the appeal from the order of 
dismissal of Election Case No. 1 (G.R. No. L-22765, Castillo, et al. vs. 
Provincial Board of Canvassers, et al.) <span class="GramE">has</span> been 
finally decided or withdrawn by the protestant, allegedly to forestall the 
possibility of duplicating the commissioners' work.</p>
<p>In view of the conclusion we have reached in G.R. No. L-22765, the 
proceedings in Election Case No. 2 must now proceed until the contest therein is 
finally terminated.</p>
<p><span class="GramE"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal in G. R. No.</span> L-22765 is 
(hereby dismissed for being moot and academic. And since the reason given by the 
respondent Judge in G. R. No. L-24038 for not proceeding with the election 
protest no longer <span class="GramE">exists,</span> the petition for mandamus is 
likewise dismissed. No costs in both cases.</p>
