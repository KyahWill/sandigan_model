issuance of a writ of possession in a land registration case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> in
its decision </span>of January 16, 1959 ordered the registration of a one-half <span class="SpellE"><u>proindiviso</u></span> share of Lot 2541 of the <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
cadastre in favor of Maria Lucas, a widow, and the other one-half <span class="SpellE"><u>proindiviso</u></span> share in favor of her six children named
<span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amadea</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>, all
surnamed Coloma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It directed the
issuance of the corresponding decree and title after <span style="">the finality of the decision and the payment of the realty taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cadastral Case No. 22, G.L.R.O. Record No.
400).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From that decision, Manuela T. Lucas and the spouses Jesus T.
Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> Domingo appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1964</st1:date> affirmed the lower court's judgment
(CA-G.R. No. 25252-R, 5 CAR 1250).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition for <span style="">the review of the decision
of the Court of Appeals was dismissed by this Court in its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="5"><span style="">May 6,
 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> in L-22593,
Garcia vs. Coloma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the record was returned to the lower court, the <span class="SpellE">Colomas</span> filed a motion dated <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1965</st1:date> for a writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that the decision adjudicating <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2541 to them and their mother had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and that the lot was in the possession of the Garcia spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Garcia spouses filed a petition dated <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1965</st1:date> for the review of the
decision on the ground of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Colomas</span> opposed the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the <span class="SpellE">Colomas</span> was later
confined to Lots 2541-B and 2541-C, two of the three subdivision lots composing
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2541.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
third subdivision lot, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2541-A, was adjudicated to
the Philippine National Railways on <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="2">February
 7, 1967</st1:date> (p. 57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of October 21, 1966 denied the
petition for review but suspended action on the petition for a writ of
possession because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> claim for Lot 2541-A.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Presumably, that claim suspended also the issuance of the decree and
title.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In denying the petition for review, the lower court reasoned out
that the issues involved in the alleged fraud were resolved in its decision and
could no longer be re-litigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> appealed to this Court from the order of denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of that appeal,
the lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="7">July
 11, 1967</st1:date> denied the petition for a writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That order is being assailed in this <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> case which was filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is relevant to state
that the appeal of the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> was dismissed by this
Court in its resolution of February 5, 1968 in L-28041, Director of Lands vs.
Coloma; Jesus T. Garcia, et al., claimants-petitioners and appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was dismissed because the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> did not comply with the material data rule found in
section 6, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dismissal of the appeal became final on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="6"><span style="">June 26, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span>'
appeal, which signified that the lower court's denial of their petition for
review on the ground of fraud had become final, the lower court's refusal to
issue the writ of possession has no more leg to stand on or has become
baseless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the writ of
possession should now be issued in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Colomas</span>
and against the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power of the Court of First Instance to issue a writ of
possession in a land registration case is sanctioned by the generally accepted
principles for the pragmatic administration of justice and by section 5 of Act
No. 1108 and section 3 of Act No. 1680, amending section 17 of Act No. 496, in
relation to section 10 of Act No. 2347 and section 8(d), Rule 39 and sections
5(c) and 6, Rule 135 of the Rules of Court (<span class="SpellE">Romasanta</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Platon</span>, 62 Phil. 857, 858).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The judgment in a land
registration case adjudicating ownership to a person impliedly carries with it
the delivery of possession, if he is deprived thereof, because the right of possession
is inherent in that of ownership (<span class="SpellE">Romasanta</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Platon</span>, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Abulocion</span>
vs. CFI of Iloilo, 100 Phil. 554).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the duty of the registration court to issue the writ of
possession when asked for by the successful claimant (<span class="SpellE">Demorar</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Iba√±ez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Poras</span>, 97
Phil. 72).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And pending appeal from a
decision granting an application for registration, the trial court, for special
reasons, may issue a writ of possession to the winning party in accordance with
section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, now section 2, Rule 39 of the Rules
of Court (Director of Lands vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
51 Phil. 805; <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
31 Phil. 176, 179).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1967</st1:date> is reversed and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is directed to issue the corresponding
writ of possession sought by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>
