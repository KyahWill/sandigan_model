by the herein plaintiff-appellant, Pedro J. Velasco (petitioner in L-14035;
respondent in L-13992)<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch, in its Civil Case No. 1355,
absolving the defendants from a complaint for the abate­ment of the sub-station
as a nuisance and for damages to his health and business in the amount of
P487,600.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1948, appellant Velasco bought from the People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing Corporation three (3) adjoining lots
situated at the corner of South D and South 6 Streets, <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These lots are within an area zoned out as a
"first residence" district by the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the appellant sold
two (2) lots to the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>, but retained the third
lot, which was farthest from the street-corner, whereon he built his house.</p>

<p class="BODY">In September, 1953, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
company started the construction of the sub-station in question and finished it
the following November, without prior building permit or authority from the
Public Service Commission (vs. <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> vs. Public
Service Commission, 109 Phil. 603).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
facility reduces high voltage electricity to a current suitable for
distribution to the company's consumers, num­bering not less than 8,500
residential homes, over 300 commercial establishments and about 30 industries
(T. s. n., 19 October 1959, page 1765).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The substation has a rated capacity of "2 transformers at 5000 <span class="SpellE">Kva</span> each or a total of 10,000 <span class="SpellE">Kva</span>
without fan cooling; or 6250 <span class="SpellE">Kva</span> each or a total of
12,500 <span class="SpellE">Kva</span> with fan cooling" (Exhibit
"A-3").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was constructed at
a distance of 10 to 20 meters from the ap­pellant's house (T. s. n., 16 July
1956, page 62; 19 December 1956, page 343; 1 June 1959, page 29).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company built a stone and cement wall at
the sides along the streets but along the side adjoining the appellant's
property it put up a <span class="SpellE">sawale</span> wall but later changed it
to an interlink wire fence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that a sound unceasingly emanates from the
substation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether this sound
constitutes an action­able nuisance or not is the principal issue in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant Velasco contends that the sound constitutes
an actionable nuisance under.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
694 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A nuisance is any act, omission, es­tablishment,
business, condition of pro­perty or anything else which:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">because subjection to the sound since
1954 had disturbed the concentration and sleep of said appellant, and impaired
his health and lowered the value of his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where­fore, he sought a judicial decree for
the abatement of the nuisance and asked that he be declared entitled to recover
compensatory, moral and other damages under Article 2202 of the Civil Code.</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 2202.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In crimes
and quasi?<span class="SpellE">delicts</span>, the defendant shall be
liable for all damages which are the natural and probable consequences of the
act or omission complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
ne­cessary that such damages have been fore­seen or could have reasonably been
foreseen by the defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, as already observed, the court below dismissed the
claim of the plaintiff, finding that the sound of the substation was unavoidable
and did not constitute nuisance; that it could not have caused the diseases of
anxiety neurosis, <span class="SpellE">pyeIonephritis</span>, <span class="SpellE">ureteritis</span>,
lumbago and anemia; and that the items of damage claimed by plaintiff were not
adequately proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff then appealed
to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that everyone is bound to bear the habitual
or customary inconveniences that result from the proximity of others, and so
long as this level is not surpassed, he may not complain against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if the prejudice exceeds the
inconveniences that such proximity habitually brings, the neighbor who causes
such disturbance is held responsible for the resulting damage<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
being guilty of causing nuisance.</p>

<p class="BODY">While no previous adjudications on the specific issue have been
made in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
our law of nuisances is of American origin, and a review of authorities clearly
in­dicates the rule to be that the causing or maintenance of disturbing noise
or sound may constitute an actionable nui­sance (V. Ed. Note, 23 ALR, 2d 1289).
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>The basic principles are laid down in <span class="SpellE">Tortorella</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Traiser</span> &amp; Co.,
Inc. 90 ALR 1206:</p>

<p class="BODY">With particular reference to noise emanating from electrical
machinery and appliances, the court, in Kentucky &amp; West Virginia Power Co.
v. Anderson, 156 S. W. 2d 857, after a review of authorities, ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"There can be no doubt but that commercial and industrial
activities which are lawful in themselves may become nuisances if they are so
offensive to the senses that they render the enjoyment of life and property
uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no defense that
skill and care have been exercised and the most improved methods and appliances
employed to prevent such result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wheat

R. C. L. 438; Annotations, 23 A. L. R. 1407; 90 A. L. R. 1207.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the creation of trifling annoyance
and inconvenience does not constitute an actionable nuisance, and the locality
and surroundings are of im­portance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that the cause of the complaint must be substantial has often led to
expressions in the opinions that to be a nuisance the noise must be deafening
or loud or excessive and un­reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Usually it was shown to be of that character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">determinating</span>
factor when noise alone is the cause of complaint is not its intensity or
volume.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is that the noise is of such
character as to produce actual physical discomfort and annoyance to a person of
ordinary sensibilities, rendering adjacent property less comfortable and
valuable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the noise does that it can
well be said to be substantial and unreasonable in degree; and reasonableness
is a question of fact dependent upon all the circumstances and conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>20 R. C. L. 445, 453; Wheat Culvert Company
v. Jenkins, supra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no fixed
standard as to what kind of noise constitutes a nuisance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true some witnesses in this case say
they have been annoyed by the humming of these transformers, but that fact is
not con­clusive as to the non-existence of the cause of complaint, the test
being the effect which is had upon an ordinary person who is neither sensitive
nor immune to the annoy­ance concerning which the complaint is made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of evidence that the com­plainant
and his family are supersensitive to distracting noises, it is to be assumed
that they are persons of ordinary and normal sensibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Roukovina</span> v. Island

<blockquote>In Wheat Culvert Company vs. Jenkins, supra, we held an injunction
was properly decreed to stop the noise from the operation of a metal culvert
factory at night which interfered with the sleep of the occupants of an
adjacent residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true the
clanging, riveting and hammering of metal plates produces a sound different in
charac­ter from the steady hum or buzz of the elec­tric machinery described in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Jenkins case the noise
was loud, dis­cordant and intermittent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here it is inter­minable and monotonous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therein lies the physical annoyance and disturbance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though the noise be harmonious and slight and
trivial in itself, the constant and monotonous sound of a cricket on the
hearth, or the drip of a leaking faucet is irritating, uncomfortable,
distracting and disturbing to the average man and woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is that the intolerable, steady
monotony of this ceaseless sound, loud enough to inter­fere with ordinary
conversation in the dwelling, produces a result generally deemed sufficient to
constitute the cause of it an actionable nuisance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held the continuous and
monotonous playing of a phonograph for advertising purposes on the street even
though there were various records, singing, speaking and instrumental, injuriously
affected plaintiff's employees by a gradual wear on their nervous systems, and
otherwise, is a nuisance authorizing an injunction and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frank F. <span class="SpellE">Stodder</span> et

<p class="BODY">The principles thus laid down make it readily ap­parent that
inquiry must be directed at the character and intensity of the noise generated
by the particular substation of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As can be anticipated, charac­ter and
loudness of sound being of subjective appreciation in ordinary witnesses, not
much help can be obtained from the testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That of plaintiff Velasco is too plainly
biased and emotional to be of much value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His exaggerations are readily apparent in paragraph V of his amended
complaint, signed by him as well as his counsel, wherein the noise complained
of as ?</p>

<blockquote>"fearful hazardous noise and clangor
are produced by the said electric trans­former of the <span class="SpellE">MEC's</span>
substation, approxi­mating a noise of a reactivated about-to-explode volcano,
perhaps like the nerve wracking noise of the torture chamber in Germany's <span class="SpellE">Dachau</span> or <span class="SpellE">Buchenwald</span>"

tree, it was 52 decibels; outside but close to the concrete wall, the readings
were 42 to 43 decibels; and near the transformers, it was 76 decibels (Exhibit

superinten­dent <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>), appear more reliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion must be that, contrary to the
finding of the trial court, the noise continuously emitted, day and night,
constitutes an actionable nuisance for which the appellant is en­titled to
relief, by requiring the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> company to adopt
the necessary measures to deaden or reduce the sound at the plaintiff's house,
by replacing the interlink wire fence with a partition made of sound ab­sorbent
material, since the relocation of the substation is manifestly impracticable
and would be prejudicial to the customers of the Electric Company who are being
serviced from the substation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> company insists that as the
plaintiff's own evidence (Exhibit "NN-7(c)") the intensity of the
sound (as measured by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Almonte</span>) inside appellant's
house is only 46 to 47 decibels at the consultation room, and 43 to 45 decibels
within the treatment room, the appel­lant had no ground to complain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is not meritorious, because the
noise at the bedrooms was deter­mined to be around 64-65 decibels, and the
medical evidence is to the effect that the basic root of the appellant's
ailments was his inability to sleep due to the incessant noise with consequent
irritation, thus weakening his cons­titution and making him easy prey to
pathogenic germs that could not otherwise affect a person of normal health.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Kentucky and West Virginia Co., Inc. vs. Ander­son, 156 SW.
857, the average of three readings along the plaintiff's fence was only 44
decibels but, because the sound from the sub-station was interminable and mono­tonous,
the court authorized an injunction and damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, the three readings along the property line are 52, 54
and 55 decibels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's case is
manifestly stronger.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> company argues that the
plaintiff should not be heard to complain because the sound level at the North
General Hospital, where silence is observed, is even higher than at his
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This comparison lacks basis
because it has not been established that the hos­pital is located in
surroundings similar to the resi­dential zone where the plaintiff lived or that
the sound at the hospital is similarly monotonous and ceaseless as the sound emitted
by the sub-station.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Soria</span>
testified that "The way the trans­formers are built, the humming sound
cannot be avoided".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
testimony, the company emphasizes that the sub-station was constructed for
public convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admitting that the
sound cannot be eliminated, there is no proof that it can not be reduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the sub-station is needed for the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> to be able to serve well its customers is no
reason, however, why it should be operated to the detriment and discomfort of
others.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> had received
no complaint although it had been operating hereabouts for the past 50 years
with substations similar to the one in contro­versy is not a valid
argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of suit neither
lessens the company's liability under the law nor weakens the right of others
against it to demand their just due.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the damages caused by the noise, appellant Velasco, himself
a physician, claimed that the noise, as a precipitating factor, has caused him
anxiety neurosis, which, in turn, predisposed him to, or is <span class="SpellE">concommitant</span>
with, the other ailments which he was suffering at the time of the trial,
namely, <span class="SpellE">pyelonephritis</span>, <span class="SpellE">ureteritis</span>
and others; that these resulted in the loss of his professional income and
reduced his life expectancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
breakdown of his claims is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">A host of expert witnesses and voluminous medical literature,
laboratory findings and statistics of income were introduced in support of the
above claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical evidence of plaintiff's doctors prepon­derates over
the expert evidence for defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, not
merely because of its positive character but also because the physicians
presented by plaintiff had actually treated him, while the defense experts had
not done so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the evidence of the
latter was to a large extent conjectural.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That appellant's physical ailments should be due to infectious organisms
does not alter the fact that the loss of sleep, irritation and tension due to
excessive noise weakened his constitution and made him easy prey to the
infection.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the amount of damages claimed by appellant, it is plain
that the same are exaggerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin
with, the alleged loss of earnings at the rate of P19,000 per annum is
predicated on the Internal Revenue assessment, Exhibit "QQ-1",
wherein appellant was found to have undeclared income of P8,338.20 in addition
to his declared gross income of P10,975.00 for 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no competent showing, however, that
the source of such undeclared income was appel­lant's profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the inference would be to the
contrary, for his gross income from the previous years 1951 to 1953 [Exhibits
"QQ-1(d)" to "QQ-1(f)"] was only P8,085.00 P5,860.00 and P7,120.00,
respectively, an average of P7,000.00 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, while his 1947 and 1948 income was
larger (P9,995.00 and P11,900.00), it appears that P5,000 thereof was the
appellant's annual salary from the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Memorial
Foundation, which was not really con­nected with the usual earnings derived
from practice as a physician.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, therefore, his actual earnings, the claimed moral damages
of P100,000.00 are utterly dis­proportionate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The alleged losses for shortening of appel­lant's life expectancy are
not only inflated but specula­tive.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the demand for exemplary or punitive damages, there appears
no adequate basis for their award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Manila Electric Company was convicted
for erecting the substation in question without permit from the Public Service
Commission, We find reasonable its explanation that its officials and counsel
had originally deemed that such permit was not required as the installation was
authorized by the terms of its franchise (as amended by Republic Act No. 150)
requiring it to spend within 5 years not less than forty million pesos for
maintenance and additions to its electric system, including needed power plants
and substations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither the absence of
such permit from the Public Service Commission nor the lack of permit from the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City autho­rities (a permit that was subsequently
granted) is incom­patible with the Company's good faith, until the courts
finally ruled that its interpretation of the franchise was incorrect.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are, moreover, several factors that mitigate defendant's liability
in damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is that the noise
from the substation does not appear to be an exclusive causative factor of
plaintiff-appellant's illnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
proved by the circumstance that no other person in Velasco's own household nor
in his immediate neighborhood was shown to have become sick despite the noise
complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also evidence
that at the time the plaintiff-appellant appears to have been largely indebted
to various credit institutions, as a result of his unsuccessful gubernatorial
campaign, and this court can take judicial cognizance of the fact that
financial worries can affect unfavorably the debtor's disposition and
mentality.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other factor militating against full recovery by the
petitioner Velasco is his passivity in the face of the damage caused to him by
the noise of the substation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realizing
as a physician that the latter was disturbing or depriving him of sleep and
affecting both his physical and mental well being, he did not take any steps to
bring action to abate the nuisance or remove himself from the affected area as
soon as the deleterious effects became noticeable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To evade them appellant did not even have to
sell his house; he could have leased it and rented other premises for sleeping
and maintaining his office and thus preserve his health as ordinary prudence
demanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead he obstinately stayed
until his health became gravely affected, apparently hoping that he would
thereby saddle <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> with large damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law in this jurisdiction is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2203 prescribes that "The party
suffering loss or injury must exercise the diligence of a good father of a
family to minimize the damages resulting from the act or omission in
question".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
rule, which embodies the previous jurisprudence on the point<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>,
clearly obligates the injured party to undertake measures that will alleviate
and not ag­gravate his condition after the infliction of the injury, and places
upon him the burden of explaining why he could not do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not done.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Velasco introduced evidence to the effect that he tried
to sell his house to Jose Valencia, Jr., in September, 1953, and on a 60 day
option, for P95,000.00, but that the prospective buyer backed out on account of
his wife objecting to the noise of the substation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reliable evidence, however, how
much were appellant's lot and house worth, either before the option was given
to Va­lencia or after he refused to proceed with the sale or even during the
intervening period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of a
previous offer for P125,000.00, as claimed by the plaintiff, was not
corroborated by Valencia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What Valencia
testified to in his deposition is that when they were negotiating on the price
Velasco mentioned to him about an offer by someone for P125,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Valencia proves that in the
dialog between him and Velasco, part of the subject of their conversation was
about the prior offer, but it does not cor­roborate or prove the reality of the
offer for P125,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of
Velasco on this point, standing alone, is not credible enough, what with his
penchant for metaphor and exaggeration, as previously adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is urged in appellant's brief, along the
lines of his own testimony, that since one (1) transformer was measured by
witness Jimenez with a noise intensity of 47.2 decibels at a distance of 30.48
meters, the two (2) transformers of the substation should create an intensity
of 94.4 decibels at the same distance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If this were true, then the residence of the plaintiff is more noisy
than the noisiest spot at the Niagara Falls, which registers only 92 decibels
(Exhi­bit "15-A").</p>

<p class="BODY">Since there is no evidence upon which to compute any loss or
damage allegedly incurred by the plaintiff by the frustration of the sale on
account of the noise, his claim therefore was correctly disallowed by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be added that there is no
showing of any further attempts on the part of appellant to dispose of the
house, and this fact suffices to raise doubts as to whether he truly intended to
dispose of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no actual need to
do so in order to escape deterioration of his health, as heretofore noted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the wide gap between what was claimed and what was
proved, the plaintiff is entitled to damages for the annoyance and adverse effects
suffered by him since the substation started functioning in January, 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering all the circumstances disclosed
by the record, as well as appellant's failure to minimize the deleterious
influences from the substation, this Court is of the opinion that an award in
the amount of P20,000.00, by way of moderate and moral damages up to the
present, is reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recovery of
attorney's fees and litigation expenses in the sum of P5,000.00 is also
justified --- the factual and legal issues were intri­cate (the transcript of
the stenographic notes is about 5,000 pages, side from an impressive number of
exhibits), and raised for the first time in this jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The last issue is whether the City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Agan</span>, a co-defendant, may be held <span class="SpellE">soli­darily</span>
liable with <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Agan</span> was included as a party defendant
because he al­legedly (1) did not require the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>
to secure a building permit for the construction of the substation; (2) even
defended its construction by not insisting on such building permit; and (3) did
not initiate its removal or demolition and the criminal prosecution of the
officials of the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not support these allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first plea, it was not <span class="SpellE">Agan's</span> duty to require the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>
to secure a permit before the construction but for <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>
to apply for it, as per Section 1, Ordinance No. 1530, of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second allegation is not true, because <span class="SpellE">Agan</span> wrote the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> requiring
it to submit the plan and to pay permit fees (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,
14 January 1960, pages 2081-2082).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the third allegation, no law or ordinance has been cited specifying that it is
the city engineer's duty to initiate the removal or demolition of, or for the
criminal prosecution of, those persons who are responsible for the
nuisance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act 537, Section 24
(d), relied upon by the plaintiff, requires an order by, or previous approval
of, the mayor for the city engineer to cause or order the removal of buildings
or structures in violation of law or ordinances, but the mayor could not be
expected to take action because he was of the belief, as he testified, that the
sound "did not have any effect on his body".</p>
