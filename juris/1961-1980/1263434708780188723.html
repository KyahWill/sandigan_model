<p class="BODY">On March 3, 1964, plaintiff filed this suit in the Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch VI, wherein it prayed that 1) Ordinance No. 4 be declared
inapplicable to it, or in the alternative, that it be pronounced <u>ultra</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span> and void for being beyond the power of the
Municipality to enact; and 2) that defendant Municipality be ordered to refund
to it the amount of P42<span class="GramE">,265.13</span> which it had paid under
protest; and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, defendant Municipality upheld its power to enact
the Ordinance in question; questioned the jurisdiction of the trial Court to
take cognizance of the action under section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act in that
it seeks to enjoin the enforcement of a Municipal Ordinance; and pleaded
prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span> for plaintiff's failure to
timely question the validity of the said Ordinance.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had agreed to submit the case for judgment on
the pleadings, the trial Court upheld its jurisdiction as well as defendant
Municipality's power to enact the Ordinance in question under section 2238 of
the Revised Administrative Code, otherwise known as the general welfare clause,
and declared that plaintiff's right of action had prescribed under the 5-year
period provided for by Article 1149 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, plaintiff interposes the following Assignments of
Error:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT ORDINANCE NO. 4, SERIES
OF 1957, ENACTED BY THE DEFENDANT MUNICIPALITY OF JAGNA, BOHOL, IS A VALID,
LEGAL AND ENFORCEABLE ORDINANCE AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE ACTION OF THE
PLAINTIFF TO ANNUL AND TO DECLARE ORDINANCE NO. 4, SERIES OF 1957 OF THE
DEFENDANT HAS ALREADY PRESCRIBED.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>"AND, FINALLY, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING ORDINANCE
NO. 4, SERIES OF 1957 ULTRA VIRES AND VOID AND IN NOT ORDERING THE REFUND OF
TAXES PAID THEREUNDER."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is plaintiff's submission that the subject Ordinance is
inapplicable to it as it is not engaged in the business or trade of storing
copra for others for compensation or profit and that the only copra it stores
is for its exclusive use in connection with its business as manufacturer of
soap, edible oil, margarine and other similar products; that the levy is
intended as an "export tax" as it is collected on "exportable
copra", and, therefore, beyond the power of the Municipality to enact; and
that the fee of P0.10 for every 100 kilos of copra stored in the bodega is
excessive, unreasonable and oppressive and is imposed more for revenue than as
a regulatory fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main question to determine is whether defendant Municipality
was authorized to impose and collect the storage fee provided for in the
challenged Ordinance under the laws then prevailing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the Ordinance must be upheld pursuant to the
broad authority conferred upon municipalities by Commonwealth Act No. 472,
approved on June 16, 1939, which was the prevailing law when the Ordinance was
enacted (Procter &amp; Gamble Trading Co. vs. Municipality of Medina, 43 SCRA
130 [1972]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 thereof reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A municipal council or municipal district
council shall have the authority to impose municipal license taxes upon persons
engaged in any occupation or business, or exercising privileges in the
municipality or municipal district, by requiring them to secure licenses at
rates fixed by the municipal council, or municipal district council, and to
collect fees and charges for services rendered by the municipality or municipal
district and shall otherwise have power to levy for public local purposes, and
for school purposes, including teachers' salaries, just and uniform taxes other
than percentage taxes and taxes on specified articles.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the foregoing provision, a municipality is authorized to
impose three kinds of licenses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) a
license for regulation of useful occupation or enterprises; (2) license for
restriction or regulation of non-useful occupations or enterprises; and (3)
license for revenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is thus unnecessary, as plaintiff would have us do, to determine whether the
subject storage fee is a tax for revenue purposes or a license fee to reimburse
defendant Municipality for service of supervision because defendant
Municipality is authorized not only to impose a license fee but also to tax for
revenue purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The storage fee imposed under the questioned Ordinance is
actually a municipal license tax or fee on persons, firms and corporations,
like plaintiff, exercising the privilege of storing copra in a bodega within
the Municipality's territorial jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the term "license tax" has not acquired a fixed
meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is often used
indiscriminately to designate impositions exacted for the exercise of various
privileges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In many instances, it refers
to "revenue-raising exactions on privileges or activities."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Not only is the imposition of the storage fee authorized by the
general grant of authority under section 1 of CA No. 472.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is the storage fee in question
prohibited nor beyond the power of the municipal councils and municipal
district councils to impose, as listed in section 3 of said CA. No. 472.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the business of buying and selling and storing copra is
properly the subject of regulation within the police power granted to
municipalities under section 2238 of the Revised Administrative Code or the
"general welfare clause”, which we quote hereunder:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 2238.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>General power of council
to enact ordinances and make regulations</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>– The municipal council shall enact such
ordinances and make such regulations, not repugnant to law, as may be necessary
to carry into effect and discharge the powers and duties conferred upon it by
law and such as shall seem necessary and proper to provide for the health and
safety, promote the prosperity, improve the morals, peace, good order, comfort,
and convenience of the municipality and the inhabitants thereof, and for the
protection of property therein."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">For it has been held that a warehouse
used for keeping or storing copra is an establishment likely to endanger the
public safety or likely to give rise to conflagration because the oil content
of the copra when ignited is difficult to put under control by water and the
use of chemicals is necessary to put out the fire.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
And as the Ordinance itself states, all exportable copra deposited within the
municipality is "part of the surveillance and lookout of municipal
authorities."</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's argument that the imposition of P0.10 per 100 kilos
of copra stored in a bodega within defendant's territory is beyond the cost of
regulation and surveillance is not well taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As enunciated in the case of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling
Co. vs. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>, <u>supra.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"The cost of regulation cannot be taken as a gauge, if the
municipality really intended to enact a revenue ordinance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, 'if the charge exceeds the expense of
issuance of a license and costs of regulation, it is a tax'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if it is, and it is validly imposed, 'the
rule that license fees for regulation must bear a reasonable relation to the
expense of the regulation has no application'.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Municipal corporations are allowed wide discretion in determining
the rates of imposable license fees even in cases of purely police power
measures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of proof as to
municipal conditions and the nature of the business being taxed as well as
other factors relevant to the issue of arbitrariness or unreasonableness of the
questioned rates, Courts will go slow in writing off an Ordinance.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, appellant has not sufficiently shown that the rate imposed
by the questioned Ordinance is oppressive, excessive and prohibitive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's averment that the Ordinance, even if presumed valid,
is inapplicable to it because it is not engaged in the business or occupation
of buying or selling of copra but is only storing copra in connection with its
main business of manufacturing soap and other similar products, and that to be
compelled to pay the storage fees would amount to double taxation, does not
inspire assent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of whether
appellant is engaged in that business or not is irrelevant because the storage
fee, as previously mentioned, is an imposition on the privilege of storing
copra in a bodega within defendant municipality by persons, firms or
corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the Ordinance
in question does not state that said persons, firms or corporations should be
engaged in the business or occupation of buying or selling copra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, by plaintiff's own admission that
it is a consolidated corporation with its trading company, it will be hard to
segregate the copra it uses for trading from that it utilizes for
manufacturing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it can be said that plaintiff's payment of storage fees
imposed by the Ordinance in question does not amount to double taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For double taxation to exist, the same
property must be taxed twice, when it should be taxed but once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Double taxation has also been defined as
taxing the same person twice by the same jurisdiction for the same thing.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Surely, a tax on plaintiff's products is different from a tax on the privilege
of storing copra in a bodega situated within the territorial boundary of
defendant municipality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Plaintiff's</span> further contention that the
storage fee imposed by the Ordinance is actually intended to be an export tax,
which is expressly prohibited by section 2287 of the Revised Administrative
Code, is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said provision
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 2287.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It shall not be in the power of the municipal council to
impose a tax in any form whatever upon goods and merchandise carried into the
municipality, or out of the same, and any attempt to impose an import or export
tax upon such goods in the guise of an unreasonable charge for <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>, use of bridges or otherwise, shall be void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> ."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We have held that only where there is a
clear showing that what is being taxed is an export to any foreign country
would the prohibition come into play.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
When the Ordinance itself speaks of "exportable" copra, the meaning
conveyed is not exclusively export to a foreign country but shipment out of the
municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The storage fee impugned
is not a tax on export because it is imposed not only upon copra to be exported
but also upon copra sold and to be used for domestic purposes if stored in any
warehouse in the Municipality and the weight thereof is 100 kilos or more.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus finding the Ordinance in question to be valid, legal and
enforceable, we find it unnecessary to discuss the ascribed error that the
Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred in declaring that appellant had not paid the
taxes under protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, we find merit in plaintiff's contention that the lower
Court erred in ruling that its action has prescribed under Article 1149 of the
Civil Code, which provides for a period of five years for all actions whose
periods are not fixed in that Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case of Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Opon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
Phil<span class="GramE">.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
is authority for the view that the period for prescription of actions to
recover municipal license taxes is six years under Article 1145(2) of the Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, plaintiff's action brought
within six years from the time the right of action first accrued in 1958 has
not yet prescribed.</p>
