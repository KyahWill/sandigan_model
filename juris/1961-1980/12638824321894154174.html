				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court sets aside respondent director's appealed resolution
and rules in accordance with the prevailing law and settled jurisprudence that
the petitioner union consisting of the members-employees of respondent
corporation is the principal party to the collective bargaining agreement
(rather than the respondent mother union which is merely its agent) and is
therefore entitled to be <span style="">recognized as </span>the
sole and exclusive bargaining representa­tive entitled to administer and
enforce the collective bargaining agreement with the employer corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The undisputed antecedent
facts which gave rise to the present petition are stated in the petition as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"2. That
sometime on February 1974, petitioner­-<span class="SpellE">Elisco</span> <span class="SpellE">Elirol</span> Labor Union (NAFLU), negotiated and executed a
collective bargaining agreement with res­pondent-<span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span>

<blockquote>"3. That upon
verification by individual petitioners at the Registration Division, Bureau of
Labor Relations, Department of Labor, the <span class="SpellE">Elisco-Elirol</span>
Labor Union (NAFLU), the contracting party in said collective bargaining
agreement, was not then registered and therefore not entitled to the benefits
and privileges embodied in said collective bargaining agreement; thus on March
3, 1975, the members of petitioner-appellant union in a general membership
meeting decided in a resolution to register their union to protect and preserve
the integrity and inviolability of the collective bargaining agreement between
the <span class="SpellE">Elisco-Elirol</span> Labor Union (NAFLU) and the <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> Steel Consolidated, Inc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. That said
resolution of the members of petitioner-appellant union was passed upon by the
officers and members of the Board of Directors on <st1:date month="5" day="20" year="1975">May 20, 1975</st1:date>, at a special meeting called for the
purpose, resolution No. 6, <span class="GramE">s</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1975 was approved requesting the Acting
Directors, Registration Division, <span class="GramE">Bureau</span> of Labor
Relations, to register the union <span class="SpellE">Elisco-Elirol</span> Labor
Union (NAFLU).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5. That by
virtue of resolution No. 6, Peti­tioner-appellant union applied for
registration with the Bureau of Labor Relations, hence on <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1975">May 28, 1975</st1:date>, Certificate of Registration No.
8511-IP was issued by <span style="">said Office.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"6. That with
the issuance of the certificate of registration petitioner-appellant acquired a
person­ality separate and distinct from any other labor union.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7. That steps
were taken by petitioner-appel­lant to enforce the collective bargaining
agreement as the principal party to the same representing the workers covered
by such agreement <span class="GramE">immediately <span style="">&nbsp;</span>after</span> the issuance of the certificate
of registration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8. That on
June 10, 1975, at a special meeting called for the purpose, the general
membership of petitioner union decided that their mother union, the National
Federation <span style="">of </span>Labor Unions, can
no longer safeguard the rights of its members insofar as work­ing conditions
and other terms of employment are concerned and that the interest and welfare
of petitioner can be served best if it will stay independent and dis­affiliated
from said mother union, hence, the general membership adopted a resolution to
disaffiliate from the National Federation of Labor Unions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9. That on <st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1975">June 11, 1975</st1:date>, petitioner, acting
through its President <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Riza</span>
informed respondents of said disaffiliation by means of a letter, and subse­quently
requested respondents to recognize petitioner <span style="">as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of the employees
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">10. </span>That respondent without any
justifiable reason refused and continues to refuse to recognize petitioner as
the sole and exclusive bargaining repre­sentative of its employees and, now
actually dismissed the petitioner union's officers and board members.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In this connection, a complaint for unfair labor prac­tice was filed by
petitioners against respondents for the latter's refusal to bargain
collectively with peti­tioner, which complaint is presently <span class="SpellE">dockected</span>
as Case No. <span class="GramE">LR-RO4-6-1662.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"11. That by
virtue of said refusal of respondent company to recognize petitioner as the
sole and exclu­sive bargaining representative of the employees, peti­tioners
filed a petition before the Bureau of Labor Relations, Department of Labor on
July 2, 1975, with Case No. LR-861 against respondents <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span>
Steel Consolidated, Inc. and the National Federation of Labor Unions be ordered
to stop from presenting itself as the collective bargaining agent and pursuant
thereto, a writ of preliminary mandatory and prohibitory injunc­tion be issued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"12. That on <st1:date month="8" day="19" year="1975">August 19, 1975</st1:date>, the Bureau of Labor
Relations, through Med-Arbiter Reynaldo B. <span class="SpellE">Carta</span>,
before whom the case was heard, issued an Order dismissing the petition for
lack of merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to respondent Director of the Bureau of Labor
Relations, said respondent issued his Resolution of <st1:date month="10" day="30" year="1975">October 30, 1975</st1:date> affirming the dismissal of
petitioner-union's petition as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On February, 1974 the members of the petitioner <span style="">union who </span>were then yet affiliated
with the National Association of Free Labor Union nego­tiated and executed with
the respondent company a collective bargaining agreement with expiry date in
November, 1976.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1975">May 28, 1975</st1:date>,
after the same members, by <u>valid</u> resolution of the Board of directors
and approved by the general membership, have formed themselves into an <u>independent
organization</u> and applied for <span style="">registration
as a union, a certificate of registration was issued by the Department of
Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on </span><st1:date month="6" day="10" year="1975"><span style="">June </span><span style="">10, 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> again by a <u>valid</u> resolution the same
members disaffiliated with the NAFLU.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The issue for resolution is -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">Which of the two unions should be
recognized as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of the employees
and ultimately recognized to admin­ister and supervise the enforcement of the
collective bargaining agreement.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner-union contends that <u>it having the </u><u><span style="">necessary </span>interest and being the real
party</u> must be the sole union to be recognized and given authority to
bargain with the company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Setting aside jurisprudence and the collective bargaining
agreement of the parties, <u>the appellant is correct</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">For
</span>to grant to the former mother union (NAFLU) the authority</u> to
administer and enforce their collective bargaining agreement <u>without
presumably any members in the bargaining unit is quite absurd</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to transfer also the authority to the newly
formed union although the members of the same were the same members who
composed then the local chapter of the mother union is also in violation of the
CBA particularly article IV which is the <u>union secur</u><u><span style="">ity clause</span></u><span style="">, </span>wherein i<span style="">t </span>is a condition for a continued
employment in the company to maintain membership in the Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Theoretically</u> therefore, when the
employees disaffiliated from the mother union and formed themselves into a new
union, their status as employees <span style="">was </span>also
terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such <span style="">they could not </span>therefore absolutely
and legally claim that <span style="">they </span>still
comprise the <span style="">majority </span>of the
bargaining unit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Secondly, to vest, upon the new union the authority to
bargain is in violation of the whole CBA, under the theory that when the mother
union (NAFLU) entered and executed the same in its separate and distinct
personality aside from the people composing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fine, the CBA then was executed by and
between the company and the (NAFLU) with the latter as an entity having its own
capacity and person­ality different from the members composing the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lastly, to preserve and avoid <span class="SpellE">unstability</span>
and disorder in the labor movement as correctly ruled by the med-arbiter, the
status quo should be preserved, there being no compelling reason to alter the
same."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the petition at bar.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the petition to be clearly
meritorious and reverse the appealed resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent director
correctly perceived in his Resolution that "to grant to the former mother
union (NAFLU) the authority to administer and enforce their collective
bargaining agreement without presumably any members in the bargaining unit is
quite absurd" but fell unto the grave error of holding that "when the
employees disaffiliated from the mother union and formed them­selves into a new
union, their status as employees was also terminated."</p>

<p class="BODY">His error was in not perceiving that the employees and members of
the local union did not form a new union but merely registered the local union
as was their right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Elisco­-Elirol</span> Labor Union-NAFLU, consisting of employees
and members of the local union was the <u>principal party</u> to the
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NAFLU as the "mother
union" in participating in the execution of the bar­gaining agreement with
respondent company acted merely as <u>agent</u> of the local union, which
remained the basic unit of the associa­tion existing principally and freely to
serve the common interest of all its members, including the freedom to
disaffiliate when the circumstanc<span style="">e</span>s
so warranted <span style="">as </span>in the present
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to respondent
director's misimpression, our jurisprudence fully supports petitioner's
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place><u>Liberty</u></st1:place></st1:city><u>
Cotton Mills Workers </u><st1:place><u>Union</u></st1:place><u> vs. Liberty

the Court expressly cited and affirmed the basic principle that "(T)he
locals are separate and distinct units primarily designed <span style="">to secure and maintain an equality of
bargaining power between the employer and their employee-members in the
economic struggle for the fruits of the joint productive effort of labor and
capital; and <u>the association of the locals into the national union (as
PAFLU) was in furtherance of the same end</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These associations are consensual entities capable of entering into such
legal relations with their members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
essential purpose was the affiliation of the local unions into a common
enterprise to in­crease by collective action the common bargaining power in
respect of the terms and conditions of labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Yet the locals remained the basic units of association, free to serve
their own and the common interest of all, subject to the restraints imposed by
the Constitution and By-Laws of the Association, and free also to renounce the
affiliation for mutual welfare upon the terms laid down in the agreement which
brought it into existence</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>, the "<span class="SpellE"><u>substitutionary</u></span><u>" doctrine</u> likewise fully
supports petitioner's stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
union to whom the employees owe their allegiance has from the beginning
expressly avowed that it "does not intend to change and/or amend the provi­sions
of the present collective bargaining agreement but only to be given the chance
to enforce the same since there is a shift of allegiance in the majority of the
employees at respondent company." As was stressed by the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Benguet</u></span><u> Consolidated Inc. vs. BCI Employees,
&amp; Workers Union-PAFLU</u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></u></span></a>
-</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> This principle, formulated by
the NLRB as its initial compromise solution to the problem facing it when there
occurs a shift in employees' union allegiance of after the execution of a
bargaining contract with their employer, merely states that even during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of a collective bargaining agreement executed
between employer and employees thru their agent, the employees can change said
agent <u>but the contract continues to bind them up to its expiration date</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may bargain however for the shortening
of said expiration date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In formulating the '<span class="SpellE"><u>substitutionary</u></span>'
doctrine, the only consideration involved was the <u>employees</u>' <u>interest</u>
in the <span style="">existing </span>bargaining
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>agent's</u> interest
never entered the picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
justification for said doctrine was:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>that <span class="GramE">the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>majority</span> of the employees</u>, as an
entity under the statute, <u>is the true party in interest to the contract</u>,
holding rights through the agency of the union representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, any exclusive interest claimed by the
agent is <span class="SpellE">defeasible</span> at the will of the
principal.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It need only be
mentioned finally that the Secretary of Labor in his decision of April 23, 1976
and order of January 10, 1977 denying reconsideration in the sister unfair
labor practice case and ordering respondent corporation to immediately lift the
suspension and reinstate the complainant officers and board members of
petitioner union<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
has likewise adhered to the foregoing basic principles and settled
jurisprudence in contrast to respondent director (as well as therein respondent
NLRC which similarly adhered to the archaic and illogical view that the
officers and board members of petitioner local union committed <span style="">an "act of disloyalty" in
disaffiliating from the mother union when practically all its members had so
voted to disaffiliate and the mother union [as mere agent] no longer had any
local union or members to represent), ruling that "(G)ranting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the disaffiliation </span>from <span style="">the NAFLU is a legal cause for expulsion and
dismissal, it could not detract from the fact that only 13 individual
complainants out of almost 700 members who disaffiliated, were singled out for
expulsion and recommended for dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The actuations of NAFLU conclusively constitute discrimination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the suspension of the complainants was <span class="GramE">effected</span> at the instance of NAFLU, it should be held liable
to the payment of back wages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Presidential Assistant for Legal Affairs <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>
B. Zamora has likewise dismissed as untenable in a similar case respondents'
views that "such maintenance of membership" clause be distorted as
"intended for the security of the union rather than the security of tenure
for the workers", ruling that "(W<span class="GramE">)hat</span> is
paramount, as it is expressly and explicitly emphasized in an exact­ing
language under the New Constitution, is the security of tenure of the workers,
not the security of the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
impress, there­fore, such 'maintenance of membership' -- which is intended for
the security of the union rather than the security of tenure of the workers --
as a bar to employees' changing their affiliation is not only to infringe on
the constitutional right of freedom of associa­tion, but also to trample upon
the constitutional right of workers to security of tenure and to render
meaningless whatever 'adequate social services' the State may establish or
maintain in the field of employment ' to guarantee the enjoyment by the people
of a decent standard of living.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is expected that with this decision, any suspension or lay-off
of the complainants officers and board members or employees of petitioner union
arising from the respondents' misconception of the clearly applicable
principles and juris­prudence upholding the primacy of the employees and their
freely chosen local union as the true party in interest to the collective
bargaining agreement will be forthwith rectified and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is granted and the appealed
resolution is set aside and petitioner local union is declared to be the sole
and exclusive bargaining representative of the employees of <span class="GramE">respondent
