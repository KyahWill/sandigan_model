				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pablo, Angel, Amador and Andres, surnamed <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
arrived on <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1961</st1:date>
from abroad at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>,
on board a Cathay Pacific Airways plane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They sought admission to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
alleging that they were Filipino citizens and the children of one Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board
of Special Inquiry, on <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="12">December 18,
 1961</st1:date>, admitted them as Filipino citizens.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1962</st1:date>,
the Board of Commissioners, on re­view of the decision of the Board of Special
Inquiry, held that the aforesaid persons had not satisfactorily established
their claim to Filipino citizenship and, therefore, resolved to exclude them
from the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A warrant of arrest
and exclusion was thereupon issued against them by the Commissioner of
Immigration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pablo <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and his three companions
filed, on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1965</st1:date>, a
petition in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> branch, for prohibition with
preliminary injunction, to restrain the Commissioner of Immigration from
arresting and deporting them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="10">Octo­ber 23, 1965</st1:date>,
after hearing, issued a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent filed his answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The parties then sub­mitted the case for decision upon a stipulation of
facts and documentary evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1966</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance found that petitioners had sufficiently established
their Fili­pino citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
therefore granted the prohibition writ applied for and made the preliminary
injunction per­manent. Appeal was taken to Us from said decision, by the
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present action is in reality a review of the de­cision of the
Board of Commissioners, promulgated on March 8, 1962, even if designated as
prohibition (Roman Santos v. Secretary Moreno, G.R. No. L-15829, <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1967</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the court's function is only to ascertain
whether the find­ings of the board are in accord with law, free from fraud or
imposition, and whether they find any reasonable sup­port in the evidence. (<u>Ibid</u>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the proceedings before the Board of Commissioners, petitioner
sought to prove that they are Filipino citi­zens by showing, first, that Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> is a Filipino citizen; and second, that they are
the children of Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>. In support of the
first proposition, they pre­sented (1) a baptismal certificate stating that
Roman <span class="SpellE">Gon­zaga</span> was baptized on August 19, 1908, at
the age of 21 days thus indicating that he was born on <u>July 30, 1908</u>,
and further stating that he is the son of Juliana <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
a Filipino, of an <u>unknown father</u>; (2) a birth certificate showing that
Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> was torn on <u>August 9, 1908</u> to
Juliana <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, and an <u>unknown father</u>; and
(3) a landing certificate of residence, issued to Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
which shows that he was born on <u>July 15, 1908</u> and was permitted to land
as a native born Filipino citizen, the son of Juliana <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stating that the dates of birth indicated therein being
different, doubt arises as to whether they refer to <u>one</u> person or <u>three</u>
different persons, the Board of Commissioners found that the point was not
adequately es­tablished.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second proposition, it said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Applicants claim to be the children of
Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> out of this aforesaid marriage in 1931
with Tan. Ho.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again <u>this, claim
suffers from lack of competent evidence to establish the paternity and <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> of the claimant children</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other than the self-serving testimonies of
applicants and their alleged father, nothing was submitted to prove that
applicants are the children of Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, a
Philippine citizen."</p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, the Court of First Instance ruled, on the first
point, that the discrepancies as to the date of birth of Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> are immaterial, what controlled is that in said
documents he is stated to be the son of Ju­liana <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
a Filipino, and an unknown father, which proves him to be a Filipino
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to the second point, the
Court said: Filipino is undisputed that the petitioners are really children of
a Filipino citizen x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the court had in mind the
stipulation of facts which stated, in par. 1, that: "On December 12, 1961,
pe­titioners herein arrived at the port of Manila on board Cathay Pacific
Airways plane and sought admission into the Philippines as Filipino citizens, <u>being
the children of Roman <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span></u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In so doing, the court exceeded its powers as a re­viewer of the
findings of an administrative body; for it resolved a factual issue on the
basis of something not presented before said administrative body and reversed
the latter's findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
petitioners, alleged Fi­lipino citizenship could not properly be stipulated
upon, after petitioners were ordered to be excluded from the country by the
Board of Commissioners on the ground of fai­lure to establish their alleged
Philippine citizenship, the allegation of which was the reason why they were
admitted here in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since,
unquestionably, petitioners failed to prove and establish, by sufficient and
competent evidence, Philippine citizenship, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred
in granting the petition in question and res­training the Commissioner of
Immigration from arresting and deporting them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed
and set aside, the petition for prohibition is dis­missed, and the preliminary
injunction issued by the lower court which was made permanent, is hereby
dissolved, with costs against <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>
