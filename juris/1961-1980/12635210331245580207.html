<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that prior to

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, after a certification election had been held in
Case No. 761-MC wherein the petitioner Union, the <span class="SpellE">Benguet-Balatoc</span>
Workers Union and five other labor unions participated, the Court of Industrial
Relations issued an order dated August 18, 1962 certifying "the herein
peti­tioner Union<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> as the sole and exclusive
bargaining agent of the non-supervisory employees and workers in the em­ploy of
the respondent company in its <span class="SpellE">Acupan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Antamok</span> and <span class="SpellE">Batatoc</span> mines."</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 15, 1962 the <span class="SpellE">Bobok</span> Lumber
Jack Asso­ciation, one of the unions which participated in the cer­tification
election (Case No. 761-MC), filed with the re­spondent court a complaint for
"Declaratory Relief with Preliminary Injunction", docketed as Civil
Case No. 1150, praying that judgment be rendered declaring that <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated, Inc. and herein petitioner Union,
named defendants there, "cannot enter into an agreement con­tinuing the
modified union shop in the aforementioned collective bargaining
(contract)", and that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued to
restrain the company from making deductions of union dues from the wages of its
employees and workers in <span class="SpellE">Acupan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Antamok</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balatoc</span> and turning over such deductions to the
defendant union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date,
respondent court issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for in the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">a supplemental order dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="9"><span style="">September 18, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> "newly hired employees or laborers or
those who will be hired later on by the defendant company" were exempted
from the operation of the aforesaid writ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 24 and 25, 1962 respondent company and <span style="">herein petitioner </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, respectively, filed motions to </span>lift
the preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
hearing thereof the parties, through their respective counsel, mutually agreed
that the company resume deducting <span style="">union
dues from </span>all employees, the same to be held in trust for dispo­<span style="">sition as the court might </span>later on <span style="">direct in its reso­lution on the motions to
lift, </span>concerning which the parties would submit their arguments in
writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to said agreement
respondent court issued an order dated <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="9">September
 28, 1962</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the agreement of the parties made in open
court in order, the Court approves the same and hereby orders that, effective
be­ginning the work week of September 23, 1962, the Company resume making
deductions of union compensation from all employees heretofore pay­ing to the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatoc</span> Workers Union as
well as from newly hired employees, but to hold the same in trust to be
disposed of in the man­ner that this Court may direct in its resolution on the
motions to lift the preliminary injunction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1962</st1:date>
herein petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place> moved to dismiss the complaint
filed in Civil Case No. 1150 on three (3) grounds, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the cause of action <span style="">was barred by prior judgment; (2) that the
complaint stated no cause of action; and (3) that the plaintiff had no legal
capacity to sue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pending resolution of the motions to lift the preli­minary
injunction and the motion to dismiss the complaint, herein petitioner filed the
instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prayers in the petition are for this Court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) to declare that respondent court had no
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the action for declaratory relief filed by
the <span class="SpellE">Bobok</span> Lumber Jack Association (Civil Case No.
1150) and to issue a writ of preliminary injunction therein; and (b) to issue a
writ of mandatory injunction requiring re­spondent company to deliver to
petitioner the union dues which it has deducted from the wages of its employees
and which are held in trust pursuant to the order of respond­ent court dated
September 28, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">With leave of this Court the <span class="SpellE">Bobok</span>
Lumber Jack Asso­ciation, plaintiff below, came in as <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
and filed its answer in intervention, denying most of the allega­tions in the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the instant petition was prematurely filed and
hence must be dismissed for that reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The is­sue of respondent court's jurisdiction in the declaratory relief
case was raised in the motion to dismiss filed by herein petitioner with said
court; and the issue concern­ing the validity of the writ of preliminary
injunction with respect to the deduction of union dues was likewise raised in
the two motions to lift the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
three motions had not yet been resolved by respondent court when the instant
petition was filed, contrary to the settled rule that <i>certiorari</i> against
an inferior court is not pro­per when the remedies sought are still available
in said court, so much so that even after it has acted a motion for
reconsideration must, as a general rule, be filed in order to afford it an
opportunity to rectify its error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the questions raised in the petition involve many
facts alleged therein and denied in the an­swers of the respondents - facts
which require presentation of evidence not supplied by the pleadings or by
their annexes now before us.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed, with costs against
petitioner.</p>
