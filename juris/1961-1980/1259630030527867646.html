				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal taken by the Earnshaws "Docks a Honolulu Iron Works, hereinafter 
referred to simply as Earnshaws Docks, from the decision of the Auditor General 
denying its claim for refund of the amount of P198,695.61, representing the 17 
per cent special excise tax levied by the levied Central Bank of the 
Philippines, hereinafter referred to simply as Central Bank, on its dollar 
earnings abroad utilized to purchase shares of the Hawaiian-Philippine common 
stock and of the San Carlos Milling Co., Ltd., and for other purposes.
<p>The Earnshaws Docks is a business name and style of the Honolulu Iron Works, 
a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Hawaii, U.S.A., and 
duly licensed to engage in business in the Philippines. During the effectivity 
of Republic Act No. 601 (the 17 per cent foreign exchange tax law, which took 
effect on March 28, 1951 and was repealed by Republic Act No. 1394 on December 
31, 1955), the Earnshaws Docks received in its New York office dollar 
commissions from foreign manufacturers totalling $580,048.475.</p>
<p>On May 26, 1954, Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co., Far East, Ltd., for itself and on 
behalf of Edward J. Nell Co. and Earnshaws Docks, requested the Central Bank for 
authority to utilize their respective dollar accounts abroad to purchase and 
repatriate to Philippine ownership 138,000 shares of Hawaiian-Philippine common 
stock at $3.55 per share. The Monetary Board of the Central Bank granted the 
request (Resolution No. 843 dated June 1, 1954) and the Earnshaws Docks utilized 
$163,012.00 of its dollar funds abroad to buy 46,000 shares of 
Hawaiian—Philippine common stocks. In August, 1955, San Carlos Planters and San 
Carlos Corporation, for themselves and on behalf of Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co., 
Far East, Ltd., Edward J. Nell &amp; Co. and Earnshaws Docks also requested the 
Central Bank for authority to purchase from non-residents 60,153 shares of San 
Carlos Milling Co. Ltd. at $10.00 per share amounting to approximately $600,000, 
of which $200,000 would be paid by the San Carlos Corporation from the dollars 
it would purchase for said purpose from the Central Bank and the balance of 
$400,000 to be paid by Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co., Far East, Ltd., Edward J. Nell 
&amp; Co. and Earnshaws Docks out of their respective dollar funds abroad. This 
request was likewise granted by the Central Bank. For the purchase of shares of 
the San Carlos Milling Co. Ltd., the Earnshaws Docks utilized $125,000 of its 
dollar commissions abroad, bringing the total foreign exchange funds used by it 
for the two transactions mentioned above to $288,012.00. EarnshWs Docks used the 
balance of its foreign funds during the same period for other purposes in 
furtherance of its business.</p>
<p>On December 22, 1955, the Central Bank demanded of Earnshaws Docks the 
payment of the 17 per cent foreign exchange tax on its dollar earnings abroad 
utilized to purchase the Hawaiian-Philippine .and San Carlos Milling Co. shares 
mentioned heretofore, as well as those utilized by it for other purposes after 
the effectivity of the foreign exchange tax law (Republic Act No. 601) totalling 
$580,048.475 or P1,160,797.65 converted at the rate of P2.015 to the dollar. The 
demand was reiterated by the Central Bank in a letter dated February 29, 1956, 
wherein Earnshaws Docks was specifically required to pay the sum of P198,695.61 
as foreign exchange tax within thirty days from receipt of said letter. In a 
letter of March 26, 1956, the Earnshaws Docks requested the Central Bank to 
reconsider its demand on the ground that the imposition of said tax was illegal 
for the reason that there was no foreign exchange purchased by the Earnshaws 
Docks from the Central Bank or its agents in the consummation of the 
transactions in question. After a denia1 of its request, Earnshaws Docks paid 
the Central Bank the amount of the tax in two installments — June 12, 1956 and 
August 31, 1956, and on June 25, 1957 filed a claim with the latter for the 
return of the amount of P198,695.61. This was denied on December 10, 1957.</p>
<p>On March 7, 1958., Earnshaws Docks filed a claim with the General Auditing 
Office for the return of said tax. Because no action was taken by the General 
Auditing Office on its claim for more than two months after its filing, the 
Earnshaws Docks instituted on May 26, 195$ an action in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila for the recovery of the claim in question (Civil Case No. 
36358) It later withdraw the action upon being notified by the General Auditing 
Office that the Central Bank had commented on its claim filed with said office. 
Thereafter Earnshaws Docks requested the General Auditing Office to rule on its 
claim, on the merits, which said Office did on October 20, 1958, the same being 
now the decision appealed from.</p>
<p>The questions raised by petitioner in the second,third, fourth and sixth 
assignments of error—which we deem to be decisive of this appeal—are related to 
each other. We shall, therefore, take them up jointly. The questions they pose 
are whether or not petitioner's dollar earnings mentioned heretofore were 
subject to the 17 per cent excise tax imposed by Republic Act No. 601, and 
consummate the two transactions involved in this case, petitioner may be deemed 
to have surrendered or sold to the Central Bank its dollar earnings aforesaid 
and then purchased from the same entity the dollars needed to pay for the shares 
it purchased.</p>
<p>It is not disputed that between March 28, 1951 and December 31, 1955 
petitioner received at its New York office as commissions the total sum of 
$580,048.475 (equivalent to P168,797.68 at the conversion rate of P2.O15 to the 
dollar). nor is it denied that said commissions were earned during the 
effectivity of Republic Act No. 601.</p>
<p>Section 1 of Republic Act No. 601, insofar as pertinent, provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Except as herein otherwise provided, there shall be assessed, collected aid 
paid a special excise tax of seventeen per centum (17%) on the value in 
Philippine peso of foreign exchange sold and/or authorized to be sold by the 
Central Bank of the Philippines or any of its agents * * *." </p></blockquote>
<p>The pertinent provisions'of Section 5 of the same Act read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The tax imposed under section one hereof shall be paid to the Central Bank 
of the Philippines by the purchaser of the foreign exchange and the Central Bank 
shall not sell any foreign exchange without the payment of the said tax. * * 
*."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Central Bank predicates its right to assess and collect the questioned 
tax upon the provisions of law quoted above and those of Section 4(a) of its 
Circular No. 20, dated December 9, 1949 (47 0ff. Gaz., November, 1951), and 
Section 2(h) of its Circular No. 42 (49 0ff. Gaz., May, 1950) to the following 
effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 4(a). All receipts of foreign exchange shall be sold daily to the 
Central Bank by those authorized to deal in exchange. <em>All receipts of 
foreign exchange by person, firm, partnership, association, branch office, 
agency company or other unincorporated body or corporation shall be sold to the 
authorized agents of the Central Bank by the recipients within one business day 
following the receipt of such foreign exchange.</em> Any person, firm, 
partnership, association, branch office, agency, company or other unincorporated 
body or corporation, residing or located within the Philippines, who acquires 
foreign exchange on and after the date of this Circular Foreign Exchange shall 
not, unless licensed by the Central Bank, dispose of such foreign exchange in 
whole or in part, nor receive less than its full value, nor delay taking 
ownership thereof except as such delay is customary; provided, further, that 
within one day upon taking ownership, or receiving payment, of foreign exchange 
the aforementioned persons and entities shall sell such foreign exchange to 
designated agents of the Central Bank (Circular No. 20; Italics ours).</p>
<p>"SEC. 2(h). The following are <em>foreign exchange transactions</em> and as 
required by Central Bank Circular No. 20, are subject to <em>prior 
licensing</em> by or on behalf of the Central Bank.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">"* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(h) all collections of residents <em>made abroad</em> through their overseas 
branch offices, agents of representatives. Such collections shall be, brought or 
ordered to be brought by such residents into the Philippines in U.S. currency 
or in other currency acceptable to the Central Bank after deducting normal 
business expenses incurred by such overseas branch offices, agents or 
representatives." (Central Bank Circular 42, Italics ours).</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner's position is that the 17% special excise tax accrues only when an 
<em>actual</em> sale of foreign exchange is made by the Central Bank or its 
authorized agents, such sale of foreign exchange being the operative fact or the 
condition that gives rise to the excise tax; that the two transactions mentioned 
above did not involve any sale or actual transfer of dollars by the Central Bank 
or any of its agents to petitioner, because the latter had not, in fact, 
purchased any dollar from the Central Bank to consummate said transactions; and 
that it was not nor could it have been the intention of Congress to impose the 
tax upon a transaction that did not involve an actual purchase of foreign 
exchange.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, the Central is that under the legal provisions quoted 
above and its Circulars Nos. 20 and 42, petitioner was under obligation to 
transfer and sell to the Central Bank , for pesos, its dollar earnings abroad; 
that to purchase the shares involved in the transactions already mentioned, 
petitioner should have filed an application for a foreign exchange license and, 
if such license was granted, it would have then purchased foreign exchange and 
paid—as petitioner admits in its brief (p. 31)—the corresponding 17 per cent 
exchange tax. In this connection the Central Bank claims that if petitioner was 
not required to follow this procedure literally or strictly by making an actual 
surrender or sale to the Central Bank of its dollar earnings abroad prior to the 
approval of the transactions herein involved, it was solely for the purpose of 
avoiding red-tape or paperwork and save trouble and time.</p>
<p>In the light of the facts before Us and the legal provisions applicable 
thereto, we are constrained to agree with the contention of the Central Bank 
and, consequently, with the decision of the respondent subject of this 
appeal.</p>
<p>Under the Central Bank circulars already referred to petitioner was under 
obligation to surrender or sell to the Central Bank its dollar earnings abroad, 
within one day after their acquisition or receipt. By applying for a Central 
Bank license or authority before utilizing said dollar earnings abroad, 
petitioner undoubtedly admitted this to be true and is now estopped to contend 
otherwise. </p>
<p>That the Central Bank had no lawful authority to waive or agree to dispense 
with this surrender or sale seems to be too obvious for argument. Much less 
could it waive in favor of any party the collection of the 17 per cent excess 
tax provided by law. It can be logically presumed, therefore, that the Central 
Bank chose not to compel petitioner to first make such actual surrender or sale 
of its dollar earnings abroad and instead gave petitioner authority to utilize 
the same for the purposes already referred to, solely for the purpose of 
expediting the transactions by avoiding the red-tape and paper-work involved. It 
cannot be denied that this was for the benefit and convenience of petitioner as 
well as of the parties from whom it purchased the shares of stock. It can not 
now take advantage of the accommodation thus granted to it by claiming that, 
because it retained ownership and possession all the time of its dollar earnings 
abroad and it had made no <em>actual</em> surrender or sale thereof to the 
Central Bank, it is not liable for the payment of the 17 per cent exchange tax 
on the amounts utilized by it for the purchase of the shares of stock and for 
other purposes already mentioned above. As already stated, before purchasing the 
shares of Hawaiian—Philippine and San Carlos Milling Co., Ltd., petitioner 
applied for authority from the Central Bank to utilize its dollar earnings 
abroad for that purpose. Petitioner would not have asked for such authority if 
it did not consider itself bound firstly, to surrender or sell such dollar 
earnings to the Central Bank and secondly, to purchase, thereafter, the dollars 
it needed to consummate the proposed transactions. Consequently, its request or 
petition for authority to utilize its dollar earnings; the leave granted by the 
Central Bank, and the subsequent use by petitioner of said dollar earnings must 
be deemed equivalent to, and involving first, the surrender or sale of such 
dollar earnings to the Central Bank and then the purchase by petitioner of the 
dollars it needed to consummate the transactions; for otherwise we would be 
sanctioning an arrangement violative of the provisions of law and of the 
dispositions contained in the Central Bank Circulars mentioned heretofore.</p>
<p>In the first assignment of error it is contended that respondent should have 
ruled that petitioner and the other parties to the two transactions involved in 
this case were made to understand that no taxes would be imposed on them by the 
Central Bank. We find this to be without merit. The record does not disclose 
affirmatively any promise made by the Central Bank in the sense claimed by 
petitioner and, as stated heretofore, any such promise made by the Central Bank 
would have been void for lack of legal authority to make it. The State cannot be 
precluded or barred from collecting the tax due simply by reason of the unlawful 
acts of its agents. <br></p><p>In the view we take of the case, we deem it unnecessary to 
resolve the question involved in the first assignment of error. </p>
<p>Wherefore, finding the decision of respondent subject of the present appeal 
to be in accordance with law, the same is hereby affirmed, with 
costs.</p><em>Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Paredes,</em> and <em>De Leon, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
