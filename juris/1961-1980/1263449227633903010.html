versus Manila Railroad Company and its subsidiary Manila Port Service,
condemning the defendants to pay the plaintiff the total sum of <span style="">P2<span class="GramE">,490.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 16, 1960, the plaintiff, as successor-­in-interest

filed a complaint with three causes of action to recover an aggregate amount of
P4<span class="GramE">,910.24</span>, represent­ing the value of portions of
goods allegedly short-<span style="">delivered and/or damaged in shipments discharged by the carrying vessels
to the custody of the defendants as operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service at the port of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><span style="">due time, </span><span style="">the defendants
answered the complaint. </span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">Thereafter, the parties submitted a stipulation of

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1964</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered the decision appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>appears from the
stipulation of facts of the parties and the brief filed by their respective
coun­sels, the facts of the case which are not <span class="GramE">disputed,</span>
are <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the First Cause of Action -</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1960</st1:date>,
the vessel <span style="">S/S </span>"President
Pierce" docked at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>
carrying a ship­ment of 400 bags of synthetic resins ("UNION CARBIDE"
Polyethylene DND-0400, Natural) consigned to Mahogany Products Philippines,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It discharged the cargo un­to the
custody of the Manila Port Service, operator (under contract with the Manila
Railroad Company) of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>, on <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="2">February <span style="">8, </span>1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The customs broker for the consignee filed a
provisional claim on <st1:date year="1960" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1960</st1:date>,
advising the American President Lines and/or the Manila Port Service, that its
shipment has been <span class="SpellE">shortlanded</span> and/or landed in bad
order, and that it will file a formal claim for the loss or damage
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisional claim was re­ceived
by the Manila Port Service on <st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="2">February
 22, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the 400
bag-shipment, only 356 bags were delivered by the Manila Port Service on <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1960</st1:date> to the consignee <span class="GramE">which</span> subsequently filed a formal claim for its loss or
damage on <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1960</st1:date>,
against said <span class="SpellE">arras­tre</span> operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, as
insurer of the cargo, paid the loss of the consignee, and was thereby subro­gated
to its rights against the appellants Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad
Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Second Cause of Action -</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1960</st1:date>,
the vessel <span style="">S/S </span>"<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Aurora" arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> carrying a shipment of
three (3) boxes containing a <st1:place><st1:placename>Cooking</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Range</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
an Oven, and a Refrigerator Freezer consigned to Nancy Brown <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Turla</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cargo was discharged unto the custody of the Manila Port Service on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="5"><span style="">May 11,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only two (2) of the three (3) boxes
aforementioned were delivered by the Manila Port Service to the consignee under
"per­mit to deliver imported goods" dated </span><st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="5"><span style="">May 12, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Seven days after, or on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="19" month="5"><span style="">May 19, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, consignee's attorney-in-fact filed a
provisional claim with the Manila Port Service for whatever loss or damage that
may be sustained by the consignee, followed by a formal claim for loss on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="5"><span style="">May 28,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, as
insurer of the goods, paid the loss to </span><span style="">Nancy </span><span style="">Brown <span class="SpellE">Turla</span> on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="7"><span style="">July 5, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, and thereby </span><span style="">became </span><span style="">subrogated to the
rights of the consignee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Third Cause of Action -</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1960</st1:date>,
the vessel S/S "Pioneer Mill" arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> carrying a ship­ment of
34 cartons of Dry Batteries consigned to Asso­ciated Trading Corporation, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1960</st1:date>, the Manila Port Service received from the con­signee a
provisional claim dated <st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="2">February 22,
 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire shipment of
34 cartons of Dry Batteries appears to have been discharged by the carrying
vessel unto the custody of the Manila Port Service on <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only 19 cartons of the 34-carton shipment,
however, was delivered to the consignee on the 24th of that month, and
thereafter the consignee filed a formal claim for loss on July 12, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like in the two previous in­stances
aforementioned, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, as insurer of the
shipment, paid the loss to the consignee, and was there­by subrogated to its
rights against herein appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their supplementary <span style="">stipulation
</span>of facts, the parties agreed that should the appellants finally be held
answerable for the loss of or damage to the goods in question, their liability
should be limited to P1,140.00, P500.00, and P850.00 under the First, Second
and Third Causes of Action, respectively, pursuant to the provisions of Section
15 of the Management Contract between the Manila Railroad Company and the
Manila Port Service; and for its part, plaintiff admitted that it had knowledge
of, and is bound by the terms and condi­tions set forth under said Section 15
of the agreement adverted to above, particularly the time limit within which a
claim for loss or damage against the defendants as operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the port of Mani­la, should be filed or
prosecuted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue now brought before Us is, whether under the foregoing
antecedents of the case, there was sub­stantial compliance with the requirement
of filing claims against the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator
(defendants) with­in fifteen (15) days from the date of discharge of the last
package from the carrying vessel <span style="">as </span>provided
for in the management contract aforementioned, when the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
or its predecessors-in-interest filed the so-called "provisional
claims" in the instances narrated under the three (3) separate causes of
action in <span class="SpellE">appel­lee's</span> complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pertinent portions of Section 15 of the Manage­ment Contract in
question read:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"15. It is
further understood and strictly agreed that the CONTRACTOR shall <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>pay to the steamship
company, consignee, consignor or other interested party or parties the invoice
value of each package but which in no case shall be more than five hundred
(P500.00) for each pack­age unless the value is otherwise specified or
manifested, and the corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges
had been paid, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; </span>in any
event the CON­TRACTOR shall be relieved and released of any and all
responsibility or lia­bility for loss, damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span>,
and/or non-delivery of goods, unless suit in the court of proper jurisdic­tion
is brought within a period of one (1) year from the date of the discharge of
the goods, or from the date when the claim for the value of such goods have
been rejected or denied by the CONTRACTOR, <u><span style="">provided that such claim shall have been filed with the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CONTRACTOR within fifteen (15) days<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from the date of discharge of the last
package from the carrying vessel</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span><span class="GramE">(Underscoring Ours.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the first time that this question has been brought
before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
long line of cases, We have invariably held that filing of a "provisional
claim" within fifteen (15) days from the date of discharge of the last
package from the carrying vessel is a suffi­cient compliance with the
requirement of Section 15 of the aforesaid management contract (United
Insurance Company, Inc. vs. Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines,
et al., L­-22688, April 27, 1967; Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., et al. vs.
Manila Port Service, L-21907, April 29, 1966; State Bonding &amp; Insurance
Co., Inc. vs. Manila Port Service, L-21833, February 28, 1966; Yu <span class="SpellE">Kimteng</span> Construction Corp. <span style="">vs. </span>MRR, L-17027, November 29, 1965; G.S.I.S. vs. MRR, L-20342,
November 29, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance
that the provisional claim did not specify the value of the loss still
substantially fulfills the requirements of the contract aforementioned (State Bonding
&amp; Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port Service, <u>supra</u>), and is not a
defense against the claim of the consignee for recovery after it shall have
ascertained later its actual loss or damage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the amounts awarded to herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
under its First and Second Causes of Action, therefore, the lower court did not
commit error in ordering the herein appellants to pay the Domestic Insurance
Company the amounts of P1,140.00 and P500.00, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the award of P850.00 to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
under the Third Cause of Action, however, the same is not warranted under the
circumstances of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal
relation of the parties should be governed by a different rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A claim for loss or damage under the
provisional claim filed <u>before</u> the date of discharge of the last package
from the carrying vessel, is not a sub­stantial compliance with the requirement
of Section 15 of the Management Contract under consideration, because it is
"premature and speculative" (Shell Co. of the Philippines, Ltd. vs. <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> General de <span class="SpellE">Tobacos</span> de Filipinas,
L-20230, July 30, 1965; Fireman's Fund In­surance Co. vs. Manila Port Service,
et al., L-22454, April 29, 1966; <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Surety &amp;
Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Manila Railroad and Manila Port Service, L-22409, April
27, 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule, however, was qualified
in New Hampshire Fire Insurance Co. vs. Manila Port Ser­vice, et al. (L-20938,
August 9, 1966), where this Tribunal made <span style="">a </span>distinction between two instances,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) where the provisional claim
is <span style="">filed </span>ahead of the date of
the discharge of the last package from the car­rying vessel but the consignee
has not yet examined or was not yet informed of the condition of the shipment,
the provisional claim is held to be speculative and premature; and (2) where
the claim is filed also be­fore the date of the discharge of the last package
from the carrying vessel and the consignee has in fact discovered or was
informed of <span style="">a
</span>shortage or damage to the goods before the discharge of the last
package, or during the unloading, then the provisional claim is deemed to have
been properly presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">But even </span>applying this latter
principle to the case at bar, We find no showing that would sustain, much less,
justify the award of P850.00 to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> under
its Third Cause of Action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed
its provi­sional claim one (1) day before the cargo treated <span class="SpellE">there­under</span>
was actually discharged from the carrying vessel on <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, the said provision­al claim
bears the earmarks of a "stereo-type" one, because it is dated and appears
to have been made or prepared on February 22, 1960, showing the impossibi­lity
of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> or its predecessor-in-interest’s having
known or been informed at the time about the alleged loss or damage to its
shipment, for the S/S "Pioneer Mill" which carried the cargo in
question docked at the port of Manila only on February 24, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This leaves no room for doubt that the claim
was prema­ture and speculative, and cannot be legally considered as <span style="">a </span>substantial
compliance with the requirement of the management contract that the claim
should be filed within fifteen days <u>from</u> the date of discharge of the
last package from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither would the formal claim for the missing articles filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1960</st1:date>, cure the defect as the
date is clearly beyond the 15-day period aforementioned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For all the foregoing considerations</b>, the deci­sion
appealed from is hereby modified, in the sense that the P850.00 awarded to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> under its Third Cause of Action is eliminated, but
affirmed with respect to the amounts of P1<span class="GramE">,140.00</span> and
P500.00 grant­ed under the First and Second Causes of Action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
