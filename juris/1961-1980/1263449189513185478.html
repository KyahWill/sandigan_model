<p class="BODY">Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's brief assails the probative value of the People's
evidence, challenges the Court's findings, and seeks acquittal.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The People's case was built mainly on the testimony of four (4)
witnesses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the three (3) pointing the
finger of guilt at Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> <u>alone</u>; the
fourth <u>solely</u> at <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>.
Repro­duced here is the version of each.</p>

<p class="BODY">LUCIANO PUNZALAN - The afternoon of that day, his wife Maria <span class="SpellE">Musñgi</span> suffered stomach ache with abnormal bowel movements,
in their home in barrio <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Anao</span></st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Mexico</st1:country-region></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to
the house of Juan David located in the same barrio, and borrowed the latter's
jeep to take his wife to Dr. Logan at <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30</st1:time> that same night, the jeep
started from <span class="SpellE">Anao</span> on its way to <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Following were the occupants of the jeep:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose David, son of Juan David, was at the wheel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To his right on the driver's seat was Maria <span class="SpellE">Musñgi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the right
of Maria <span class="SpellE">Musñgi</span> on the same seat was <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> Gonzales. Behind <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span>
Gonzales on the right side of the jeep was <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
left of <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> was Gregorio Guevara.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the left of Gregorio was Miguel <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
left side of the jeep opposite the last three, were Antonia <span class="SpellE">Malla­ri</span>
who sat immediately behind Jose David.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To the right of Antonia was a vacant seat; and occupying the left rear
corner seat of the jeep was Andres David, brother of Jose David.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some 14 or 15 meters from Km. post 80, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time>, the jeep reached a
depression in the road about 1-1/2 feet deep and 2 meters wide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the jeep was moving down slowly into that
hole, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> suddenly appeared between
Antonia <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> and Andres David on the left side of
the jeep, outside, "holding a gun [which according to him was a revolver,
with a barrel as big as his forefinger and about 4 inches in length], and
pointing it at the back of Jose David." There was an interval of
"[a]bout one (1) minute or even less" from the time <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> pointed the revolver to the time he fired the
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jeep traveled a distance of
about 2-1/2 meters and stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the shot, <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> ran to the left shoulder of the
road, where there was cogon grass, and towards the field.</p>

<p class="BODY">Four (4) of <span class="SpellE">Punzalan's</span> companions,
Gregorio Guevara, Antonia <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> and Andres David, alighted, went to the barrio to
get help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>
and his wife proceeded to <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his wife was attended to by Dr. Logan
that same night, he took her back to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">ANDRES DAVID - This 18-year old younger brother of Jose David
corroborated <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>
up to the point when the shot was fired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His version is that as they were nearing a hole in the road at the place
indicated by <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>, he heard a shot or an
explosion. He thought it was a blowout.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not see <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> fire the shot. He stuck
his head out of the left side of the jeep and, in so doing, "saw Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>" more or less two meters away "somewhat
facing us still." <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> ran to the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did
not notice whether <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was carrying a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having heard his brother Jose David moaning,
he alighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw Jose leaning for
support on the steering wheel and praying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jose told him to fetch their father because he was injured and to get
another jeep to take him away. The four riders heretofore mentioned proceeded
to the barrio. Andres told everybody he met that his brother was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked his uncle <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
David to relay to the temporary policemen (T. P's.) the news "that my
brother had been shot." Catching up with the jeep his father, the
temporary policemen, and one <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> were on, they went back to Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lifted his brother who was taken to the
second station hospital in <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>
where they were told to take him to the provincial hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">While his brother was in the emergency room, Mayor Padilla of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and some companions came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He led them to
the place of the incident, told the mayor:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Here is where <u>they</u> shot my brother."</p>

<p class="BODY">GREGORIO GUEVARA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Also
one of those in the jeep, this witness declared that between barrios <span class="SpellE">Anao</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city>
he heard a shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taken aback, his first
impulse was to jump out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not do
so, because he saw defendant <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> <u>for the first
time</u> about 3 meters to the left towards the rear running away, and he
feared <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> "might think I was chasing
him." When the jeep stopped he, with others, left for the barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not notice if <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
was carrying anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <u>only</u>
saw <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">MIGUEL LAXAMANA - This witness had another story to tell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the jeep was about to go down a hole in
the road in an uninhabited place, he heard an explosion from the left side of
the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He looked around</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw "somebody lying face down towards
the rear of the jeep," about two meters <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was about to alight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that he recognized that person to
be the defendant <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not see <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>
do anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he see where <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> went to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> "was no longer" in the
place he ran towards home.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. We are at grips with the serious problem of ascertaining
whether credence should be accorded the witnesses just mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pertinent to recall is that <u>only one</u>, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>, testified to having seen the actual act of
shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two who corroborated him,
Andres David and Gregorio Guevara, allegedly took note of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan's</span>
presence <u>after</u> the shot was fired and the fourth did not see <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, <u>only</u> saw <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>,
the acquitted defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conduct
observed by all of these witnesses following the shooting is quite revealing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the gruesome incident that <span class="SpellE"><u>Luciano</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span></u> witnessed, he sealed his lips as to who
shot Jose David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night, he never
mentioned the name of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> to his
companions in the jeep or to anybody else, not even to Juan David, Jose's
father who brought Jose to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first time he revealed the identity of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
was four (4) days after May 19 the day Jose was buried, and solely to one
person, Juan David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reason was that
every member of the fa­mily of Juan David was very angry and he was afraid to
reveal the iden­tity of the culprit sooner as "something also untoward
would even happen," and "[t]he situation might be aggravated."</p>

<p class="BODY">How about <u>Andres David</u>?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here is what he said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
hospital at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of May 16,
he revealed to his brother, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Res­tituto</span>
David, one of the four private prosecutors, that it was Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> who shot his brother Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. David counseled Andres not to talk too
loud and not to tell their father about <span class="SpellE">Cunanan's</span>
identity "because this thing might grow worse and it is impossible that he
was alone." It was only after he was investigated by the Constabulary on
May 19th that he told his father that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was the
perpetrator of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reason for
so divulging was that then he (father) "was no longer very angry after my
brother had been interred." He did not tell Mayor Padilla the identity of
the culprit because, again in his own words, "my secret plan was to get
him man to man and take vengeance against him."</p>

<p class="BODY">Along the same lines, the other witness <u>Gregorio Guevara</u>
gave this version:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after the
shot was fired, he "did not hear anyone talk" about the possible
culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was with the group of four
who returned to the barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the store
where he sat in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Anao</span> he kept silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night he did not tell Andres David - a
companion of his in the jeep, brother of Jose - that he saw <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.
Even his wife was not informed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the
other witnesses, he feared vengeance of Jose's family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on the 20th of May that he opened
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reason was that the Constabulary
was already investigating him and by that time he was confident that the ire of
the David family would have subsided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then, too, "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]t <u>was possible</u>
that after that period, I was no longer afraid [of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>],
because I was already with the authorities."</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Miguel <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span></u>, for his part,
declared that that night he told Juan David that his son Jose met with some
misfortune, not that he saw <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>; and that <u>all</u>
that Andres David then informed his father Juan David was that "his elder
brother [Jose] had been shot" - and no more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> further
narrated that he told nobody that he saw <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only after Jose's burial that he revealed the presence of <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>
to the private prosecutor and to the provincial fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span></u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- who claims he saw <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
in the barrio short­ly after the crime holding a gun wrapped in a piece of
spotted black and white piece of cloth - likewise mentioned to no one that he
saw <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> on the night Jose David was treacherously
killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He divulged what he did
allegedly knew only on May 19 when Jose was interred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pattern of conduct of the five witnesses just related, cannot
but evoke comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four of them have
one stock excuse for not revealing the culprit - afraid that the family of Jose
David would wreak vengeance, take the law into their hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is quite difficult to be­lieve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How easy would it have been for anyone of
them to whisper to the mayor, to the chief of police, to the policemen, to the <span class="SpellE">CCU's</span> and to the temporary police, who were at the scene
or, for that matter, to the barrio lieutenant Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>
- that the real culprit was <span class="SpellE">Cu­nanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, to the end that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
could be safely held in prison or in the constabulary barracks, and thus
prevent him from frustrating justice by flight or taking vengeance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The threadbare excuse of <u>Gregorio Guevara</u> that he feared
the ire of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> is notches below the level of the
probable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right from the start, the
Mayor, the Chief of Police and the Constabulary took a hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 17, the barrio was patrolled by the Constabulary
sol­diers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record suggests
that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> is a violent man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he was, the slashing of his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> (he is a farmer) prior to this in­cident by
prosecution witness Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> could have
given him a <span class="SpellE"><u>casus</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">belli</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Guevara could well obtain
protection from Juan David who, the record discloses, is a man who throws his
weight around.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recitals of these witnesses just mentioned - five of them -
bordering on conspiracy of silence, raise grave doubts as to the vera­city of
their statement that they saw <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> that night the
crime occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, reason exists
for an impartial observer to say that all of them crossed the boundaries of
credibility.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Quite apart from the foregoing, disturbing circumstances there
are which induce rational belief that Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
was not really iden­tified as the man who shot at and killed Jose David.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>. In the verified statement given on <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1957</st1:date>, by Miguel <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, the following appear:</p>

<blockquote>"Q - Aside from
CLEMENTE MANALOTO were you not able to see whether he (C. MANALOTO) has any
companion?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A - <u>None</u>, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Miguel <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, it should be
remembered, was on the right side of the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The People's evidence is that Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
appeared about two meters on the left side of the jeep between Antonia <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> and Andres David and tarried for sometime before he
fired the gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
was facing the left side and <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was in the range
of his vision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stands to reason to
say then that if <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> declared that he saw nobody
except the other defendant <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> - who had no com­panion - we have a case where in
reality Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was not iden­tified as the
one who shot Jose David.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>. In the morning of <st1:date year="1957" day="17" month="5">the 17th of May, 1957</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Mana­loto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> were together in a jeep going from barrio <span class="SpellE">Anao</span> to <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They talked about the incident the night
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following from the
conversation between the two who are friends and <span class="SpellE"><u>compadres</u></span>,

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>. Contrary to the testimony of the People's
witnesses, chief of police Felipe P. Salas assured the Court that that night of
May 16th was "very dark." The chief added that "we could not
write because it was very dark." And yet, prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> and Gregorio
Guevara could say that on that night <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was
wearing yellow (<span class="SpellE"><u>culyawan</u></span>) short-sleeved polo
shirt, with khaki pants and with particularity that he wore no hat and was
unshod.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This shakes confidence on their
truthfulness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They obviously overshot
their mark.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fourth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> saw that <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> used a

<p class="BODY"><u>Fifth</u>. We come to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balajadia's</span>
narrative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness is a brother-in-law
and a bodyguard of Juan David, father of the deceased Jose David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that early in the evening of <st1:date year="1957" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1957</st1:date> while he was in the
house of <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span> in
barrio <span class="SpellE">Anao</span>, the wife of Michael del Rosario who was
in a nearby house looked out of the win­dow and told him that his <span class="SpellE"><u>compadre</u></span> "<span class="SpellE">Padil</span>"
(Jose David) was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went down <span class="SpellE">Guinto's</span> house and proceeded home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Near the residence of Alfredo de Guzman he
saw defendant <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> leaning against the fence, left
hand in his left pants pocket and right hand behind him holding a gun wrapped
in a piece of spotted (black dots) and white cloth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He dec­lared that he saw the barrel of the
gun which was black in color, pro­truding two inches, as also the butt of the
gun which was held in the middle portion by <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is what <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span>
told the Court -</p>

<blockquote>"COURT:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> was trapped in the <span class="SpellE">bogholes</span> of exaggeration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following from his affidavit given on <st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1957</st1:date> betrays him, thus: -</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You stated that when

<p class="BODY">Not that <span class="SpellE">Balajadia's</span> testimony given in
court is surprising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was previously
accused by <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> for slashing <span class="SpellE">Cunanan's</span>
<span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was prosecuted in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan David
intervened to settle the matter and <span class="SpellE">Cu­nanan</span>
refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was convicted by the
Municipal Court of Mexico.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Sixth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us pause
to consider <span class="SpellE">Cunanan's</span> situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> had
reason to believe that he was identified that night as the culprit, it is not
likely that immediately after the crime he should have tarried and exposed himself
to the danger of being caught, if not liquidated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This detracts any driving force from what <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> just related.</p>

<p class="BODY">Andres David testified that on the morning of May 17th - the day
after the crime - <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> <u>alone</u> visited the
house where the deceased Jose David was lying in state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Andres started hitting <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
with his fists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was held back by
somebody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to chase <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
prevented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hit <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
because "it was he who had shot my brother." It is interesting to
note that then his father Juan David did not ask him why he gave fist blows to <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first instinct of man is self-preservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was the
author of the crime, or that he felt that someone could have seen him commit
the crime, it is improbable that he should have the te­merity to have exposed
himself to the danger of being the object of vengeance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Seventh</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
night of the crime - May 16 - chief of police Felipe P. Salas of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was notified thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his policemen
<span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Musngi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nicdao</span> and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Gozon</span>, together with Mayor Padilla, he rushed to the scene
of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came upon a parked
jeep, and there he met the victim's brother Andres David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He interrogated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David told the chief that he did not know who
the culprit was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He investigated five
passengers of the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They likewise
disclaimed knowledge of the identity of the assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
asked who shot Jose David, <span class="SpellE">Punza­lan's</span> answer to
Chief Salas, like that of Andres David and others, was that he did not know,
and that "they did not see (other) persons other than the passengers of
the jeep." That same night he went to the hos­pital but the doctor on duty
told him that the victim was in a serious condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, he instructed Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Gozon</span> to prepare a report for the PC and to enter the
incident in the police blotter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
report was made, checked and signed by the chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he stated that Jose David was shot by
an unknown assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entry in page
40 of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="BODY">The chief of police had no motive to falsify the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why, he even asked municipal judge Xerxes Garcia
to forward the papers to the fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
least that can be said is that he had regularly performed his duties.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Here, proof of identification is not convincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, nothing in the record would as much as intimate such a mo­tive
on the part of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> to kill Jose
David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose David's widow, Bella Guevara
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de David, assured the court that there was no
misunderstanding between Jose David and <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, and
that they were intimate <span class="SpellE">barriomates</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Hajan</span>, <u>supra</u> - a
case for murder - this court said (p. 547) that "though proof of motive is
not indispensable to conviction, yet a void in the evidence in this respect
discloses a weakness in the case for the prosecution."</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Why then was the accusing finger pointed at <span class="SpellE"><u>Cunanan</u></span>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Manaloto</u></span>? Juan David, father of the
deceased, is the local President of the Catholic Action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> are the
followers of the religious group known as "<span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span>
Ni <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span>." The following culled from the
decision below is interesting:</p>

<blockquote>"As disclosed by the prosecution, the people of <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Anao</span></st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Mexico</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, have taken sides and have divided them­selves
into two groups on a religious issue - the Catholic segment, on the one hand;
and the members of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Ni <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span>,
on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such has been the feeling
engen­dered by the feuding factions that personal violence seemed inevitable.
Thus, it has been shown by the testimony of the barrio lieutenant of <span class="SpellE">Anao</span>, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>, a witness
of the prosecution, that Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Sinamban</span>, a
follower of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span>, stabbed <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiamson</span>, a Catholic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another incident with a religious taint occurred in con­nection
with the image of the Virgin de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> for which the Catholics gaily decorated the
barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It seems</u> that the bamboo
fence that was erected along the road thru which the image would pass, was
pulled out by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cu­nanan</span> in front of his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On being asked the reason for
this conduct, <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, according to Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>, sar­castically inquired of him why he had allowed
himself to be fooled by "<span class="SpellE">Mariang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulugan</span>", alluding to the virgin.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>What appears, however, to have heightened the pas­sion came about
as a result of the public meeting which was organized and held by the Catholics
in which Juan David, father of the victim, Jose David, was elected their spokes­man
and in which it was agreed that the Catholics shall re­frain from dealing
directly with members of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action, which the opposing sect called a
boycott, was so resented that one of their active members, Primo del Rosario,
was said to have remarked, according to <span class="SpellE">Casimi­ro</span> <span class="SpellE">Guintu</span>, another witness of the prosecution, to the ef­fect
that until they succeeded in killing one of the <span class="SpellE">Davids</span>,
they would not stop."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, in addition to the
incident about the virgin just related, there is the circumstance that Juan
David tried to settle the criminal case between his brother-in-law and
bodyguard Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> and defendant <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> in reference to the slashing by <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan's</span> <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> mentioned
earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
refused and Juan David got angry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motive
to kill can hardly be deduced from the facts just recited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the axe has to fall on someone.</p>

<p class="BODY">No wonder, when asked why he was charged with the instant crime,
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> could only surmise - "it was
said [by "our barrio mates there"] that <u>we</u> were the ones who
killed."</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The defense is alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Witness Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Escoto</span>, a student teacher of <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Ni <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> who was
assigned to <span class="SpellE">Anao</span>, testified that Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> arrived at the chapel of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span>
Ni <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00

 16, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Ni <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> chapel was in
the house of Primo del Rosario in <span class="SpellE">Anao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two of them did not leave the chapel
until about <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> or <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> in the evening after the services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1957" day="16" month="5">May

</span>And, the services of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Ni <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> is held on Thursdays and Sundays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presence of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> was
neces­sary because they were deacons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two of them made the collections between <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time>
that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the services
ended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony finds
corroboration in <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> del Rosario, another <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> Ni <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span> member, who was
also in the chapel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the two
defendants similarly testified.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> an
accused cannot be convicted on the basis of evidence which, independent of his
alibi, is weak, uncorroborated, and inconclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily
proven was never intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases;
otherwise, we will see the absurdity of an accused being put in a more
difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than
where it is strong."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">7. The natural reaction of one who witnesses a crime is to reveal
it to the authorities, unless, of course, he is the author thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It defies credulity that not one or two but <u>five</u>
such witnesses made no effort to expose <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> if
they really knew that he was the author thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This stultified silence casts grave doubts as
to their veracity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the end, we have here a specific case where evidence of identi­fication
is thoroughly unreliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No valid explanation was given why the

<p class="BODY">As we look in retrospect, we come to the conclusion that the
remaining defendant Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> was convicted
below <u>more</u> on evidence riddled with serious doubts and not entirely free
from suspicion, <u>than</u> the commanding weight of proof beyond reasonable
