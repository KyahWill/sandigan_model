				<H3>CANDIDA REYES, IN HER OWN BEHALF AND AS GUARDIAN AD LITEM; EDGARDO SO, RENATO SO, ROMEO REYES SO, ALL MINORS, AND SO YONG GA, PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, VS. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>In the Court of First Instance of Manila, appellants filed against appellees, 
particularly the Civil Registrar of Manila, Special Civil Case No. 40166 wherein 
it is alleged among other things that Candida Reyes is a Filipino citizen; that 
Edgardo So, Renato So and Romeo So, were born to her outside of wedlock with 
petitioner So Yong Ga, a Chinese subject; that in such circumstances, said minor 
children <i>are citizens of the Philippines;</i> and that they were erroneously 
entered as Chinese citizens in the civil register of Manila. Wherefore, 
petitioners prayed that the said entries <i>be ordered corrected.</i></p>
<p>Upon appellees' motion to dismiss on the ground that it stated no cause of 
action, the <i>petition was dismissed</i>; and a motion for reconsideration was 
denied. </p>
<p>Petitioners appealed to this Court, excepting to the order of dismissal. </p>
<p>They argue now that Article 412 of the Civil Code of the Philippines under 
which they sought relief <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> makes no 
distinction whatsoever as to the kind of errors which may he corrected in a 
civil register; that the only condition precedent to such correction is that 
there should be a corresponding judicial order; that where mere clerical errors 
are sought to be corrected, such correction may be authorized by means of a 
summary proceeding; that the instant petition is in faithful compliance with the 
"appropriate action" contemplated and suggested by this Court in various 
cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [2]</sup> decided on the same issue; that 
as shown by the petition, the parties involved, namely, the parents and children 
as petitioners and the Republic of the Philippines and the Civil Register as 
respondents, were included therein; and as alleged in paragraph 6 thereof, the 
Philippine citizenship of minor children may be established by adequate 
evidence. </p>
<p>In our view, the instant action seeks a declaration of Philippine citizenship 
of some minor children. And we have invariably held <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>, only mistakes that are <i>clerical</i> in 
nature may be ordered corrected under Article 412 of the Civil Code of the 
Philippines. The procedure contemplated under this provision of law is summary 
in nature. </p>
<p>If the petition, on the other hand pursues the correction of entries that are 
substantial, the erroneous entry may be corrected by the Court by means of a 
<i>proper action</i> according to the nature of the issues in controversy and 
wherein all the parties who may be affected by the entries are notified or 
represented and evidence submitted to prove the allegations of the complaint, 
and proof to the contrary admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p>
<p>The case before us is not of first impression. We have repeatedly declared 
that in this jurisdiction, the remedy Sought in the instant petition cannot be 
granted in the manner desired. While ostensibly, the action seeks a mere 
correction of an entry in the Civil Registry, in effect, it requests the 
judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship. Many such cases, this Court has 
dismissed. We have clearly stated time and again, that declaratory relief is not 
available for the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration of citizenship. 
</p>
<p>It may be stated at this juncture that Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court 
provides for the cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry 
relating to civil status. Any person interested in any act, event, order or 
decree concerning the civil status of persons Which has been recorded in the 
Civil Registry, may file a Verified petition for the cancellation or correction 
of any entry relating thereto. The entries which may be cancelled or corrected 
are specifically enumerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> While 
"birth" is mentioned as one of the entries that may be corrected or cancelled, 
this includes only such particulars as are attendant to birth. Other details, 
such as nationality or citizenship arc not included. Rule 108 also covers 
citizenship but only as regards its election, loss or recovery. But this 
certainly has no relevance to the instant petition, which, as hitherto stated, 
seeks a judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p>For the reasons indicated, the order appealed from is affirmed with costs 
against petitioners. </p><i>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,
