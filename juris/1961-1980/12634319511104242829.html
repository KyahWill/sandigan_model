				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a rape case involving a thirteen-year-old, mentally
retarded girl named Therese <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span>, the daughter of
the spouses, Jerome <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They resided at <st1:street><st1:address>10 Padre Burgos Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
near <st1:street><st1:address>Aurora Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>,
Project 4, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therese, who was born in <st1:place><st1:city>Chicago</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>Illinois</st1:state></st1:place>, is a fair complexioned girl with <span class="SpellE">mestiza</span> features.</p>

<p class="BODY">Residing in the same neighborhood in an apartment identified as
1021-M <st1:city><st1:place>Aurora</st1:place></st1:city> Boulevard, near the
Marian Bakery, also in Project 4, was a nineteen-year-old, unmarried boy named
Winston <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> who was studying electrical
engineering in the University of the East.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That apartment was about five hundred meters away from the residence of
Therese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nearby, on <st1:street><st1:address>Calderon
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, was a basketball court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Winston stayed in the apartment with his elder sister, <span class="SpellE">Bituin</span> <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, 30, an employee
of the Universal Textile Mills at <span class="SpellE">Barranca</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has <span class="SpellE">mestizo</span>
features also, being the son of an American mother and a Filipino father who
lived in <span class="SpellE">Uson</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Winston and Therese met at the bas­ketball
court in November, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They became
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therese came to know the
residence of Winston.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went there two
or three times with her neighbor, Vicky, and her friend, Robin, a
teenager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She got acquainted with
Winston' s sister.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the prosecution, Winston had sexual inter­course
with Therese in his apartment in the afternoon of Novem­ber 28 and 30,
1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Winston denied that he had sexual
inter­course with Therese but that denial does not merit any credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admits that Therese was in his apartment
on those two after­noons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the
sexual intercourse was consummated by the use of force is not clear since the
only witness on that point is Therese herself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Due to her mental handicap, she was not able to give a coherent, clear
and consistent narrative as to how she was ravished by Winston.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span>, since
infancy, Therese has a speech impediment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She could not talk when she was already two years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she grew older, she spoke in broken
sentences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was enrolled in different
schools but, as her mother noted, she could not cope or keep up with the other
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her parents were advised to
enroll her in a special school.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the age of seven years, or during the school years, 1966-67,
1969-70, 1970-71, 1971-72 and the second semester of 1972-73.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therese was enrolled in the Saint Joseph of
Cupertino School for retarded children located at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street>, La Vista
Subdivision, <st1:place><st1:placename>Loyola</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Heights</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Doctor Fernando <span class="SpellE">Hofileña</span>, a
pediatrician with orienta­tion in child psychiatry and experience in the
treatment of mentally retarded children, was the clinical head of the Saint
Joseph of Cupertino School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therese was
examined by Doctor <span class="SpellE">Hofileña</span> and by a psychologist, a
special teacher, a social worker and a guidance counselor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doctor <span class="SpellE">Hofileña</span>
concluded that Therese has an unsound mind, meaning that she has a mental
deficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified on
cross-examination:</p>

<blockquote>"Q. Doctor, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> based on your answer as an expert, will you please
tell the Court whether or not Therese is pos­sessed with (of) a sound or
unsound mind? x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. - A. -
I believe she has an unsound mind.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. Are you certain of that,
Doctor? - A. Yes, sir." (38-39 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As clinical head of the school, he issued a certificate dated <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1973</st1:date>, or fifty-four days
after the commission of the alleged rape, stating that Therese had been
diagnosed "as mentally retarded of the educable type" and as a
"speech-defective" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).</p>

<p class="BODY">Doctor <span class="SpellE">Hofileña</span> ventured the opinion
that Therese might not completely understand the nature and consequences of
sexual intercourse (41-42 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>) or has only a vague
notion that sexual intercourse is bad (49-50 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>) or
is not possessed of mental capacity to judge for herself whether sexual
intercourse is good or bad (50 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>) or may give her
consent to a request without much deliberation and without knowing the
consequences of her assent (49 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Leticia Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Lizaso</span>, the directress
of the school, confirmed the findings of Doctor <span class="SpellE">Hofileña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She certified that "psychometric tests
taken (in) 1971 revealed <u>Therese's mental age as five years and 2 months</u>
and level of intellectual func­tioning to be mentally defective in the educable
level" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That conclusion was based on the report of Carolina Chan, the
psychologist who examined Therese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tests were given by Maria Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span>, the
guidance counselor of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Madonna</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Center</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> recounted in court how
she came to know that Therese had sexual intercourse with Winston.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On New Year's Day, <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1973</st1:date>, while Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span>
was cleaning her house, she found two white pills in the locker of
Therese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she queried her daughter
as to the function of the pills, Therese answered that the pills "were for
not having a baby" or were contraceptive pills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> found
out that her daughter got the pills from Winston and that Therese had sexual
intercourse with him two times.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> consulted her relatives
as to the proper course or action to take under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her uncle-in-law, former Justice Pastor <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span>, accompanied her to the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
prosecuting officer advised them to go to the Detective Bureau.</p>

<p class="BODY">A detective took down the statement of Therese on <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he encountered much difficulty
in getting her statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to use
much patience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therese took a long time
to answer his questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, she
did not answer; <u>she just laughed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes, she was hostile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
detective said: "<span class="SpellE">Paulit-ulit</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">ginagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">bata</span> <span class="SpellE">para</span>
<span class="SpellE">lang</span> <span class="SpellE">masagot</span>" (<span class="SpellE">sumagot</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
questions had to be explained to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The explanations of the detective and some of the re­marks made by
Therese do not appear in her statement, Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, January 5, Therese was examined by the medico-legal
officer of the Philippine Constabulary crime laboratory at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found her to be "<u>feeble-minded</u>
but coherent".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not easy to
elicit the facts from her be­cause she was hesitant and her recollection was
poor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was assisted by her
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it was Therese herself
who narrated the facts without any leading questions from her mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctor found that Therese was no longer a virgin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her hymen had two deep and healed lacerations
at the five and <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>
positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her vaginal orifice offered
slight resistance to the index finger and the virgin-sized speculum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lacerations were more than a month old.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctor also noted in his report that Therese, who is five
feet and two inches tall and weighed one hundred and two pounds, had conical
breasts "with pinkish-brown areola and nipples from which no secretion
could be pressed out".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1973</st1:date>,
at about eleven-forty in the morning, there was a confrontation in the police
headquarters between Therese and Winston.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She identified Winston as the rapist (50-54 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
<st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Winston admitted that there was such a
confrontation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be stressed
that on that occasion Winston did not make any statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was silent (69-73 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
<st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1974</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1973</st1:date>,
Therese and her mother filed the following complaint for rape against Winston <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> in the Court of First Instance at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 28th and 30th days of November, 1972, in
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Philippines, the above-named accused,
did, then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously by means <u>of force and against her will,</u> have sexual
intercourse with the undersigned complainant, a minor, mentally retarded, <u>with
mental level as that of a five-year old child</u> to her damage and prejudice,
in such amount as may be awarded to her under the provisions of the Civil Code
of the Philippines."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Note that the charge is that <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>
employed force in having sexual intercourse with Therese, a mentally retarded
minor with the mental level of a five-year-old child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court regarded that charge as
proven, meaning that <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> had forcible sexual
intercourse with a feeble-minded girl, a victim, with "mental abnormality
or deficiency of reason".</p>

<p class="BODY">It convicted <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> of simple rape,
sentenced him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and
ordered him to pay Therese <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> damages amounting
to P40,000.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> contends in this appeal (1)
that the lower court's judgment is void, (2) that Therese was not mentally
retarded, (3) that her testimony should not be given credence, and (4) that the
prosecution's evidence is not sufficient to warrant conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the lower court's decision is void cannot be
taken seriously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant argues that
the decision is void because Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> did not hear the case and he rendered the judgment
after the expiration of the ninety-day period from the time when it was
submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
heard by Judge Julian E. <span class="SpellE">Lustre</span> who suffered a stroke
before he could decide it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> did not
conduct the trial and that he was merely detailed to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
did not mean that he could not decide the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His detail carries with it the pre­rogative to decide the cases already
submitted for decision to his predecessor, Judge <span class="SpellE">Lustre</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Buslon</span>,
L-22778, November 29, 1965, 15 SCRA 460.) There is no law which pro­hibits a
judge from deciding a case just because he did not hear the witnesses who
testified therein (Ortiz vs. <span class="SpellE">Aramburo</span>, 8 Phil. 98;
Villanueva vs. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>, L-30050, June 27, 1975, 64
SCRA 407).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the <u>Ortiz</u> case, it was held that where the judge
who heard the evidence resigned without deciding the case, his successor,
having before him the evidence presented to the first judge, could render a
valid judgment on the basis of such evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the circumstance that the decision was
rendered after the ninety-day period fixed in section 5 of the Judiciary Law
does not mean that the decision is void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judge, who does not decide the case within the ninety-day period,
may be subject to disciplinary action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ninety-day period did not apply to Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>
because the case was submitted for decision when Judge <span class="SpellE">Lustre</span>
was still the incumbent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the merits of the case, we are convinced that <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> had sexual intercourse with Therese on the two
occa­sions mentioned by her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That fact
was ascertained from her by the police investigator and by the medico-legal
officer who exa­mined her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
noteworthy that <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> did not deny it at the
confrontation in the police precinct. "He who remains silent when he ought
to speak cannot be heard to speak when he should be silent".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(31 C.J.S. 494.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See sec. 23, Rule 130, Rules of Court on
admission by silence, which was applied in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pilones</span>,
L-32754-5, <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1978</st1:date>.)
Although the testimony of Therese at the trial may be vitiated by
contradictions and inadequacies, due to her low intelligence, she,
nevertheless, stuck steadfastly to her story that she, to use her own words,
had "made baby" or had carnal intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>
in the afternoon of November 28 and 30, 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the circumstance as to whether <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>
employed force in "making baby" with her or in inserting his organ
into her "paddy" was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are indications that Therese did not tenaciously
resist the advances of <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the police inves­tigator,
Therese narrated the alleged rape in this manner (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A):</p>

<blockquote>"13. Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did he make baby with you? - A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Winston invited me to his house because he
said that his sister wants to be friend with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I go with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrive at their house, Winston told
me that his sister is not in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I want to leave the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I am going out of the house, Winston locked the door.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When Winston
locked the door, I fight him and told him I want to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, he hold my hands and lay me down the
floor and then he put his body on top of me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I cannot move any­more and he pulled my panty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he insert his <span class="SpellE">peny</span>
in my paddy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This take him about 15
minutes before he let me go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
gave me a pill, colored red and white and told me to drink the pill for my <span class="SpellE">meanstration</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
giving the pill he accompanied me up to the basketball court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, I went home alone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1972</st1:date>, I went to the
basketball court at the corner of Cal­deron and a small street I do not know
the name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the bas­ketball court,
Winston see me and told me to go to his house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told him I want to go with somebody to his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I go with Robin and Winston.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the house we just talk and then later we
all leave the house and I go home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30 pm</st1:time>, <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="11"><u>November 30, 1972</u></st1:date>, I play basketball at the
basketball court again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, when I was
playing, I saw Winston and he saw me also.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Winston called me and I continue playing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Edgar comes to me and told me that
Winston is calling me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him
why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that Winston will tell me
something and if I will not go, he will get mad of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I go with Winston and he take me to his
house again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When we were at
the garage he closed the door of the garage and then told me 'I want to make
love'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him I do not like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he hold my hands again while I was sitting
on chair and told me to lay down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told
him do not like (sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, pushed me
very hard and I fall on the chair and he put his body again on top of me and
pulled my panty and insert again his penny in to my paddy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It takes us about ten minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he told me to go home alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I go home alone." (pp. 108-109,
Record).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The police investigator admitted that he pieced the above account
from the fragmented narration which he extracted with much trouble from Therese
and which was punctuated by remarks not included in her statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even the above recital does not exclude the hypothesis that
Therese consented to the carnal intercourse although with some show of
reluctance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The initiative came from <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether the complaint and the evidence are
sufficient to convict appellant <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> of rape
committed when the victim was deprived of reason (<span class="SpellE"><u>privada</u></span><u>
de <span class="SpellE">razon</span></u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint does not spell out that <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>
had sexual intercourse with a girl who was "deprived of reason", as
contemplated in paragraph 2 of article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the allegation therein that <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> had sexual intercourse with a mental retardate
implies that the victim was not in full possession of her normal reasoning
faculty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is sufficient to alert the
accused as to the nature of rape imputed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he has no reason to protest that he has
not been charged with having abused a girl who was de­prived of reason.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sexual intercourse with a woman who is deprived of reason or with
a girl who is below twelve years of age is rape because she is incapable of
giving rational consent to the carnal intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Las <span class="SpellE">mujeres</span> <span class="SpellE">privadas</span> de <span class="SpellE">razón</span>, <span class="SpellE">enajenadas</span>, <span class="SpellE">idiotas</span>, imbeciles,

<p class="BODY">The same rule prevails in American jurisprudence. "There can
be no question but that a copulation with a woman known to be mentally
incapable of giving even an imperfect consent is rape" (State vs. Jewett,
192 <span class="SpellE">Atl</span>. 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">"An accused is guilty of the crime of rape when it is
established that he had sexual intercourse with a female who was mentally
incapable of validly consenting to or opposing the carnal act" (65 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2nd 766 citing State vs. <span class="SpellE">Prokosch</span>,
152 Minn. 86, 187 NW 971; <span class="SpellE">Cokeley</span> vs. State, 87 Tex. <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. 256, 220 SW 1099; 31 ALR, 3rd 1227, sec. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">"In this species of rape neither force upon the part of the
man nor resistance upon the part of the woman forms an element of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, by reason of any mental
weakness, she is incapable of legally consenting, resistance is not ex­pected
any more than it is in the case of one who has been drugged to unconsciousness,
or robbed of judgment by intoxicants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor will an apparent consent in such a case avail any more than in the
case of a child who may actually consent, but who by law is conclusively held
incapable of legal consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the
woman possessed mental capacity sufficient to give legal consent must, saving
in exceptional cases, remain a question of fact x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It need but be
said that legal consent presupposes an intelligence capable of understanding
the act, its nature, and possible conse­quences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This degree of intelligence may exist with an
impaired and weakened intellect, or it may not" (People vs. Boggs, 290
Pac. 618 citing People vs. Griffin, 49 Pac. 711 and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Peery</span>, 146 Pac. 44).</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case bears some similarity to State vs. <span class="SpellE">Prokosch</span>, <u>supra</u>, where Frank <span class="SpellE">Prokosch</span>
was charged with having raped a twenty-two-year-old girl, an inmate of the
State School for Feeble-Minded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl
had been committed to that school since she was eleven years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the sexual intercourse took
place, the girl was at her father's home on temporary leave of absence during
the holiday season.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her return to
the school, the attendants discovered that she was pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She later delivered a fully developed child.</p>

<p class="BODY">The girl testified that during her stay in her father's home she
had sexual relations with three men, one of whom was <span class="SpellE">Prokosch</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony was found to be credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court found that she was not an
imbecile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had sufficient
intelligence to comprehend the nature of sexual intercourse but not sufficient
"to require a holding as a matter of law that she understood and
appreciated the moral wrong or the natural consequences to flow <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>She was
classed by an expert psychologist, a witness for the state, as a moron, and to
possess the mentality of a child about the age of eight years." <span class="SpellE">Prokosch</span> was convicted of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Boggs</u> case, <u>supra</u>, a case also similar to
the instant case, the accused had sexual intercourse twice with a
twenty-two-year-old woman of subnormal mentality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She reached high school but, according to one
of her teachers, the victim had the "mentality of a child twelve years old".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A doctor testified that she had no "sufficient
mentality to pro­tect herself from the ordinary vicissitudes of
life".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vic­tim testified and,
"while she showed considerable intelligence in fixing dates and describing
places and events, her under­standing of the nature of sexual intercourse and
its consequences was essentially that of a child".</p>

<p class="BODY">"It is true that she seemed to know what constitutes the
physical act and that pregnancy might result <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
but she apparently had little conception of other serious consequences which
would follow." Another doctor testified that the victim sometimes gave
intelligent answers to questions, "showing, of course, what she had
assimilated by contact with older people, and then again the answers showed the
irrelevancy of a child rather than an adult".</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held that the victim was incapable of giving legal consent
to sexual intercourse because of mental <span class="SpellE">subnormality</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was convicted of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court said that it would be a reproach to
the State to hold that it affords no protection to morons of weak mental
capacity, like the victim, "against the base passions of unprincipled
men".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the victim has the mentality of a
five-year-old child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If sexual
intercourse with a child below twelve years of age is rape, then it should
follow that sexual intercourse with a thirteen-year old girl whose mental
capacity is that of a five-year old child would constitute rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mental deficiency of Therese may be gleaned from her
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that she
resided at "P. Go, Project 4, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was asked to spell
"P. Go", she said that she could not spell it (4 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
<st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1974</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She actually resided at <st1:street><st1:address>10
  Padre Burgos Street</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Asked to explain her testimony that she "was fucking
with" Winston, she replied that fucking means "fighting" and
that when she "made baby" with Winston she was "fighting
with" him (Ibid, 19 and 23 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that Winston placed his penis
"in the couch" (29 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>), that she did not
suffer any physical injury because she "had no voice" (43 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>) and that she did not cry for help but a moment later
she said that she cried for help (44 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">During the second time Therese was under cross-examination, she
testified that she had sexual intercourse with Winston in the market in <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, meaning the <span class="SpellE">Unimart</span> (14 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1974</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not know whether her friend, Robin,
is a teenager (35 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She made contradictory state­ments as to
whether Winston inserted his organ into her pri­vate part (41 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usually, she
answered questions by making statements but when she answered in the
affirmative or in the negative, she just nodded or shook her head as the case
may be (44 and 48 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">During the third time that she was under cross-exami­nation, she
could not understand what making contradictory statements meant (16 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1974</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that she did not know that
sexual intercourse with appellant <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> was wrong:</p>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style=""> </span>Precisely, knowing that . . . , do you know that what Winston did to
you on November 28 was wrong? - A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No,
sir</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>
You did not know that having (sexual) intercourse with Winston was not wrong?
(sic) - A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>I do not know that</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>
Do you know that having (sexual) intercourse with a man may cause pregnancy,
may make you pregnant? - A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No, sir</u>."
(43 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="4">April
 1, 1974</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the circumstances detailed above and the testimonies
of Doctor <span class="SpellE">Hofileña</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Lizaso</span>
as to the mental incapacity of Therese, appellant's contention that Therese is
not mentally retarded cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> testified that he knew Therese
to be a normal person and that she informed him that she was studying at the
"<st1:place><st1:placename>St. Joseph</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied any knowledge that Therese was
mentally retarded (63-65 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1974</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, considering that Therese was not his girl friend, that
he never courted her, and that after knowing her for two or three weeks, he was
able to have sexual congress with her two times, we cannot believe his
pretension that he did not know that Therese was mentally handicapped or was subnormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who conversed with Therese would not
fail to notice that she has some mental deficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constabulary medico-legal officer, who
examined her, concluded that she was "feeble-minded" although he did
not give her any psycho­metric tests.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Boggs</u> case, <u>supra</u>, where a
twenty-two-year-old girl with subnormal mentality was ravished, the court noted
that the accused "must have known of the subnormal mentality of his
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding such knowledge,
he persisted in his lustful purpose until he overcame her weak resistance and
accomplished her ruin." That observation applies to the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, taking advantage of
Therese's mental deficiency and immaturity (she had barely reached the age of
puberty) and subordinating his will to his concu­piscence or animal instincts,
was able to have carnal inter­course twice with a thirteen-year-old girl who
was not aware of the disgrace and dishonorable consequences resulting from that
immoral act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed by the accused is simple rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No Modifying circumstances can be appreciated
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court properly
sentenced him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
[Arts. 63 and 335(2), Revised Penal Code].</p>

<p class="BODY">Before article 335 was amended, simple rape was pena­lized by <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> or twelve years and one day to twenty years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 4111 raised the penalty for
simple rape to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and
made qualified rape a capital offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taking notice of the rampancy of sexual assaults, ensuing from the lawlessness
and deterioration of morals occasioned by the war, the lawmaking body sought to
deter rapists by increasing the penalty for rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a judicious consideration of the facts and circum­stances
of this case, we believe that after appellant <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>
had served a term of imprisonment consistent with the ends of retributive
justice, executive clemency may be extended to him in the discretion of the
Chief Executive and Prime Minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
copy of this decision should be furnished the Minister of Justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's judgment is affirmed subject to the observation
in the preceding paragraph as to the application to this case of article 5 of
the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against
the appellant.</p>

<span class="SpellE">Ladeca</span>, CA-G. R. No. 3835-R, June 30, 1950, the Court
of Appeals cites the opinion of the Spanish com­mentator, <span class="SpellE">Groizard</span>,
5 <span class="SpellE">Codigo</span> Penal de 1870, 105-107,that in "rape
committed when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, it is
the lack of will in the victim that determines the existence of the crime, and
this lack of will is present, not only when the victim is unconscious or
totally deprived of reason, but also where the woman is suffering from <u>mental
deficiency</u> to the extent that she is deprived of reason or free will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, it is not necessary that the
woman offer real or constant resistance to the consummation of the crimi­nal
act.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"It is a settled proposition,
both in civil law as well as in common law jurisdiction, that carnal knowledge
of a woman, who is weak in intellect to the extent that she is in­capable of
legally consenting, constitutes the crime of rape; and that in this type of
rape the employment of force or inti­midation on the part of the man and
resistance on the part of the woman is not essential.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"It being an established fact
that the offended party was feeble-minded, sickly, weak in mind and intellect,
almost an idiot, she was deprived of reason when the accused had carnal
knowledge of her within the meaning of article 335, Case No. 2 of the Revised
Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that she did not
offer any resistance did not mean that she consented, for she was inca­pable of
giving rational consent." (18 <span class="SpellE">Velayo's</span> Digest,
931-2).</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"The deprivation of reason
contemplated by law does not need to be complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mental abnormality or deficiency is
enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, it was held by the Supreme
Court of Spain that a man having carnal knowledge of a woman whose mental facul­ties
are not normally developed or who is suffering from <span class="SpellE">hemi­plegia</span>
and mentally backward or who is an idiot commits the crime of rape"
(Sentences of November 19, 1930, May 11, 1932 and June 24, 1935 cited in People
<i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Daing</span>, CA 49 O. G. 2331, 2338).</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Daing</u></span>
case, the sixty-five-year-old accused was convicted of rape of a
fourteen-year-old feeble-minded girl who communicated her ideas and feelings in
monosyllables, punc­tuated here and there by gestures and signs of her hands as
well as by her facial expressions, especially through the medium of her
lips.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was considered as rape of
a girl deprived of reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
allowed to testify in court.</p>
