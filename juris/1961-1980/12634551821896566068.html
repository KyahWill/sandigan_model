de Ignacio in these special civil actions of <i>certiorari, mandamus </i>and
prohibition seeks to annul the order of the Court of First Instance of <span
class=SpellE>Camarines</span> <span class=SpellE>Sur</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Naga</span> City Branch I, setting aside the decision of the City
Court of <span class=SpellE>Naga</span> in Civil Case No. 3092 (an <span
class=SpellE>ejectment</span> suit) and allowing <span class=SpellE>Sixto</span>
Tan to present his evidence in conformity with his answer (Civil Case No.
7580).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The facts are as follows:</p>

<p class=BODY>On October 1, 1955 Mrs. Ignacio, in her personal capacity and as <span
class=SpellE>administratrix</span> of the estate of her deceased husband Jose
Ignacio, leased to <span class=SpellE>Sixto</span> Tan “for a period of fifteen
(15) years” a portion of Lot No. 1367 located in <span class=SpellE>Naga</span>
City.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The said lot, evidently a conjugal
lot, has an area of five hundred ninety-five square meters.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The portion leased to Tan has an area of one
hundred eighty-one square meters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has
a frontage of twenty-six meters on <st1:Street><st1:address>Elias Angeles
  Street</st1:address></st1:Street>.</p>

<p class=BODY>It was stipulated in the lease contract that Tan was to construct
a one-story building on the leased lot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After the expiration of two years from the time the building was ready
for occupancy, it would automatically become the <span class=SpellE>lessors</span>'
property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tan would then pay a monthly
rental of P300 for the lease of the building.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>During the two-year period he would not pay any rental.</p>

<p class=BODY>The lease contract has the peculiarity that while it is
stipulated therein that the term thereof is fifteen years (par. 2), without
specifying when that period would commence, the contract also contains
provisions stating that the lease is for twenty-five years (pars. 3, 7 and 8).</p>

<p class=BODY>The explanation for such dichotomy in the term of the lease is
that after the expiration of the fifteen-year period the lease would continue,
at a monthly rental of P150, with respect to “the last two doors of” the
building near the corner of Angeles and Evangelista Streets.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two doors would “serve as rights of way”
to Tan's other build­ing constructed on the adjacent lot belonging to the heirs
of Mariano <span class=SpellE>Abella</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The easement of right of way as well as the easement of light and view
would exist for twenty-five years (pars. 7 and 8).</p>

<p class=BODY>It was further stipulated in the lease contract that in case of
the destruction of the building constructed by Tan, he would have the option to
construct another building under the same terms and conditions for the
remaining period of the lease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should he
not exercise that option, then the lease would be deemed rescinded except with
res­pect to the right of way and Tan's right to open windows in the third story
of his other building, which rights would endure up to the end of the
twenty-five year period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For reference,
the contract is quoted below:</p>

<p class=BODY>A cursory perusal of the contract shows that it is vi­tiated by
some ambiguities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The date when the
fifteen-year period would commence is not crystal clear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That ambi­guity affects the twenty-five year
period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The provision that in the event
the building is destroyed, the lessee may cons­truct another building under the
same terms and conditions “as in this contract” is not clear as to whether the
lessee would not pay rentals within the two-year period counted from the date
when the new building is ready for occupancy.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is evident that during the first two years of the fif­teen
years the, lease is a gratuitous lease of the lot (as in <span class=SpellE>commodatum</span>)
and that during the thirteen-year period the lease refers to the building which
by then had become <i>ipso facto </i>the <span class=SpellE>lessors</span>’
property. Thereafter, or during the ten-year period the lease is limited to the
last two doors or to the <span class=SpellE>lessors</span>' obligation to
recognize the easements of right of way and light and view in favor of Tan’s
building on the adjacent lot.</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan constructed the building.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was finished “some­time in 1956” (pp. 58 and 68, <span class=SpellE><i>Rollo</i></span><i>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></i>However, on Novem­ber 7 or 8, 1968 it was
completely burned. On November 23 Tan informed Mrs. Ignacio that he was going
to recons­truct the building.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They could
not agree on the conditions under which the building was to be
reconstructed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Ignacio insisted
that Tan should construct the building as stipulated in the 1955 lease
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tan proposed, that Mrs.
Ignacio should shoulder the cost of reconstruction in excess of P6,000, the
amount fixed in the lease contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs.
Ignacio rejected that proposal.</p>

<p class=BODY>As Tan persisted in his determination to reconstruct the building
at a cost of about P14,000 to P15,000, Mrs. Ignacio filed in the lower court an
injunction action to res­train Tan from reconstructing the building.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Executive Judge <span class=SpellE>Ulpiano</span>
<span class=SpellE>Sarmiento</span> issued a restraining order.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case was assigned to Judge <span
class=SpellE>Delfin</span> <span class=SpellE>Vir</span>. <span class=SpellE>Suñga</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On <st1:date Year="1970" Day="21" Month="1">January
 21, 1970</st1:date> he issued an order dissolving the restraining order and
denying the petition for injunction (Civil Case No. 6868).</p>

<p class=BODY>Mrs. Ignacio assailed Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga's</span>
order by <i>certiorari </i>in the Court of Appeals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That Court on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="11"
Month="2">February 11, 1970</st1:date> issued a writ of preliminary injunction
enjoining Tan from reconstructing the building.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Court of Appeals in its decision held that because Tan's
lease expired on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>,
he had no more right to stay in the leased premises and he had virtually become
a squatter therein. Consequently, the injunction suit and the <i>certiorari</i>
<i>case had become moot and acade­mic.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The Court of Appeals
dismissed the petition without prejudice to Mrs. Ignacio's right to eject Tan
should he refuse to vacate the leased premises.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court found Tan in contempt of court for continuing with the
reconstruc­tion of the building in defiance of the injunction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It fined him five hundred pesos (<span
class=SpellE>Vda</span>. de Ignacio <i>vs. </i>Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga</span>,
CA-G.R. No. 44657-R, October 28, 1970).</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan in his motion for reconsideration assailed the Court's
finding that the lease had already expired.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He con­tended that the fifteen-year term of the lease did not commence
on October 1, 1955 when the contract was exe­cuted; that it was stipulated that
the rentals would be paid after the expiration of two years from the date the
building was ready for occupancy; that even after the expiration of the
fifteen-year period, Tan could still occupy for ten years the last two doors,
and that, in case of reconstruction of the building, he could occupy it for two
years without paying any rental, as stipulated in the lease contract.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Court of Appeals denied Tan's motion for reconsi­deration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It noted that its conclusion on the
expiration of the lease was based on the contract itself which formed part of
the record.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the same time the Court
observed that Tan’s contentions regarding the term of the lease raised factual
issues which could not be resolved at that stage of the case and which should
be interposed as de­fenses in the trial court in the proper case at the proper
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That ambivalent observation
spawned this controversy between Tan and Mrs. Ignacio.</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan filed in this Court a petition for <i>certiorari, </i>praying
for the reversal of the holding of the Court of Appeals that the lease had
already expired and that he had committed contempt of court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This Court in a minute reso­lution denied the
petition for lack of merit and because it involved factual matters (Tan <i>vs. </i><span
class=SpellE>Vda</span>. de Ignacio, L-33170, February 18, 1971).</p>

<p class=BODY>On <st1:date Year="1970" Day="20" Month="11">November 20, 1970</st1:date>
Mrs. Ignacio filed in the City Court of <span class=SpellE>Naga</span> an
unlawful <span class=SpellE>detainer</span> action against Tan and his <span
class=SpellE>sublessee</span> on the basis of the Court of Appeals’ finding
that Tan’s lease expired on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1,
 1970</st1:date>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She alleged that the
reasonable compensation for the use and occupa­tion of the premises occupied by
Tan was two thousand five hundred pesos a month.</p>

<p class=BODY>She further alleged that the building reconstructed by Tan was
destroyed on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="13" Month="10">October 13, 1970</st1:date>
by the typhoon <span class=SpellE><i>Sening</i></span><i> </i>and that the
Court of Appeals denied Tan’s motion for the repair of the building (Civil Case
No. 3092).</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan in his answer merely interposed the negative de­fense that
his lease had not yet expired.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
averred that the typhoon only partially destroyed the reconstructed building.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the City Court the parties entered into a stipulation of facts
which included the lease contract, the injunction complaint in Civil Case No.
6868, the restraining order, Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga's</span> order
denying the injunction, the record of the aforementioned <i>certiorari case </i>in

affidavit wherein it was stated that the sublease would take effect on <st1:date
Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date> when the lease
contract between Tan and Mrs. Ignacio would expire.</p>

<p class=BODY>On <st1:date Year="1973" Day="26" Month="3">March 26, 1973</st1:date>
the City Court issued a ruling dis­allowing cross-examination questions to Mrs.
Ignacio which would revive the issue as to the expiration of the lease.</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan moved for the reconsideration of that ruling. The City Court
denied his motion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It assumed that this
Court in its minute resolution dismissing Tan’s appeal had affirmed the finding
of the Court of Appeals that the lease expired on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="1"
Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The City Court said that it had “no legal authority to set aside” this
Court's resolution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It cited the ruling
that a final judgment of this Court “is binding on all inferior courts, and hence
beyond their power and authority to alter or modify” (<span class=SpellE>Macansantos</span>
<i>vs. </i><span class=SpellE>Fernan</span>, 112 Phil. 1100).</p>

<p class=BODY>In view of the City Court's refusal to entertain evi­dence on the
expiration of the lease, Tan did not present any evidence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On <st1:date Year="1973" Day="31" Month="7">July
 31, 1973</st1:date> the City Court rendered a decision ejecting Tan and his <span
class=SpellE>sublessee</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
adhered to the Appellate Court's finding that the lease expired on <st1:date
Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It ordered the defendants to pay <span
class=SpellE>solidarily</span> to Mrs. Ignacio a monthly rental of five hundred
pesos beginning October, 1970.</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan appealed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case was
assigned to Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga</span> (Civil Case No. 7580), the
same Judge who in 1970 denied Mrs. Ignacio's petition to enjoin Tan from
reconstructing the building.</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan filed a memorandum praying that the City Court's decision be
set aside and that the case be remanded to the inferior court for the reception
of his evidence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Ignacio in her
memorandum prayed that the City Court's decision be affirmed.</p>

<p class=BODY>Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga</span> in his order of <st1:date
Year="1975" Day="30" Month="4">April 30, 1975</st1:date> disregarded the
finding of the Court of Appeals that Tan’s lease expired on <st1:date
Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga</span> said:</p>

<blockquote>“With due respect to the better opinion of the Court of Appeals and
the Supreme Court, this Court finds no ground for the said Courts to rule on
the expiration of the contract of lease (<span class=SpellE>Exh</span>. A) as
the same was not in issue. ***.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What was
in issue raised by the pleadings and/or pra­yers of the appellant was an
injunction to prevent the <span class=SpellE>appellee</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sixto</span> Tan and his agent from conti­nuing the reconstruction
of a new commercial building as provided for in par. 10 (<span class=SpellE>Exh</span>.
A-7) of the lease contract between them”.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga</span>, disagreeing with the Court
of Appeals, ruled that the lease had not yet expired.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He ordered the remand of the <span
class=SpellE>ejectment</span> case to the City Court for the re­ception of
Tan's evidence “pursuant to his answer to the complaint and rebut whatever
evidence that the plaintiff has presented”.</p>

<p class=BODY>Mrs. Ignacio moved for the reconsideration of Judge <span
class=SpellE>Suñga's</span> order.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
cited the elementary rule that an infe­rior court has no legal authority to set
aside a final and <span class=SpellE>executory</span> judgment of this Court
and grant new trial (<span class=SpellE>Usaffe</span> Veterans Association,
Inc. <i>vs</i>. Treasurer of the Philippines, L-18393, December 17, 1966, 18
SCRA 1091).</p>

<p class=BODY>Judge <span class=SpellE>Suñga</span> denied Mrs. Ignacio’s
motion for reconsi­deration in his order of <st1:date Year="1975" Day="7"
Month="7">July 7, 1975</st1:date>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He in
effect held that the Court of Appeals could not rule on the expiration of the
lease because that matter was allegedly not in issue; that its finding on that
point was an <i>obiter dictum, </i>and that the question as to the expiration
of the lease could still be litigated in the <span class=SpellE>ejectment</span>
case.</p>

<p class=BODY>On <st1:date Year="1975" Day="1" Month="9">September 1, 1975</st1:date>
Mrs. Ignacio filed in this Court the aforementioned special civil actions of <i>certiorari,
mandamus </i>and prohibition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
contends that respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion in not accepting
the finding of the Court of Appeals that the lease expired on <st1:date
Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class=BODY>The issue is whether that finding is binding on the City Court
and Court of First Instance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It should
be clari­fied that this Court did not affirm that finding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This Court merely refused to review the
decision of the Court of Appeals presumably because Tan’s appeal was not
warranted under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class=BODY>We hold that that finding, which is found in the body of the
decision of the Court of Appeals as well as in the <span class=SpellE>dispositive</span>

<p class=BODY>That finding is the <i>ratio <span class=SpellE>decidendi</span> </i>of
the decision of the Court of Appeals which held that the injunction action had
become moot and academic, that Tan was a squatter and that Mrs. Ignacio could
judicially eject him if he did not vacate the leased premises <span
class=SpellE>extrajudicially</span>.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Court of Appeals in its resolution of Tan’s motion for
reconsideration said that his contention that the term of the lease had not yet
expired could be raised by him as a defense in the <span class=SpellE>ejectment</span>
suit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That dictum did not impair the
binding force of its conclusive finding that the lease had expired.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It averred that the said finding was
supported by the record.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By denying
Tan's motion for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals in effect reiterated its
decision that the injunction action had become moot because of the ex­piration
of the lease on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan’s contention that the oft-mentioned conclusion of the Court
of Appeals on the expiration of the lease was merely tentative is belied by the
tenor of its decision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Be­cause of the
expiration of the lease, the Court of Appeals held that Tan could be ejected
from the leased premises; that there was no need for an injunction against him,
and that he had no more right to reconstruct the burned building.</p>

<p class=BODY>Tan further contends that if the lease had already ex­pired, then
an <span class=SpellE>ejectment</span> suit was not necessary for then there
would be nothing more to decide.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
contention is untenable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An <span
class=SpellE>ejectment</span> suit was required because if Tan persisted in
remaining in the leased premises, Mrs. Ignacio could not forcibly oust him <span
class=SpellE>therefrom</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She would
have no choice but to go to court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Court of Appeals could not decree in the <i>certiorari</i> case that Tan should
be ejected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moreover, the reasonable
compensation for the use and occupation of the lot should be ascertained in the
<span class=SpellE>eject­ment</span> suit.</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in not
giving effect to the ruling of the Court of Appeals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He could express his honest conviction that
it was an erro­neous ruling but he could not refuse to give it effect (People <i>vs.
</i><st1:City><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:City>, 104 Phil. 551, 560;
People <i>vs.</i> Vera, 65 Phil. 56, 82; <span class=SpellE>Shioji</span> <i>vs.
</i>Harvey, 43 Phil. 333, 337).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By not
applying that ruling, he virtually nullified the decision of the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class=BODY>The lower court erred in remanding the <span class=SpellE>ejectment</span>
suit to the City Court for the purpose of receiving Tan's evi­dence in support
of his defense that the lease had not yet expired.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lease contract is the best evidence on
the expi­ration of the lease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its
provisions reveal that during the two-year period from the date when the
building was ready for occupancy (sometime in 1956 according to Mrs. Ignacio),
no rentals were due because, obviously, the building, which would become the <span
class=SpellE>lessors</span>' property, served as the compensation for Tan's use
of the lot.</p>

<p class=BODY>During the remaining thirteen years, the subject matter of the
lease was the building for which a monthly rental of three hundred pesos was
due.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon the expiration of the
fifteen-year period (which could have been in 1971 but which the Court of
Appeals in its final judgment found to be October 1, 1970), the lease would
continue for another ten years (up to September 30, 1980) but only with res­pect
to the easements of right of way and light and view for which a monthly rental
of one hundred fifty pesos would be paid by Tan to Mrs. Ignacio.</p>

<p class=BODY>The lower court should decide Tan’s appeal on the assumption that
the lease expired on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>
since, as already stated, that finding is <span class=SpellE><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class=SpellE>judicata</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></i>It
should find out whether the evidence presented by Mrs. Ignacio in the City
Court is sufficient to sustain the inferior court's finding that the reasonable
compensation for the use and occupation of the one hundred eighty-one square
meters originally leased by Tan is five hundred pesos a month, and that Tan
should pay P2,000 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Judge's orders of April 30, and <st1:date
Year="1975" Day="7" Month="7">July 7, 1975</st1:date> are set aside.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lower court is directed to conduct
further proceedings along the guidelines herein stated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It should decide the <span class=SpellE>ejectment</span>
suit by using as a basis the finding of the Court of Appeals that the lease
expired on <st1:date Year="1970" Day="1" Month="10">October 1, 1970</st1:date>
and that Tan is a squatter on the leased premises.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No costs.</p>
