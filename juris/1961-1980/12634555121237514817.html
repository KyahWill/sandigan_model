<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> return to the present
petition concedes that the board of canvassers of December 27 <span style="">which </span>proclaimed
<span class="SpellE">Negre</span> Mayor-elect was wholly composed of LP <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span>, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Saludares</span> (vice <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>); (2) Manuel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> (vice

and avers that late in the afternoon of December 29, respondent <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> submitted his oath of office which was subscribed and
sworn to on December 28.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of the private respondents, in turn, questions once
again the validity of the composition of the board of canvassers which
proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> <span style="">as </span>Mayor-elect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached thereto is an affidavit of Federico
Q. <span class="SpellE">Galapia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
Registrar, dated November 28, which, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
states that in the morning of November <u>18</u>, <span class="SpellE">reelectionist</span>
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, with several heavily armed companions,
entered his (<span class="SpellE">Galapia's</span>) house and over his protest
demanded that he <span style="">sign </span>the designation of the six members of the board of
canvassers; that he <span style="">was </span>so afraid, because he knew that Vice Mayor Franco was killed
and Capt. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> <span style="">was </span>seriously wounded, that he acceded to
the Mayor's demands; and that realizing that he had done wrong, he fled to
Manila on the same day to save his life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said private respondents aver that the so-called "protest"
which <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> filed in court was primarily to annul the
constitution of, and the illegal canvass and proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> made by, the board of canvassers; and that such
petition was made <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>cautelam</u></span> to meet
the deadline, if the petition with <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should
fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They state that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Negre</span></span><span style=""> was </span>proclaimed Mayor-elect on
December 28, took his oath on the same day, and assumed office as Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ask for judgment dismissing the petition
and dissolving the restraining orders.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>' reply to private respondents'
answer attributes to <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> and his armed goons the
killing on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1968</st1:date>
of one Dante <span class="SpellE">Calon</span>, a nephew of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his supplemental petition filed herein, <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
included <span style="">as </span><span style="">re­spondent </span>the second board of
canvassers which proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> on December
28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He avers that this board was created
without notice to all parties; that all the members thereof were LPs whose
names were submitted by respondent <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Ramiro,
local LP chairman, to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> representative <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>, on December 27; that
in <span style="">the </span>canvass made on December
27 by the second board, the returns in Precincts 18, 19, 21 and 22 were
arbitrarily excluded <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>; and that all
proceedings in connection with this canvass are null <span style="">and </span>void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner,
accordingly, prays that <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> be restrained <span style="">permanently from assuming office or
performing the powers and duties of Mayor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In answer to the
supplemental petition, private respondents </span>stress <span style="">the fact that the present <span class="GramE">case
<span style="">as </span>well
<span style="">as </span>the
restraining orders are</span> moot and academic, for <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>
had taken his oath and assumed and performed the functions of Mayor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">now before us for decision en the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issues tendered will be resolved <u>seriatim</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A question of first
impression we are called upon to decide this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where a municipal councilor elected in the 1963 elections runs for Vice
Mayor in the elections of 1967, and the Provincial Governor appointed in his
place as such councilor another, may the latter be substituted as member of the
municipal board of canvassers for the 1967 elections?</p>

<p class="BODY">This problem cropped up because Jose <span class="SpellE">Cack</span>,
NP, <span style="">was named </span>in place of <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Malto</span> who was a councilor
elected in 1963 <span style="">as an </span>LP, and
who ran for Vice Mayor <span style="">as </span>such
in the 1967 elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondents argue that Jose <span class="SpellE">Cack</span> should not sit in
the board of can­vassers and should be substituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their reason <span style="">is </span>that <span class="SpellE">Cack's</span> appointment violates
the provisions of Section 8 of Republic Act 5185 - effective September 12, 1967
- which requires that the provincial governor appoint<span style=""> </span>as substitute a "qualified person belonging to the
political party or faction of the officer whom he <span style="">is </span>to replace upon recommendation of the said political party or
faction and who shall serve the unexpired term of office."</p>

<p class="BODY">The ratiocination thus advocated does not advance private re­spondents'
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>First</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because such appointment
cannot be attacked in a collateral proceeding.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not to inquire here into the reasons
or motivations which led to <span class="SpellE">Cack's</span> appointment as
substitute councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can, at best,
make surmises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>not the function of this Court to
strip <span class="SpellE">Cack</span> of his rights and prerogatives as
substitute councilor without giving him opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A healthy respect for due process will
prevent us from nullifying his appointment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 167 of the
Revised Election Code empowers <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to replace
with "registered voters of the same party," members of the municipal
council who are candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cack</span> <span style="">was </span>not
a candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the <span style="">time </span>of canvass, be was <span style="">a </span>member of the municipal
council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His replace­ment cannot be
authorized by law.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was the proclamation of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
by the Board of canvassers on November 18, confirmed by resolution of the same
board on November 23, valid and binding?<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to the substitute members of the board which
proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> Mayor-elect, certain facts are
beyond debate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their number is six:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Rafael <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>;
(2) Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Dungan</span>; (3) Jose <span class="SpellE">Cack</span>;
(4) Benito <span class="SpellE">Agdeppa</span>; (5) Segundo <span class="SpellE">Acdal</span>;
and (6) <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Battung</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were all NP <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The LP had no representation in that
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing of record will prove that
the LP <span style="">was </span>asked
to recommend their substitutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet,
three of the councilors to be substituted, namely, Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Ilac</span>,
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Casil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macugay</span>, were LPs when they ran for office in 1963, <span style="">as </span>well <span style="">as in </span>1967
when they presented their certificates of candidacy for reelection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their substitutes must necessarily be drawn
from voters of the LP in compliance with <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
Section 167.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score alone, the
board of canvassers, composed of six substitute members heretofore mentioned, <span style="">was </span>illegally
constituted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor was notice of the November 18 canvass or of the board's
meeting of November 23 ever sent to Councilor <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
Meta, LP, who did not run for reelection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Naturally, he took no part in either.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether an LP or NP, Mata must be notified of the canvassing and
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">was, </span>by law, entitled to sit in the
board of can­vassers.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
We have recently held in <st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Campos</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>,
L-28439 (Resolution), <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="12">December 29,
 1967</st1:date>, that where a member of the board of canvassers designated by
law is <u><span style="">excluded</span></u><span style=""> </span>from the canvass by reason of which
he did not take part therein, the canvass and resulting proclamation are both
null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, hold that the canvass and the proclamation of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
are both null and void.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if the November
proclamation of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> as Mayor-elect <span style="">is
</span>null and void, the December proclamation of his opponent, <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>, fares no better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter <span style="">is as null </span>and void as the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nine members of the board, which pro­claimed
<span class="SpellE">Negre</span>, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Saludares</span>;
(2) Carlos <span class="SpellE">Descalso</span>; (3) <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Ramiro, Sr.; (4) Richard <span class="SpellE">Eclarin</span>; (5) Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Dadufalza</span>; (6) Manuel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>; (7)
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Bagasol</span>; (8) Edwin <span class="SpellE">Lacuanan</span>;
and (9) <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Descalso</span>,
were all appointed by <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> representative <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Bello</span> on December 27, on
proposal made by respondent <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Ramiro, local LP
chairman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, obviously because
both <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and respondents were of the belief that
since in the 1963 elections all of the elected municipal officials of Sanchez
Mira were LPs, the LP was entitled to propose the appointment of all the substitute
of those who ran as candidates in the 1967 elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must have to state that the appointments of these members of
the board run smack against the doctrine laid down in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ibuna</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <u><span style="">Commission</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>on</u> <u><span style="">Elections</span></u><span style="">, </span>L-28328,
December 29, 1967, where this Court (three members expressing a different view)
ruled that what should govern in the appointment of a substitute <span style="">is </span>the
party status of the substituted elected official as of the time of his dis­qualification
to act <span style="">as </span>member
of the board of canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacris</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cac</span> and Presidio <span class="SpellE">Raralio</span>, who
sought reelection in 1967 as NPs, should be replaced with registered voters of
the same party - NP.</p>

<p class="BODY">The composition of this board suffers from another defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Councilor <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
Mata, appointed Councilor Segundo <span class="SpellE">Acdal</span>, and
appointed Councilor Jose <span class="SpellE">Cack</span> did not take part in
that canvass and proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record does not yield <span style="">any excuse </span>for their replace­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stock should be taken of the fact that this
last canvass was <span class="GramE">effected</span> in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
very far from Sanchez Mira.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appropriate
notice should have been given these three.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yet, they were not notified of said canvass and proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
rushed the appointment of an all-LP board on December 27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Canvassing promptly started at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30 a.m.</st1:time>, and terminated at about <st1:time minute="12" hour="15">3:12 p.m.</st1:time> on that day, December 27.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as in the November proclamation, haste characterized the
December proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the
canvass, the board was notified, formally and in open session, by counsel for <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> that the present petition has been lodged with this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pleaded with <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and the board for time to enable this Court to act
on his prayer for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> denied this motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proclamation, it was said, was made at <st1:time minute="15" hour="17">5:15 p.m.</st1:time> and barely five minutes afterwards
this Court's restraining order reached <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The December proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> is
open to attack from another direction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The board of canvassers did not include in the canvass the returns from
Precincts 18, 19, 21 and 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It</u> <u>is</u>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in <span class="SpellE"><u>Espino</u></span> <u><span style="">vs</span></u><span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Zaldivar</u></span>, L-22325, December 11, 1967, citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span> <u>Party</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u>
<u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, 85 Phil. 149, 158, we declared that the canvassing
board will not be compelled to canvass returns which are obviously
manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This does not mean however
that the board and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, when faced with this
situation, should right away disregard the votes cast in precincts where
returns were doctored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are four
copies of official returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allegedly
both the municipal treasurer's and <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> copies
were tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it <span style="">was the </span>duty
of the board to report the matter to <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> could then
hew to the line drawn in <st1:city><st1:place><u>Canton</u></st1:place></st1:city>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>, 1967B <span class="SpellE">Phild</span>. 248, 255, where this Court declared that, in case
the election returns were tampered, "it <span style="">is </span>certainly within the power of the
Commission on Elections to issue such order as would ascertain the existence of
the genuine, authentic <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> election returns.” <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
could acquire into the copies of the returns for the provincial treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if these copies are not authentic, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should look into the copies of the returns in the
ballot boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These should have been
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>First</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because exclusion from canvass returns
decisive of an election is </span><span style="">an
act </span><span style="">which lends itself to misuse

plausible theory which discourage if not eliminate, minimize if not curb,
unlawful proclamation of, and assumption of public trust by, the wrong
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clean elections control the
appropriateness of the remedy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Every effort then should be strained to ascertain the existence of
serviceable returns from Precincts 18, 19, 21 and 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that this cannot be done here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is evidence of record in the form of

more than justifies resort to the copies of the election returns in the hand of
the provincial treasurer and, if necessary, those in the ballot boxes.</p>

<p class="BODY">As is its practice, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should summon

<span style="">L-22248, January 30, 1967, which still
holds true, is that the broad sweep of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> duty
to administer and enforce the election law gives it ample authority to direct
the board of canvassers to include in the canvass returns from the said </span>precincts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it turned out to be, the December 28 proclamation of re­spondent
<span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> as
Mayor-elect is a realistic portrayal of hurry-before-injunction pattern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is null and void.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another problem we are to
grapple with <span style="">is </span>this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">is
</span>the effect of <span class="SpellE">Negre's</span> filing of Case 56-S in
the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> court upon the <st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1967</st1:date> proclamation, confirmed on <st1:date year="1967" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1967</st1:date>, declaring <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> Mayor-elect?</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's submission runs thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Negre</span> filed in the
Court of First Instance an "election protest" (November 29) <u>after</u>
he petitioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to suspend or annul the canvass
of votes and/or to annul the election returns (November 19); the Court of First
Instance acquired exclusive jurisdiction; and <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> <span style="">is </span>deemed to have abandoned his
remedy in <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Just exactly what is the nature of the petition filed by <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> before the CFI in Case 56-S?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, he alleged the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the board of canvassers which proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, consisting of only six members, was illegally
constituted; (2) the said board illegally con­vened, canvassed and proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> Mayor-elect; (3) the election returns from Precincts
18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 were <span style="">falsified
</span>and tampered with by <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, and to consummate
this <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> caused the death of Vice Mayor Manuel
Franco and grave physical injuries to Capt. <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And here is
what <span class="SpellE">Negre's</span> "protest" <span style="">is </span>all about, quoting from the
petition he filed in the CFI (Case 56-S):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He "impugns and <u><span style="">protests</span></u><span style="">" - </span>not necessarily the election
of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> - but "<u>the</u> <u>election</u> <u>returns</u>
and <u>ballots</u> cast in Precincts Nos. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24, <span style="">as </span>well as the <u>proc</u><u><span style="">lamation</span></u><span style="">" </span>of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thus prayed that (1) <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
be <u>enjoined</u> from assuming office; (2) the canvass be annulled and a new
board of canvassers be appointed; (3) the returns from those six precincts be
excluded; and (4) thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> be declared to have
obtained the highest number <span style="">of </span>votes
for the office of Mayor in the uncontested precincts and <u><span style="">proclaimed</span></u><span style=""> </span>Mayor-elect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>These</u>
<u>are</u> <u>but</u> <u><span style="">repetitions</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u>what</u> <u><span style="">respondent</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>seeks</u> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Comelec</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>in</u> <u>his</u> <u><span style="">petition</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="11"><u>November</u><i>
 </i><u>19</u>, <u>1967</u></st1:date> <u>as </u><u><span style="">supplemented</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>on</u>
<st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="12"><u><span style="">December</span></u><span style=""> <u>8</u></span><span style="">, </span><u>1967</u></st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that <span class="SpellE">Negre's</span> petitions
both in <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and in the Court of First Instance
are directed simply at the illegality of the canvass and proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>; the <span style="">desire</span>
to have a new board of <span style="">canvassers; </span>the
exclusion from the canvass of the alleged tampered returns from the precincts
disputed by him; and, thereafter his (<span class="SpellE">Negre's</span>) <u>proclamation</u>
<span style="">as </span>Mayor elect of Sanchez <span style="">Mira.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This i</span>s not a case where there was a <u>valid</u> canvass and
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite apparent that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Negre</span></span><span style="">, within the limited time, </span>between
the date of elections and the date of assumption of office of elected municipal
officials under the law, had to shuttle from the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to the court in an effort to assure himself of ample protection of his
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in a quandary. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Because, nothing in the Revised Election Code
would give him a chance to contest the wrongful proclamation beyond the
two-week period set forth in Section 174.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He could not afford to wait.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
that two-week period was nearing its end, he thought of going to court in the
hope that all will not be <span style="">lost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not that respondent <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> is alone in
this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Petitioner</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span></span> <u>himself</u> concedes that the remedy
pursued by <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
should <u><span style="">proceed</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>to</u> <u>its</u> <u><span style="">logical</span></u><span style=""> <u>conclusion</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
fact, in the answer of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> to the petition in Case
56-S before the Court of First Instance, he emphatically defended himself by
advancing the claim that there is pending before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
<u>another</u> <u>action</u> <u>between</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u><span style="">parties</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>and</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>cause</u>; and
that the CFI petition stated <u>no</u> <u>valid</u> <u>cause</u> <u>of</u> <u>action</u>
and was <u><span style="">premature</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This
lends stout support to the conclusive that the petition before the court was
not an election protest at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the premise that <span class="SpellE">Negre's</span> petition
in Case 56-S <span style="">is </span>not in the
nature of an election protest and that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> was
with juris­diction<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to hear and determine the petition of <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>, the
result is that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> properly annulled the
proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">Just </span>as we make the foregoing pronouncements, we are not unaware
of the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acain</u></span> <u><span style="">vs</span></u><span style="">. </span><u>Board</u> <u>of</u> <u><span style="">Canvassers</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u>

<st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1960</st1:date>, where this
Court, through then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon the filing of the aforementioned petition for a writ of
quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and election protest on December 17 and
28, 1959, respectively, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
acquired exclusive authority to inquire into and <span style="">pass </span>upon the title of <span class="SpellE">Degamo</span> and the
validity of the proclamation made by the municipal <span style="">board of canvassers on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="12"><span style="">December 7, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
cannot, upon the authority of the petition herein, filed January 4, 1960,
determine said questions without encroaching upon the jurisdiction of said
court of first instance, which it is the duty of this body, as the highest
Court of the land, not only to respect, but, also, to uphold.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Acain</u></span> doctrine is not to be
understood as governing the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Acain</u></span>, there was an actual protest;
here, what was desired <span style="">in court by <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> was merely a valid proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, to secure annulment of the canvass
and <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>' proclamation, the first board of
canvassers </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">also made party
respondent in Case 56-S before the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Normally, the board is not a <u>party</u> in</span>
<span style="">interest in an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike in <span class="SpellE"><u>Acain</u></span>
where petitioners did not pursue their remedy (recount), here, <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> persisted in pursuing his petition for annulment of
the wrongful proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Acain</u></span>, private re­spondents assumed office, became
at least <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> officers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, both petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> aver that they assumed office </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> cannot be the remedy for
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Acain</u></span>,
this Court found that the board of canvassers </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">lawfully constituted; here, </span><span style="">we </span><span style="">find that the board of canvassers which proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
was unlawfully constituted, and that, consequently, the canvass and
proclamation made in violation of law are <u>null</u> <u>and</u> <u>void</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To be accentuated now is that the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, as well <span style="">as </span>the subsequent proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Negre</span>, ate both null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case stands <span style="">as if </span>no proclamation has ever been
made at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Negre</span> return to <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> <u>ante</u>
- neither is proclaimed.</p>
