<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
March </span>26, 1965 Serrano sold to the Silver Liners, Inc. (hereinafter
referred to as the SLI) the line <span style="">he was
</span>authorized to operate by virtue of the certificate of public convenience
issued in PSC case 83104, and authorized the latter to file with the PSC the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="4">April <span style="">5, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> Commissioner Medina </span>issued an order

the franchise or certificates of public conve­nience for the operation of said
units are also in­cluded in the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view, however, of the mani­festation of counsel for DM Transit and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> (Hi) Motors, Inc., to the effect that the certificate
of public convenience was included in the notice of sale and that it was the
intention of the Sheriff (who is now present in open Court), to sell also the
fran­chise, the Commission believes that, in fairness to all, the hearing of
this <span style="">case </span>should
be postponed until JUNE 15, 1965, at 9:00 a.m., to give all the parties
sufficient and ample opportunity to <span style="">present their evidence, </span>pro and con, in
support of their res­pective allegations, and for the Sheriff, if neces<span style="">sary, to make the
corrections if any error has been committed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

1963," and the sale of <span style="">among
others, "the certificate of public convenience issued in PSC Case No.
83104," to be held on June 14, 1965.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

could decide the application, the plaintiff, Juan M. Serrano, filed a motion
with <span style="">drawing the same on the ground
that the mortgagee, Defendant <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> (HI) Motors,
Inc., had violated their agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Until now the Public Service Commission has not acted on the application

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting on the complaint

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Commissioner Medina, </span><span style="">on June 22, 1965, moved for the dismissal of
the complaint against him on three grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the CFI has no jurisdiction over not only the subject-matter of the
action but as well his person as Public Service Commissioner; that the
complaint states no cause of action against him; and that "Article </span><span style="">32 of the Civil </span><span style="">Code is not applicable to judicial
orders."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rest of the
defendants, on the following day, June 23, filed their answer, in which they
alleged, among other things, that the certificate of public convenience issued
in PSC case 83104 is included in the chattel mortgage of August 22, 1963; that
the PSC had in fact approved the said mortgage; that the said certificate was
actually included in the foreclosure sale conducted by the sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, although the latter, through inadvertence,
failed to mention it in the certificate of sale of October 31, 1964; and that
the MHMI has requested the sheriff "to conduct another foreclosure sale in
order to supplement and correct the first one." They further alleged that
the complaint states no cause of action, and that the plaintiffs are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> and guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They accordingly prayed that the complaint be
dismissed as against them, and that the sheriff of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> be ordered to proceed with the foreclosure
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs, on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="7"><span style="">July 8,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, opposed </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">motion to dismiss filed by Commissioner Medina.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="7">July 19,
 1965</st1:date> the CFI dismissed the com­plaint as against Commissioner
Medina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs moved to have
this order set aside or clarified, because it did not specify any ground for
the dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per its order of August
23, 1965 the CFI held in abeyance consideration of the plain­tiffs' prayer for
preliminary injunction, to afford the plain­tiffs opportunity to file a motion
for reconsideration of the order of July 19, and to give the rest of the
defendants equal opportunity to file motions to dismiss, "so that the
court can make a clear cut ruling on the question of jurisdiction over the
instant case."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="8">Augu<span style="">s</span>t 24, 1965</st1:date> the MHMI and
the DMTC moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court has no
jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs there­after filed their
opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1965</st1:date>
the CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the
subject-matter thereof; on the following October 16, it denied the plaintiffs'
motion to set aside the said order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence
the present recourse.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="">we </span>held
that jurisdiction over the subject-matter is determined by the allegations of
the complaint, irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff <span style="">is entitled to recover upon all or some of
the claims asserted therein -- a matter that can be resolved only after and as
a result of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor may the
jurisdiction of the court be made to depend upon t<span style="">he </span></span><span style="">defenses </span><span style="">set up in the answer or upon the motion to
dismiss, for, </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">we to be governed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">such rule, the question </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">jurisdiction would depend almost
entirely upon the defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As can be gleaned from
the portions of the complaint hereinbefore quoted, namely, paragraph 11 in
relation to pa­ragraph 15, and paragraph 6 in relation to paragraph 14, three distinct
issues present themselves for resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraphs 11 and 15
squarely assail the PSC order of <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3">March
 4, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the
appellants, this order "presupposes the existence of a sale and transfer
of the certificate of public convenience issued in Case No. <span style="">83104 </span>by the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City to <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> (Hi) Motors,
Inc., which <span style="">is
</span>not a fact", because the said certificates of public convenience
was not m<span style="">e</span>ntioned in the
sheriff's certificate of sale of October 31, 1964; the PSC order approving provisionally
the sale by the MHMI in favor of the DMTC, of, among others, the said
certificate, and authorizing the latter <span style="">to
</span>operate the line covered thereby, thus deprived Serrano of his property
"without due process of law", and prevented the appellants from
operating the eight units attached to the said certificate and Serrano <span style="">from </span>substituting four of the said
units.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span style="">sum, therefore, paragraphs 11 and 15 assail
the PSC order of March </span><span style="">4, </span><span style="">1965 as erroneous because the MHMI could not
have le­gally transferred the certificate of public convenience in ques­tion to
the DMTC for the </span><span style="">reason </span><span style="">that the sheriff's
certificate of sale of October 31, 1964 did not include the said certificate </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">public convenience among the properties sold to the MHMI in the
foreclosure sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is our view that the
resolution of this aspect of the case falls within the exclusive province of
the PSC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CFI likewise did not
err in dismissing the complaint, even if it prayed for damages against
Commissioner Medina, for <span style="">failure to
state a sufficient cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 32 of the Civil </span>Code, relied upon by the appellants in
support of their claim for damages, <span class="GramE">provides</span> in its
last paragraph that the responsibility for damages "herein set forth is <u><span style="">not demandable </span>from a judge unless his
act or omission constitutes <span style="">a</span>
violation of the Penal Code or other penal statute</u>." We do not now<span style=""> decide -- as we believe we </span>are not
call<span style="">ed </span>upon <span style="">to </span>do so -- <span style="">whether </span>article 32 of the Civil Code may be utilized as the
legal <span style="">basis </span>of an action for
damages against a PSC commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
assum­ing that the said provision of law does authorize recovery of damages
from a member of the PSC in proper cases, the dismissal must yet be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere does the complaint
allege that, <span style="">in issuing the order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3"><span style="">March 4,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, Commissioner
Medina did so in violation of the Revised Penal Code or any other penal

<p class="BODY"><span style="">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the CFI did not err in dismissing the complaint
against the rest of the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint does not state a cause of action against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph <span style="">6 </span>thereof alleges that Serrano filed a motion with the PSC
withdrawing the application filed by him and the MHMI for approval of the
chattel mortgage over the certificate of public convenience in question,
"on the ground that the mortgagee, Defendant <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
(HI) Motors, Inc., had violated their agreement", and, on that basis,
paragraph 14 asserts that "the announced sale on June 14, 1965 is at once
illegal and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the rights of the
plaintiffs", and that if the sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City be not immediately restrained from proceeding with the intended
foreclosure and sale of the said certificate, they "will suffer great and
irreparable injury".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
averments are altogether too imprecise and therefore can­not be dignified as
constituting a legally sufficient statement of the "ultimate facts"
required in the formulation of a cause of action; they are at best mere
conclusions of law which, ob­viously, cannot take the place of "ultimate
facts."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
