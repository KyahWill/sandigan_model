"De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship Co. <span style="">Inc., </span><span style="">plaintiff, versus National Developmen</span>t Company,
defendant".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is </span>the <span style="">third time </span>that this case has come up
to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case is the outcome of an agreement entered into on October
26, 1949 between the De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship Co. Inc.
(hereinafter referred to as De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>) and the <span style="">National Development Company (hereinafter
referred to as N</span><span style="">DC), </span><span style="">whereby De la <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rama</span></span><span style=""> undertook the ma</span>nagement of<span style=""> </span></span><span style="">the </span><span style="">three vessels known as "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Aurora",
“<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>” and “<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Alicia” which had </span><span style="">been purchased by <span style="">the
Philippine G</span></span><span style="">overnment </span><span style="">from Japan with the advice and </span><span style="">technical super</span><span style="">vision of <span style="">De </span>la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
management contract it was provided that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
had the option to buy the ves</span><span style="">sels
</span><span style="">at the fifth year following the
purchase and delivery of each of the vessels, at a price which is to con</span><span style="">sist of the cost </span><span style="">price of each vessel, plus such expenses as
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> may have incurred in connection with the
construction, outfitting, provisioning and operation thereof; but should De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> fail to exercise the right of option it should be
reimbursed of the expenses it incurred in manning, equipping, fueling,
overhauling and repairing the vessels, and the payment of loading commission,
discharging commission, overriding commission, sub-agent's commission etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first time that this case came up to this Court was in G. R.
No. L-8784, decided on <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1956</st1:date>,
which involved the principal question regarding the right granted by the
management contract to NDC to cancel upon one year's notice the general agency
granted De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The NDC decided to cancel the contract but was opposed by De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, which alleged <span style="">that
</span>it had been granted the option to purchase the vessels and that in 1952
it exercised that right of option.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the decision in G.R. No.L-8784 this Court upheld the right of NDC to cancel the
management contract, and the option of De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to
purchase the vessels was declared ineffective.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right of NDC to cancel the management contract <span style="">having </span>been upheld by this Court and
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama's</span> right to exercise the option to purchase
the vessels could not thereby be exercised, De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
filed on August 21, 1956 a "Supplemental Pleading" in Civil Case No.
25161 then pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This supplemental pleading, in the nature of
a supplemental complaint, gave rise to the proceeding which later brought Civil
Case No. 25161 to this Court for the second time in G.R. No. L-25659.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the first cause of action of the "Supplemental Pleading", De la
<span class="SpellE">Rama</span> demanded that NDC refrain from using the names
"<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Aurora", "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nati</span>" and <span style="">'"<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> </span>Alicia" on the three vessels subject of
the original action, claiming that it had acquired exclusive pro­perty right to
the use of said names of the three vessels as trade names; under the second
cause of action, De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> sought <span style="">the payment to it by the NDC of P1,505,603.82
as reimbursement </span>for various advances and expenses it had made in behalf
of, and commissions earned as agent of, NDC; and under the third cause of
action, De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> sought the payment of P1,000,000
as damages on account of <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> continued use of the
names "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Aurora", "Dona <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>" and <span style="">"<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> </span>Alicia", on the <span style="">vessels </span>that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> had turned over
to it (NDC), and P100,000 <span style="">as </span>expenses
and attorney's fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Over the opposition <span style="">of
NDC to </span>the admission of the "Supplemental Pleading", upon the
grounds that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> could not file a <span style="">supplemental </span>pleading because it had
already been <span style="">held in </span><span style="">G. </span><span style="">R. No. </span>L-8784 that it had no right of
action and <span style="">a party may </span>not file
a supplement<span style="">al pleading if it </span>had
no <span style="">valid </span>and subsisting cause of
action, and that all the causes pleaded were only remotely connected with, and
not material to, the original action in Civil Case No. 25161, the lower court,
in an order <span style="">dated </span>October 18,
1956, granted De la <span class="SpellE">Rama's</span> motion to file the
"Supplemental Pleading".<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer to De la <span class="SpellE">Rama's</span>
supplemental pleading, NDC denied De la <span class="SpellE">Rama's</span>
exclusive right to use the names "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
Aurora", "Dona <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>", <span style="">and </span>"<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
<span style="">Alicia" </span>on the vessels
upon the ground that said names (except <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>) represented names of wives of former Presidents of
the Philippines and could not be appropriated by a private individual; NDC
averred that the alleged advances and commissions claimed in the second cause of
action were never alleged and claimed in the original complaint and should be
deemed barred and dismissed together with the original principal action; NDC
also averred that the demands in the third cause of action were unreasonable,
and that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> had tried to retain all the
benefits arising from the operation of the vessels and shifted to NDC the <span style="">liabilities and obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NDC also set </span>forth special defenses
and a counterclaim, alleging that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> was
under <span style="">obligation </span>to submit a
true and correct accounting of the operation of the three vessels, and to remit
to NDC the amounts due to the latter from January 1, 1954 to the dates the
vessels were separately returned; and that plaintiff had charged excessive
commissions of 17-1/2% when the reasonable rate should only be 9.45% after the
notice of cancellation, and should account for and deliver to NDC the excess
commissions actually received.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its reply to <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> answer, and in
its answer to <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> counterclaim, De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> alleged that the names "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
Aurora", <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>"
and "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Alicia" were its property, having
used the name "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" on <span style="">its </span>vessels in its shipping business
even before the last <span style="">war </span>and had acquired a vested right on that trade name, that the
claims for reimbursement and/or payment of advances and/or expenses made, and
commissions earned by virtue and pursuant to the management contract matured
after the filing of the amended complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>;
that true and correct ac­counting of the operations of the vessels had always
been submitted to NDC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> denied, for lack of knowledge or information
sufficient to form a belief, the allegations in defendant's counterclaim.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 20, 1957, the trial court, in consonance with its order
given in open court on March 8, 1957, considering that the case involved mainly
accounting, issued an order appointing <span style="">a
</span>Board of Accountants to make an examination of the accounts submitted by
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to determine what amount is due De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> and what amount is due NDC, and to make such
recommendations as, in its opinion, are proper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court appointed Mr. Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Lecaros</span>, then
President of the Philippine Institute of Accountants, to represent the court
and to act as chairman of the Board; Mr. Miguel <span class="SpellE">Caliñgasan</span>,
comptroller of De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, recommended by counsel for

thirty days from the date of qualification by its members within which to

<p class="BODY">From the above-mentioned decision NDC interposed an appeal to this
Court, docketed herein as G.R. No. L-15659.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is the second time that Civil Case No. 25161 of the Court of First
Instance of Manila came up to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision in G.R. No. L-15659 this Court upheld <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> contention that the causes of action in the
"Supplemental Pleading" were not in any way relevant and material to
the original action of De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to compel the NDC
to sell the three "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" vessels to it, and
that, therefore, the "Supplemental Pleading" was improperly
admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court also sustained the
con­tention of the NDC that the lower court did not follow the suggestion of
the Chairman of the Board of Account­ants to give opportunity to the NDC to
submit its objections to the amounts stated in the report of the chairman of
the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court therefore, set
aside the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in the interest of a prompt termination of the suit, this Court
ordered the remand of the case to the court below "with instructions to
enroll the pleadings and papers starting with the 'supplemental pleading',
registering the complaint, collecting the corresponding fee based on the
amounts demanded in the complaint and entering the complaint and all the papers
in the dockets of the court." This Court also gave instructions "to
give the defendant NDC the opportunity to submit its objections to the report
of the board of accountants and to have a hearing on this report in accordance
wit<span style="">h </span>the rules as above pointed
out", and "thereafter the action shall proceed or continue in
accordance with this decision".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">So the case was before the trial court for the third
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court complied
with the instructions of this Court, as stated in the decision in G.R. No.
L-15659. After the trial court had repeatedly given the NDC the opportunity to
file its objections, if any, to the report submitted by the Chairman of the <span style="">Board of Accountants, and </span><span style="">the NDC </span><span style="">failed so to do, the trial court rendered </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">decision dated </span><st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="2"><span style="">February 23, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">dispositive</span></span><span style=""> part of which </span><span style="">reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, NDC neglected to perform the duty of pointing
and demonstrating the alleged errors in the report of the Board of Accountants,
in spite of <span style="">the </span><span style="">fact </span>that this Court in G.R. No.
L-15659 had ordered the case to be remanded to the lower court precisely in
order that NDC might be given the opportunity, which it claimed it had
previously been deprived of by the trial court, to submit its objections to the
report, and to have a hearing on the report, notwithstanding the repeated
opportunities given to it by the trial court <span style="">for </span>a period of three years to submit its objections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this matter, the following is what the
trial court said in its decision which is now appealed to this Court:</p>

<blockquote>“...and, as directed by the Supreme Court,
the defendant was given repeated opportunities to submit its objections to the
Report of the Chairman of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, however, the defendant's conduct for the last three years
amounts to waiver of its right to be heard <span style="">on </span>the subject report, to paraphrase
the language of the Supreme Court in this regard in <span style="">its decision quoted </span>above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, defendant NDC requested and was granted
on <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1963</st1:date> a
first extension of time to submit its objections to the Report (p. 1342, Re­cords).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As late as <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1963</st1:date> <span style="">(p.
1390, Records), that </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">after several
extensions of time <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> more than one (1) year,
this Court granted NDC </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">final
and last extension of three weeks within which to submit <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span>
objections, if any, to said Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
period expired without the filing by defendant NDC of ob­jections, if any, to
said Report; but this Court, notwithstanding the absence of any objection to
said Report, and with a view to giving the defendant </span><span style="">a last chance to
assail any part of said Report, exercised its discretion </span><span style="">to, as it did, set said Report for hearing </span><span style="">on May </span><span style="">3, 1965 (p. 1395, Records), and thereafter on
May 6, May 28, July 9, August 5, </span><span style="">September </span><span style="">16, October 22 and November 12, 1965, </span><span style="">which hearings were cancelled at the instance
and request of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u><span style="">At the hearing on November <span style="">12, 1965 the parties agreed that defendant </span>be
granted </span></u><u><span style="">two </span></u><u><span style="">weeks within which
to file its objections, </span></u><u><span style="">if
any, to said Report; </span></u><u><span style="">that

within said stipulated period it shall be deemed to have waived its right to do
</span></u><u><span style="">so.</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The defendant again failed to file its
objections to said Report, and instead filed an urgent motion, dated November
26, 1965, to extend the period, but said urgent motion was filed after several
days after the expiration of the period granted for the purpose in this Court's
Order of November 12, 1965, and </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the
defendant actually failed to file the intended objections within the extension
of time prayed for in said urgent motion (see Order of this Court of December
7, 1965), on motion of the plaintiff this Court found no other alternative
proper under the circumstances mentioned above than to issue its Order of
December 13, 1965 to the effect that said Report was deemed submitted for
decision and/or approval as of the last mentioned date."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant having failed to file its objections to the report,
it was the duty imposed by the law upon the court, to quote again <span class="SpellE">Kriedt</span> vs. E. C. McCullough &amp; Co. <u>supra</u>,

<p class="BODY">Another reason why <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> first four
assignments of errors should no longer be considered is that, as appears in the

deemed to have <u>waived </u><u><span style="">its

this Court refused to consider on appeal the correctness of the amount due from
appellant to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as found by the Commissioner,
it being <u>too</u> <u>late</u> to question on appeal its correctness, the same

<p class="BODY">In support of the fifth assignment of error, that the lower court
erred in holding that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> is entitled to the
preferential right to the use of the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>"
names and enjoining and restraining NDC perpetually from using the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" names on any of its vessels, NDC argues that as
owner of the vessels it had registered the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>"
names in the Bureau of Customs with full knowledge and consent of De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> which, therefore, is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>

De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, on the other hand, maintains that the

pertinent portion of the lower court's decision, are well founded.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the amendatory decision, dated March 18, 1966, the lower court
found that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> had been in the shipping
business since 1933 and had adopted, prior to the war in 1941, the word "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" in designating its vessels; that the three
ocean-going vessels that it operated under the management contract were named
"Dona <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>" after the wife of the late Don
Esteban de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, who was founder of the steamship
company; "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Alicia" after the late wife
of former President <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>;
and "Dona Aurora" after the late widow of President Manuel <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>; that there is <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>
testimony that in the shipping business, goodwill and reputation are inevitably
acquired by the names given to a vessel.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> contention, in its answer, that
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, a private firm, could not appropriate
said names (except "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>")
on the ground that those are names of wives of former Presidents, does not have
a legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 4 (c) of
Rep. <span style="">Act No. </span>166
as amended, which apparently is the basis of the contention of NDC, what is
prohibited from being appropriated and being registered are trade-names <span style="">consisting </span>of,
or com­prising, a name identifying a particular living individual, or the name
of a <span style="">deceased
President </span>of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
names of deceased <span style="">wives of Presidents </span>are not included in the prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Section <span style="">4 (f) </span>of said Act does not prohibit the registration, and hence
appropriation, of a trade-name that has become distinctive; and the substantial
and exclusive use of <span style="">a </span>trade-n<span style="">ame </span>for five
years <span style="">is </span>accepted as <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> proof that the trade-name has become distinctive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this Court has said, in <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>,
that even a name or phrase not capable of appropriation as a trade name may, by
long and exclusive use by a business with reference thereto or to its products,
acquire a proprietary con­notation, such that, to the purchasing public, the <span style="">name </span>or
phrase becomes associated <span style="">with </span>the
service <span style="">or
the </span>products of the business, and so it is entitled to pro­tection
against unfair competition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the claim <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, allegedly based on acquiescence, in that NDC had
registered with full knowledge and/or consent of De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" <span style="">names </span>in the Bureau of Customs,
tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reading of Sections 1166 to
1176 of the Revised Administrative Code, under which the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" vessels were presumably registered, would show <span style="">that </span>the primary purpose of the
registration is to determine the ownership of the vessels, although for
registration it is necessary that the vessel should have a name as a
prerequisite under the provision of Section 1170.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">De </span>la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
certainly could not, and had no right, to oppose <span style="">the </span>registration of the vessels by NDC <span style="">because the vessels </span>were in fact owned by NDC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither could De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
then oppose the registration <span style="">of </span>the
<span style="">"<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>"
names of </span>the vessels for it was De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
itself that gave those names when it operated the vessels, and it had also an
expectant right to become owners of <span style="">said </span>vessels.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>De la <span class="SpellE">Rama's</span> consent to the registration <span style="">of </span>the
vessels as owned by <span style="">NDC </span>did not necessarily imply that it also consented to <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> appropriation of the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>"
names, for almost immediately after the right of NDC to cancel the management
contract had been upheld by this Court in <span style="">G. </span>R. No. L-8784, decided on <span style="">May 21, </span>1956, <span style="">De la </span><span class="SpellE">Rama</span> formally notified, on
August 10, 1956 NDC or its agent to "refrain from using, announcing or in
any manner referring to the three <span style="">vessels here in </span>question as the '<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Aurora,' '<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>' or '<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Alicia'."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
From these facts it <span style="">cannot reasonably </span>be urged that De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from preventing NDC to use the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" names on its <span style="">vessels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Anent this </span>matter,
<span style="">it </span>has been held that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> will not ordinarily arise from a consent given
under an excusable misapprehension of facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">likewise, the <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
</span>will <span style="">not be </span><span style="">given </span>effect beyond the precise thing

implied <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>." (28 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>

<p class="BODY">And even if it <span style="">be assumed, <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span><u>,</u>
that De </span>la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> acquiesced to the registration
of the "Dona" names of the vessels, as NDC contends, that <span style="">acquiesc</span>ence
could not necessarily <span class="SpellE">estop</span> <span style="">De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to claim
its </span>right to said names, after the conditions had changed, that is, when
the management contract had been cancelled by NDC. Regarding this matter <span style="">it </span>has been held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Acquiescence in the past does not necessarily <span class="SpellE">estop</span> a party from changing his course of conduct as to the
future, especially where there has been a change in conditions." (28 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2d, p. 675.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">NDC does not dispute the fact that the "Dona" names had
been originally used by De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>,
and accord­ing to the lower court De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> had been
using the "<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>" names even before the war,
and that said names have acquired goodwill <span style="">and reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Goodwill is pro</span>tected by the law on

damaged, and is easily vulnerable to assault, through the brand which
symbolizes it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a person has
established a trade or business <span style="">in
which </span>he <span style="">has used </span>a name or device to designate his goods, he will <span style="">be protected in </span>the

the <span style="">name or

this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The owner of a trade-mark or trade-name has a property right
in which he is entitled to protection, since there is damage to him from
confusion of reputation or goodwill in the mind of the public as <span style="">well as confusion of goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The modern trend is to give emphasis to the
unfairness of the acts and to treat the issue as a fraud."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To permit NDC to continue using the "Dona" names would
be to countenance the unlawful appropriation of the benefit of a goodwill which
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> has acquired as a result of continued
usage and large expense; it would be tantamount to permitting <span style="">NDC </span>to grab the reputation or goodwill
of the business of another.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
We find that the decision of the trial court on this matter is in accordance
with the law on unfair competition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding <span class="SpellE">NDC's</span> sixth assignment of
