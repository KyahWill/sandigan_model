				<H3>COMMUNITY SAWMILL COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS. COURT
OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, AND COMMUNITY EFFORT LABOR UNION, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review an order of
the Court of Industrial Relations, denying a motion for the reopening of a case
wherein petitioner company as respondent was required to pay the total amount
of P128,920.50 by way of back wages.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner would seek a reduction of its liability for such payment on the
ground that its responsibility to pay compensation ought to have ceased as far
back as November 30, 1957, when it closed shop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If indeed there was such an arbitrary disregard of such a fact, then
there is plausibility to its contention that the assailed order could be
stigmatized as a denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its own printed petition for <i>certiorari</i>, containing the order
sought to be set, does not justify such a claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After referring to such motion by present
petitioner, as respondent,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to reopen the proceedings and to allow the introduction of evidence seek­ing to
reduce its liability and after setting forth that complainant labor union, now
respondent, formally opposed such pleading, its opposition coming after two years,
the order continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The parties
adduced their respective evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Record reveals that respondents, through counsel, received a copy of the
Court Examiner's Report on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11">November
 21, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Report clearly
indicated that ‘[par.] 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total
amount of back wages of the claimants in this case from the time they were
dismissed up to November 11, 1961 is P128.920.50 * * *.' Record likewise shows
that on November 18, 1961, counsel for respondent company and its manager were
furnished copies of complainant's 'Motion to Deposit &amp; Execution' which ‘*
* * prayed that this Honorable Court order the Respondents to deposit the sum
of P128,920.50 as computed by the examiner of this Court.' But, as found in the
Order of <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1961</st1:date>,
directing that the amount be deposited in Court,' <span style="">* * * </span>respondents has not as yet filed any opposition thereto.'
Record further shows that counsel for respondent company or sawmill received a
copy of this Order on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="12">December 13,
 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the
Motion to Re-open was filed only on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="12">December
 28, 1961</st1:date>, or more than ten (10) days after receipt of the Order of <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1961</st1:date>, there is no doubt
that the same was filed after the Order had long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
facts show that the motion has no basis."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The care taken by the labor tribunal to take into consideration the equitable
aspects of this controversy is manifest in this portion of the opinion of the
then Judge <span class="SpellE">Ansberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If, as contended, respondent company
had ceased operation on November 30, 1957, the back wages should end up to that
date and no more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so, if
such contention were true, for even if the workers concerned were not separated
from work they could not have worked after <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1957</st1:date>, because of the alleged stoppage of
operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To give them back wages
thereafter would be to place them in a position better than that of being
dismissed."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> made quite apparent why
the effort of petitioner should come to naught.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Even as the Motion to
Re-open, which is verified, admits that a copy of the Order approving the
Examiner's Report and directing the deposit of P128,920.50 with the Court, was
received on December 13, 1961, the same motion attempts to justify its
belatedness by alleging, among others, that ‘* * * Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span>,
the respondent's former Manager, came to the undersigned's office after many
weeks of absence * * *.' What an unnerving (<u>sic</u>) reason that would set
aside the legal rule and consequence that notice to counsel is notice to
client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for respondent Community
Sawmill had been put on notice respecting the period covered by the back wages
since he received on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11">November 21,
 1961</st1:date>, a copy of the Court Examiner's Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span style="">his
</span>duty to inform his client about the Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the affidavit of Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span>
attached to the Motion to Re-open as well as his testimony, counsel for
respondent sawmill could have easily contacted Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span>
because the latter admitted having resided in the compound of respondent
sawmill even during the time the operation of the sawmill allegedly had ceased
(pages 24 to 25, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. of February 16, 1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this is not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company claims that since it
ceased operation on <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1957</st1:date>,
it did not operate anymore because it leased the sawmill and other machineries
to the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Eastern Sawmill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence (Exhibits '5', ‘5-A' and '5-B')
show, however, that it had some activities in 1959, when trips were made to <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, on (to quote
the document themselves) 'a/c of Community Saw Mill Co.' The authority for the
trips and payment thereof was under the signature of Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span>,
the same person on the strength of whose affidavit, among others, the Motion to
Re-open was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise shown
by Exhibit '6' that 'manager' Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span> himself had
something to do with the business of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Eastern
Saw Mill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact established by
this evidence that he (Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span>) received from Luis <span class="SpellE">Infantado</span> the sum of P2,160.00 ‘* * * for services rendered
by the Company's tractor for hauling 540 Cu. M. of logs * * *.' And this
receipt was issued under the heading '<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:place>
Eastern Saw Mill’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span> had attempted to explain away the adverse effect of
this document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the truth remains
that while the receipt signed by him nominally that of the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
Eastern Saw Mill, actually it was for respondent Community Saw Mill Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again it is established by <span class="SpellE">movant</span>-company's own evidence (Exhibit 'E-<span class="SpellE">Resp</span>.') which is the Sawmill Permit, No. 88-59 for the
fiscal year ending June 1959, dated July 9, 1958, that the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
Eastern Sawmill '* * * is the former Community Sawmill Co., Ltd., * * *.' This
is one of the documents brought to Court by the Chief of the Sawmill Section,
Sawmills and Licenses Division of the Bureau of Forestry, at the hearing on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testifying on this document and other
documents brought to court by virtue of a subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span>
<span class="SpellE">tecum</span>, the Chief of the Sawmill Section (when asked
whether, after the sawmill permit for July 1, 1957 up to June 30, 1958 was
issued in favor of respondent Community Saw Mill Co., another permit was issued
the same respondent) declared that ‘* * * this Community Sawmill Company is now
the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Eastern Sawmill, according to the
record.' (page 17, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., of <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1963</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hastening to explain his statement, he declared
that what ‘* * * I mean the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Sawmill is a
successor only to the Community Sawmill.' (page 25, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.
of <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1963</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, the fact remains that in
the Sawmill Permit No. 138-' 60 issued in favor of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
Eastern Sawmill (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'F'), being one of the
documents brought to court by the said Section Chief, Lee <span class="SpellE">Koc</span>,
signing for <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Eastern Sawmill, stated that
'This is to certify that I am willing to pay any increase sawmill permit fee
due to increase capacity of <u>my</u> sawmill after the District Forester, <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
inspected <u>my</u> sawmill.' With this statement and the other facts herein
analyzed, the Court is morally certain that respondent Community Sawmill Co.,
Ltd. is not at all entitled to the beneficent effects of equity."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent why this petition should be dismissed for
lack of merit.</p>

<blockquote>1. Even a cursory perusal of the order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
affirmed in a resolution by the Court of Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
on February 16, 1965, did indicate that the imputation of arbitrariness,
allegedly consisting of imposing a liability for back wages on petitioner even
after it had ceased business operation is devoid of support in the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that
painstaking care was taken by the then Judge <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>
to appraise the competent and credible evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, it did require a
certain degree of temerity on the part of petitioner to raise an issue that it
ought to have known would be disproved by the very actuation of its
officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was indicative of the
stubbornness on its part to refuse compliance with what the law requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, the allegation of
blatant disregard of the proof submitted as to petitioner having ceased to do
business as of <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1957</st1:date>
clearly lacks foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No due process
question arose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The facts as found were set forth with clarity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their conformity to what did transpire <span style="">is </span>quite
evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For petitioner to expect that
this Court could rule otherwise <span style="">is </span>entirely unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would constitute a marked departure from
authoritative precedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing is
better settled than that finding of facts, if supported by substantial evidence,
of the Court of Industrial Relations are accorded full respect by this Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That has been the norm since <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> Employees' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> v. Court
of Industrial Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
