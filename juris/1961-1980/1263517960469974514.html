				<H3>HON. NICOLAS C. ADOLFO, MUNICIPAL JUDGE OF THE MUNICIPALITY
OF SUBIC, PROVINCE OF ZAMBALES,
PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ZAMBALES, BRANCH I,
HON. LUCAS LACSON, PRESIDING, AND ALBERT L. MERCHANT,

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In filing this petition for review on certiorari, on September 1,
1969, the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, the Honorable Nicolas C. Adolfo, against the
Court of First Instance of that province and a certain Albert L. Merchant, as
respondents, would have us reverse and set aside a decision of respondent Court
of November 20, 1968 annulling petitioner's order of June 29, 1967 in a
criminal case pending before him declaring as non-existent the custody receipt
issued by the Commander of the United States Naval Base at <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>
Bay for the provisional liberty of the respondent Albert L. Merchant, the
accused in that case, so that the warrant for his arrest could be reissued
pursuant to Article 13 of the United States -Philippines Military Bases
Agreement of 1937.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition quoted
the specific provision of paragraph 5 of the aforesaid article in the 1947
Military Bases Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worded
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>In all cases over which
the Philippines exercises jurisdiction</u> the custody of the accused, pending
trial and final judgment, shall be entrusted without delay to the commanding
officer of the nearest base, who shall acknowledge in writing that such accused
has been delivered to him for custody pending trial in a competent court of the
Philippines and that he will be held ready to appear and will be produced
before said court when required by it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The commanding officer shall be furnished by the fiscal (prosecuting
attorney) with a copy of the information against the accused upon the filing of
the original in the competent court."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It likewise alleged that the clause "in all cases over which the
Philippines exercises jurisdiction" did obviously refer to the second
paragraph of the same article which reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"2. The Philippines shall have the right to exercise jurisdiction
over all other offenses <u>committed outside the bases by an member of the
armed forces of the United States</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After which came this assertion in the petition:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is no dispute that the crime for
which respondent Albert L. Merchant is charged was committed outside a base, or
more particularly in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Manggahan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent, though a citizen of the
United States, is a civilian employee or component of the U. S. Naval Base at <span class="SpellE">Subic</span> Bay, thus not a member of the armed forces of the
United States within the purview of the oft-repeated Base Agreement."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, represented by the then Solicitor General, the
Honorable Felix <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, took due 'note of the stand
of respondent Court and of private respondent which is that "even if the
right of custody of a commanding officer over the person of an accused civilian
component of the base is not prescribed by the original Base Agreement,
nonetheless such a right is now provided for in paragraph 5 of the Agreed
Official Minutes of the Agreement entered into between the Philippines and the
United States on August 10, 1965, to wit: '5. In all cases over which the
Republic of the Philippines exercises juris­diction, <u>the custody of an
accused</u> member of the United States armed forces, <u>civilian component</u>,
or dependent, <u>pending investigation, trial and final judgment, shall be
entrusted without delay to the commanding officer of the nearest base</u>, who
shall acknowledge in writing (a) that such accused has been delivered to him
for custody pending investigation, trial and final judgment in a competent
court of the Philippines (b) that he will be made available to the Philippine
authorities for investigation upon their request and (c) that he will be produced
before said court when required by it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The commanding officer shall be furnished by the fiscal (prosecuting
attorney) with a copy of the information against the accused upon the filing of
the original in the competent court."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition thus squarely raised in issue the validity of the
exchange of notes on August 10, 1965, more commonly known as the Mendez-Blair
Agreement insofar as it would modify or amend the provisions of the Military
Bases Agreement without such exchange of notes having been submitted to the
Senate for ratification as the Constitution requires in the case of
treaties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made a distinction between
a treaty and executive agreements, to which category the aforesaid exchange of
notes belongs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "A treaty may
be defined as a compact made between two or more independent nations with a
view to the public welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> &amp; Fernando, Constitution of the Philippines, 4th
Edition, Vol. II, citing Altman &amp; Co. vs. United States, 224 U.S.
583).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Executive Agreements fall into two
classes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) agreements made purely as
executive acts effecting external relations and independent of or without
legislative authorization, termed as 'presidential agreements', and (2)
agreements entered into in pursuance to acts of Congress, designated as Congressional-Executive
Agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(USAFFE Veterans Association
Inc. vs. The Treasurer of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
et al., 105 Phil. 1030, 1038<span class="GramE">; citing</span> several
authorities).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the distinction
between a 'treaty' <span class="GramE">or</span> the so-called 'executive
agreements' is best understood by statements of what they are supposed to
cover, including examples thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
we can find in the above-cited case of the Commissioner of Customs vs. Eastern
Sea Trading, <u>supra</u>, citing U.S. authorities, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'International agreements involving <u>political
issues or changes of national policy and those involving international
arrangements of a permanent character usually take the form of treaties.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But international agreements embodying <u>adjustments
of detail carrying out well-established national policies and traditions</u>
and those involving <u>arrangements of a more or less temporary nature</u>
usually take the form of <u>executive agreements</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After citing an article of Francis B. Sayre on "The Constitutionality of
Trade Agreement Acts"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
it concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We can thus see that
executive agreements cover such subjects as commercial and consular relations,
property relations like patent rights, trademark and copyrights, postal,
navigation, settlement of private claims, tariff and trade matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These types of agreements are certainly not
in the plane of one, like the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
- P.I. Military Bases Agreement, which affects and reduces to a certain degree
the territorial authority, the jurisdiction and even the dignity of the country
and its people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Base Agreement
undoubtedly involves more than a national policy, and is practically of a
permanent nature (99 years or longer, Art. <span class="GramE">XXIX, <u>ibid</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, said Agreement is a treaty which
must be ratified, as it was ratified, by the Senate."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The petition reinforced the above conclusion with this argument:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Since the power to <u>make</u> treaties
is lodged under our Constitution with the President with the concurrence of
two-thirds of the Senate, the power to <u>amend </u>these treaties must
similarly be vested in those organs of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, an amendment to a statute produces
one law, usually the statute as amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Black, Interpretation of Laws, p. 574).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>materia</u></span> is the observation that only Congress, with
its legislative power, can make laws and alter or repeal them (Cooley, p.
183).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Executive, with all his
vast powers, cannot suspend the operation of a statute (Philippine National
Bank vs. <span class="SpellE">Bitulok</span> Sawmill Inc., et al., G. R.
L-24177-85, June 29, 1968); <u>a</u> <u>fortiori</u>, he cannot exercise the
greater power to amend or to revoke a statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, as applied to this case, the making of the treaty having been
undertaken under the joint auspices of the President and the Senate, its
amendment or revision must similarly be undertaken by both agencies of the
State as directed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The August 10, 1965 notes to the U.S. - P.I. Military Bases Agreement of
1947, not having been ratified yet by the Senate, remain as mere
proposals."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The answer for respondents, filed on October 25, 1969, after it
admitted substantially the statement of facts, agreed as to the decisive issue
being the validity of the exchange of notes of August 10, 1965, which they
would uphold, being, in their opinion, in accord with law and established
precedents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The brief for petitioner-appellant was filed on February 26,
1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a motion for the extension
of time to file the brief for respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
was filed on April 27, 1970, they filed a motion to dismiss on May 6, 1970,
wherein it was noted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"By a letter
dated April 16, 1970 which was received on April 20, 1970, Rear Admiral V. G.
Lambert, Commander of the U.S. Naval Base at <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>
Bay, advised petitioner-appellant Judge Nicolas G. Adolfo as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'This is in reference to Criminal Case No.
1625 in which Albert L. Merchant is charged with the crime of 'Less Serious
Physical Injuries thru Reckless Imprudence.'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Please be advised that, upon the request of Albert L. Merchant, the
custody receipt issued on 26 June 1967 in accordance with Article XIII of the
Military Bases Agreement, as revised on 10 August 1965, is hereby withdrawn;
and the undersigned can no longer be held responsible for his presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We understand that Mr. Merchant is taking
this action because he desires to have his case finally adjudicated in your
Court at the earliest possible time.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Mention was likewise made of the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"On April 20, 1970, Albert L. Merchant, through counsel, submitted
a <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> to the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'[Comes now] the accused in the
above-entitled case, by his undersigned counsel, and, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 14, Rule 114, of the Rules of Court, to this Honorable
Court respectfully submits the certificate from the Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, dated April 20,
1970, that the sum of Six Hundred Pesos (P600.00), Philippine currency, has
been deposited as Cash Bond Deposit for the accused in the above-entitled case,
under Official Receipt No. M-8888315 dated April 20, 1970, as well as a Xerox copy
of said official receipt, which are marked as Annexes 'A' and 'B',
respectively, and made integral parts hereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>[Wherefore], it is most respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that
the warrant for the arrest of the accused be recalled or the accused be
released from custody in accordance with the provisions of Section 14, Rule
114, of the Rules of Court.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss was referred for comment to
petitioner-appellant in a resolution of May 15, 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The comment came in the form of a manifestation
filed with us on June 2, 1970, the pertinent portion of which reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That as thus crystallized, the issue is
the validity of the custodial receipt issued by the Commander of the US Naval
Base at <span class="SpellE">Subic</span> Bay over the person of respondent
Albert L. Merchant who is a civilian component of the United States Navy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is appellant's contention that custodial
authority over the person of a civilian component by the U.S. Base Commander is
not provided for in the original US-P.I. Military Bases Agreement of 1947,
though it is now the subject of the so-called Mendez-Blair Agreement of August
10, 1965; and 2. That considering the fact that the custody receipt over the
person of Albert L. Merchant has already been withdrawn by the Base Commander
and Merchant has offered to submit a cash bond, in lieu of said receipt, before
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
the question with regard to said custodial authority has indeed become moot and
academic."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question raised is one the importance of which cannot be
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately the turn of events
clearly reflects a change of mind on the part of respondent Albert L. Merchant
manifesting respect towards the terms of the Military Bases Agreement prior to
its alleged modification in the exchange of notes of August 10, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its validity could have been passed upon in
this case were it not for such respondent Merchant's recognition of the
controlling force and effect of the explicit provision in the Military Bases
Agreement as ratified by the Senate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
things stand now however, the determination of such crucial question must await
another day, the matter having become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the absence of any objection to the
dismissal of this petition by petitioner-appellant, this petition for review on
certiorari is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without pronouncement as to costs.</span></p>
