bidders;</blockquote>

facts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully submitted
that a decision be rendered on the foregoing stipulation of facts."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The following facts are, therefore, beyond dispute:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1947" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1947</st1:date>
Juana A. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> sold under <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span>
<u>de</u> <u>retro</u> to appellants a portion of 8,607 square meters of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
4, Plan Psu-95433 which had a total area of 30,015 square meters, the deed
having been registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> only on <st1:date year="1957" day="4" month="12">December
 4, 1957</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, on January 26, 1949 Juana A. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and her husband, <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Mangonon</span>, mortgaged, along with other parcels of
unregistered land, the whole of Lot 4, to the spouses Faustino Oviedo and
Patricia Mendoza, to secure the payment of a loan amounting to P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of mortgage was registered in the
Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> on <st1:date year="1949" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1949</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, because of the mortgagors'
failure to pay the principal obligation, the mortgage was foreclosed (Civil
Case No. 12149, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>),
as a result of which the mortgaged properties were sold at public auction, the <st1:city><st1:place>Oviedo</st1:place></st1:city>
spouses having been the successful bidders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sheriff's certificate of sale executed in their favor was registered
on <st1:date year="1957" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1957</st1:date>; on October
24 of the same year the court confirmed or approved the foreclosure sale, and a
writ of possession was issued on <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="11">November
 21, 1957</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is it disputed that the ten-year period for repurchase
stipulated between Juana A. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, on the one hand,
and <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Garcia and Francisca Valdez, on the
other, expired without the vendor having exercised her right, and that Lot 4,
Plan Psu-95433 was unregistered land at the time of the transactions men­tioned
heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above facts, the decision appealed from could
be sustained had it not been stipulated (Record on Appeal, p. 6) that "the
defendants, vendees <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>, have been paying the land taxes on
the property and getting the products <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> since
<st1:date year="1947" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1947</st1:date> to the
present." Bearing in mind the 8,607 square meters sold <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>
by Juana A. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span>
were part and parcel of Lot 4, whose total area was 30,015 square meters, it
may be presumed that when the Oviedo spouses loaned P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
to Juana A. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and her husband, they were
cognizant of the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Garcias</span> and of the
nature of their claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
before entering into the mortgage transaction, they were in duty-bound to
exercise diligence in connection therewith, such as would enable them to
determine the nature and extent of the rights of the mortgagors in the
properties to be the subject of mortgage, the same being all unregistered
lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had they exercised such diligence
as was expected of them, they would have discovered, without fail, that a
portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 4 had been previously sold <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>
to appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They not having done so,
or having accepted the mortgage on the whole of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 4
with at least a constructive knowledge of the fact that a portion thereof had
been sold <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> to appellants since <st1:date year="1947" day="17" month="5">May 17, <span class="GramE">1947</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> they must respect the rights of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with our jurisprudence, by
virtue of the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>
sale in favor of appellants mentioned heretofore, they automatically acquired
ownership of the property subject matter thereof (<span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span>, L-13646, July 26, 1960; <span class="SpellE">Almirañez</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Devera</span>,
L-19496, February 27, 1965).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed.</p>
