				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The protracted struggle
for supremacy within the ranks of the petitioner Union <span class="SpellE">Obrera</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, Inc., a duly registered labor organization
with headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>,
was brought to a head when the respondent Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span>,
Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, Branch
I, issued on March 8, 1966, in civil case 3182, a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction which ordered, among other things, the placing of the faction headed
by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>
in possession and control of the Union's headquarters and the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> <span class="SpellE">there­from</span> of the other
faction under the petitioner Tito <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A violent encounter between the two
contending groups was narrowly averted when, at dusk of the same day, the
provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> attempted to enforce the
court's writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day,
March 9, at the instance of the respondents <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>,
et al., the court below issued a "breakthrough" order to give teeth
to its injunction, directing the PC command in <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>
to assist the sheriff in its enforcement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The execution of this last order, however, was put off when the sheriff
entered into a three-day moratorium with the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>
to fend off imminent violence in the dispute which affected nearly a thousand
actively interested parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 11
the petitioners </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, Tito <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>,
Andres <span class="SpellE">Bron</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Berces</span>, Andres <span class="SpellE">Borjal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vosotros</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Bragais</span>, Sergio Calla and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Breva</span> came to this Court by way of a special civil
action of certiorari and prohibition with prayer for a preliminary injunc­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 15 we </span>issued a temporary
restraining <span style="">order directing the
respondent judge to desist from enforcing his writ until further orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are supplied by the pleadings of the parties
and the annexes attached thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears that the
continuing feud between <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo's</span> group, on the
one hand, and that of <span class="SpellE">Belangel's</span>, upon the other, is
part of the history of the Union <span class="SpellE">Obrera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, Inc.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> an organization of three decades'
standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>
and several others were suspended a few years back from their membership in that
</span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> which has been largely dominated by <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span> and his group.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A case for unfair labor practice was subsequently lodged by <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> and similarly suspended members against <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span> and company, and the same was docketed in the
Court of Industrial Relations as CIR case 4052-ULP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners Tito <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>, et al.,
allege in their peti­tion before us that on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1966</st1:date>, the Registrar of Labor Organizations of
the Department of Labor approved a member­ship resolution postponing the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
general elections, fixed by the organization's governing laws for <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1966</st1:date>, to March 7 of the
following year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners further
allege that adequate notice of this postponement was conveyed to all union
members prior to March 6.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1966</st1:date>,
however, <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> filed a sup­plementary petition
for injunction in case 4052-ULP of the CIR, alleging that he was being unjustly
prevented from running for the office of Union president in the election set
for <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1966</st1:date> and that
signatures of members were being illegally col­lected to insure the election of
<span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>, his rival.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his prayer, <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> asked the CIR to
order the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and its incumbent officers to proceed
with the general election of March 6, and, further, to recognize <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo's</span> candidacy for president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> also
asked the CIR for assistance in the conduct of that election.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1966</st1:date>,
before <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo's</span> supplementary petition could be
acted upon, a decision was rendered in the main case by Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, reinstating <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> to full membership in the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter decision apparently signaled the
beginning of a revitalized struggle for the control of the organi­zation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer filed
with this Court, the respondents <span class="SpellE">Buen­consejo</span>, et al.
allege that on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="3"><span style="">March </span><span style="">1, </span><span style="">1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, pursuant to their request, the
Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and officer-in-charge of the Bureau
of Labor Relations instructed two of the Department's representatives to
proceed to <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span> to observe the conduct of the
general election set for March 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents further allege that on March 4, a general member­ship meeting
(obviously without the participation and sanction of the Union's incumbent
officers including <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>) was held by the Union
and that it was there decided by the majority that the March 6 election would
be held as originally set by the Union's rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At about the same time, two representatives of the Department of Labor
reportedly requested the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s
secretary in <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span> for a complete list of its
eligible voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(No indica­tion in the
records appears as to whether or not the request was heeded.) On March 5 <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> requested the assistance of both the Philippine
Constabulary and the local police in the con­duct of the election scheduled for
the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on the
morning of March 6, <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> presented himself and
his followers, together with the government representatives he had earlier
mustered, at the doors of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s
building in <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span> and requested <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>
for the use of the Union hall for their projected election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was allegedly rejected by the
latter on the ground that the general election had been earlier officially
postponed for the following year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unable
to make any headway with the incumbent tenants of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s building, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Buenconsejo</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
his group left and conducted their election elsewhere in <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> was
subsequently proclaimed winner with a vote of 623 as against <span class="SpellE">Belangel's</span> 39 votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Others in <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo's</span> ticket were similarly
proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 7 the elected
winners took their oath of office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their petition at bar,
the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>, et al. contend that the
election of March 6 was a farce because only 112 of a total of 994 eligible
voters took part therein, the rest being of questionable status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners add that there </span>were no
prior notice and publication respecting the election as required by <span style="">the </span><st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
governing laws nor were the proper electoral board and committee on electoral
protests constituted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span style="">any </span><span style="">event, on </span><span style="">March 8, a
complaint docketed as civil case 3182 was filed by <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>
and his company of elected officials with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, Branch I, against Tito <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>
and others for usurpation of organization functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint contained an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> petition for a </span><span style="">writ of preliminary mandatory injunction for the immediate ouster of
the defendants and for the installation of <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>
and those supposedly elected with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, the respondent judge issued the writ asked for and
followed the same with a "break­through" order the day after.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present action for certiorari and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Lest this Court be misunderstood,
the validity of the elec­tion of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="3"><span style="">March 6, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> which allegedly saw the election of <span class="SpellE">Buen­consejo</span> and others to positions of power in the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">, is <u>not</u> an issue in the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recitals above were made only
for the purpose of providing a full understanding of the nature of the dispute
between the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The sole question posed
to us by the petition at bar is, whether the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, presided by the respondent judge, had jurisdiction
to issue in civil case 3182 the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction of
March 8, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But beyond this is the
more basic question of whether that court had jurisdiction, in the first place,
over the subject-matter of the case before it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court has invariably
held that </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">jurisdiction of a court over the
subject-matter of an action is determined by the allegations of the complaint.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Let us therefore turn our
attention to the complaint filed by the respondents <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>,
et al., dated </span><st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="3"><span style="">March 8, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, on the basis of which the writ of
preliminary mandatory injunc­tion in question was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In substance, it is there alleged that the
Union <span class="SpellE">Obrera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>,
Inc. is a duly registered labor organization; that <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>
and his co-plaintiffs are duly elected officers of the Union, having been
elected in the election of March 6, 1966 held pursuant to the provisions of the
Union's constitution; and that <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span> and his
co-defendants have con­tinuously refused to relinquish the positions previously
held by them in the organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> and company invoke article 26 of the </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style="">'s constitution as the primary authority
sustaining their right to office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
article </span><span style="">reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Elections</u> -- The Board of Directors as provided for in
Article 4, Chapter 2, shall hold office for two (2) years and shall be elected
only by the DIRECT VOTES of all members thru SECRET BALLOT to be held on the
FIRST SUNDAY of March, commencing MARCH 1964; <span style="">Provided that in such election at least more than one-half (1/2) of the
registered and qualified mem­bers shall take part, and the newly elected
officers shall take oath and qualify on the day following their election."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Ultimately, the mischief sought to be removed by the plain­tiffs'
action is the alleged flaunting by <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span> and the
other incumbent officials of the right of the membership of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
to change its leaders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This actionable
wrong is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 17(c) of Republic Act
875, as amended (otherwise known as the Industrial Peace Act), provides that
violation of the right of the members of a labor organization to elect officers
by secret ballot at intervals of not more than two years shall, after efforts
to correct such violation through procedures evolved by the organization itself,
be disposed of by the Court of Industrial Relations as in "unfair labor
practice" cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> had no power to hear the
case filed by the respondents <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>, et al.,
let alone issue a writ of preliminary man­datory injunction in relation
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By way of postscript to this decision, it should be stated that
on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1966</st1:date>, the
respondents <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>, et al. filed with this Court
an urgent motion to restrain the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Belangel</span>,
et al. from carrying out a projected union election set for <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their telegraphic comment of <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1966</st1:date>, the petitioners opposed
this motion on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Buencon­sejo</span> and his
group are deemed to have withdrawn the same when they subsequently filed their
certificates of candidacy for the <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="5">May
 29, 1966</st1:date> poll.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the
petitioners alleged that the projected election had been submitted to the CIR
in case 4052-ULP(2) for approval and supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another wire sent by the petitioners on <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1966</st1:date> informed this Court that
the CIR had already ap­proved the holding of the election on May 29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a subsequent manifestation, the
petitioners confirmed the contents of their two telegrams and further informed
this Court that on April 30, 1966, a general membership meeting had revoked a
prior reso­lution postponing the Union's general election for one year and had
instead decided to hold the same on May 29, 1966; that on <span style="">May 29, 1966, the election was so held with
the attendance of two hearing commissioners of the CIR and a representative of
the Department of Labor; and that the result of the election has been submitted
to the CIR for its consideration and approval inci­dent to the unfair labor
practice case pending therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1966</st1:date>
the petitioners furnished this Court with copies of the order of the CIR
approving the result of the election of <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="5">May
 29, 1966</st1:date>, together with the corresponding reports of the hearing
commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present petition was
set for oral argument on <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1966</st1:date>
but only the petitioners appeared to argue their case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>,
et al. filed a written manifestation submitting the case for decision without
further argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents'
motion of <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1966</st1:date> has
thus been rendered moot and academic by the above-narrated supervening events.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the said motion the only matter that has become
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the
supervening events above adverted to, it is indubitable that the issues posed
by the complaint <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> have all been resolved by the Court of
Industrial Relations in case 4052-ULP (2) with finality and to the satisfaction
of all the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No useful purpose
will therefore be served in lengthening the life of the case pending in the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition at bar is dismissed, and the
case below, civil case 3182, is hereby likewise ordered dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
