				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, in its case
<span class="GramE">No</span>. <span class="GramE">CA-G.R. No. 32379-R, affirming
the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
in its Civil Case No. 14159-I.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners-spouses, <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Ramos
and <span class="SpellE">Casimira</span> Ramos, al­lege that the Court of
Appeals, in negligence of duty, and contrary to and in violation of Section 33
of the Judiciary Act and Section 4 of Rule 51 of the Rules of Court, completely
ignored an assignment of error raised be­fore it on appeal, contrary to Section
33 of the Judiciary Act that provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 33.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x.</span></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Every decision of the Court of Appeals shall contain complete
findings of fact on all issues properly raised before it.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"X<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 4, Rule 51 of the Rules of Court
is similarly worded, as above.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rosita Ramos and Romeo Ramos had instituted an action in the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Court against <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Casimira</span> Ramos, for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of one-half (1/2) <i style="">pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></i>
of a parcel of land with an area of 25,330 square meters, located in <span class="SpellE">Binmaley</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court found that the land formerly belonged to <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> Ramos and Maria <span class="SpellE">Zarate</span>,
the deceased parents of defendant below, <span class="SpellE">Lam­berto</span>
Ramos; that, against the denial of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>, the
father of both plain­tiffs, Rosita and Romeo Ramos, named Emilio <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Ramos, was <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Lam­berto</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span> deceased brother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> claimed that the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> and Maria agreed that the land in question should
pertain exclusively to him, just as other parcels of land would belong
exclusively to the other heirs, in accordance with a document, marked Exhibit
"1", the court found that <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> had
agreed with the plaintiffs' mother, <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span> de
Guzman, that the land in question would be held in common -- one-half (1/2) to <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> and the other half to Rosita and Romeo; that it
would be registered under the Land Registration Act and converted from a <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> to a fishpond; that, in breach of trust, <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> registered the land and secured Original
Certificate of Title No. 15763 in the name of the conjugal partner­ship of the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Casimira</span>
B. Ramos, now petition­ers-appellants .</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing findings, the trial court ordered the
cancellation of certificate of title No. 15763; the execution by defendants of
a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of one-half (1/2) of the land
to the plaintiffs; the issuance of a transfer certificate of title in
accordance with the trust agreement and the payment of damages and attorneys'
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, assigning the
following errors:</p>

<blockquote>“(1) In holding that the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Placido</span>
Ramos had agreed in the partition they made of his prop­erties to give one-half
(1/2) of the land in question to the plaintiffs and the other 1/2 to the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Ramos, when in fact the agreement <span style="">was </span>to give the whole parcel to the
said defendant, as it clearly appears in the documentary evidence, Exhibit 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) In declaring that defendant <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span>
Ramos agreed to register 1/2 of said land in question in a registration case in
favor of the plaintiffs, and ordering the defendants, as a consequence thereof,
to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> this 1/2 portion to the plaintiffs and to
pay to them damages and attorney's <span style="">fees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(3) In giving credit to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span> de <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> de Guzman
that the promissory note, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> K, for <span style="">P1<span class="GramE">,<span style="">342.00</span></span></span> was for payment of her children's alleged
1/2 share of the expenses for the survey and registration of said land and for
its conversion into a fishpond.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" (</span>4) In not dismissing the complaint
and in not ordering the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants a reason­able
amount of attorney's fees."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the foregoing assignment of errors, the defendants-appellants
stated in their brief that the only remaining issue is "whether or not the
defendants committed a breach of trust in registering the land in ques­tion
entirely in their names."</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the Court of Appeals defined the nature of the
ac­tion, narrated the factual background of the case and, without mentioning
Exhibit 1, which was referred to in the first assignment of error, resolved the
particular issue, <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>, by stating that
"the findings of the trial court are substantially in accordance with the
evidence and we agree in <span class="GramE">the</span> same" and,
thereafter, quoted about two (2) pages of the trial court's decision that had a
bearing on the said issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' dissatisfaction over the appellate court's
decision lies in their belief that, as nothing <span style="">was </span>said about Exhibit 1 in the
decision, the court did not at all consider the document in weighing the evi­dence,
and, for such failure, they claim that the Court of Appeals failed to perform
its duty under Section 33 of the Judiciary Act (<u>ante</u>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issue in the appeal was defined by the petitioners themselves, and,
on their own definition, the Court of Appeals resolved the issue by confirming
the findings of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellate court need not expressly state in its decision that exhibit 1 does
not suffice to overcome the verbal testimony of the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
wit­nesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And its giving credence to
the latter necessarily implies a re­fusal to accord to <span class="GramE">said</span>
Exhibit the importance and probative value claimed for it by <span style="">defendants
appellants, </span>petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Note that even Section 33 of the Judiciary Act does not impose on
the Court of Appeals the duty of stating complete findings of fact on all
assigned errors, but merely on all <u>issues</u> properly raised before the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the said court
did just what was called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
have been much better, of course, for that Court to have expressly stated its
opinion on the probative value of the Exhibit, but failure to do so is not a
violation of the Judiciary Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the merits, Exhibit 1 does not help petitioners' case to
constitute the failure to mention it a reversible error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The copy of Exhibit 1, which <span style="">was </span>attached
to the instant petition for review, does not say or imply that it is a deed of
partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is just a tabulation of
properties with horizontal dividing lines, and sets the names of indivi­dual
heirs after a summary and sketchy description of certain proper­ties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it was signed, it was undated, and
the signatures appear at the upper right-hand corner, at the end of a list of
properties which are <u>not</u> involved in the present case. Nor is there
anything in it to indicate whether the heirs' names set opposite each property
represents the <span class="SpellE">distributees</span> or the actual possessors
merely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing alone as <span class="GramE">a documentary</span> evidence, Exhibit 1 is not a deed of
partition; hence, the trial and appellate courts were justified in not relying
upon it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding no reversible error in the decision of the Court of
Appeals, the same is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioners.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
