				<H3>REV. FR. CASIMIRO LLADOC, PETITIONER, VS. THE COMMISIONER OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE AND THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime in 1957, the M.B. Estate, Inc., of Bacolod City, donated P10,000.00 
in cash to Rev. Fr. Crispin Ruiz, then parish priest of Victorias, Negros 
Occidental, and predecessor of herein petitioner, for the construction of a new 
Catholic Church in the locality. The total amount was actually spent for the 
purpose intended.
<p>On March 3, 1958, the donor M.B. Estate, Inc., filed the donor's gift tax 
return. Under date of April 29, 1960, the respondent Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue issued V an assessment for donee's gift tax against the Catholic Parish 
of Victorias, Negros Occidental, of which petitioner was the priest. The tax 
amounted to P1,370.00 including surcharges, interests of 1% monthly from May 15, 
1958 to June 15, 1960, and the compromise for the late filing of the return.</p>
<p>Petitioner lodged a protest to the assessment and requested the withdrawal 
thereof. The protest and the motion for reconsideration presented to the 
Commissioner , of Internal Revenue were denied. The petitioner appealed to the 
Court of Tax Appeals on November 2, 1960. In the petition for Review, the Rev. 
Pr. Caslmiro Lladoc, claimed among others, that at the time of the donation, he 
was not the parish priest in Victorias; that there is no legal entity or 
juridical person known as the "Catholic Parish Priest of Victorias," and 
therefore, he should not be liable for the donee's gift tax. It was also 
asserted that the assessment of the gift tax, even against the Roman Catholic 
Church, would not be valid, for such would be a clear violation of the 
provisions of the Constitution.</p>
<p>After hearing, the CTA rendered judgment, the pertinent portions of which are 
quoted below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. Parish priests of the Roman Catholic Church under canon laws are 
similarly situated as its Archbishops and Bishops with respect to the properties 
of the church within their parish. They are the guardians, superintendents or 
administrators of these properties, with the right of succession and may sue and 
be sued.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The petitioner impugns the fairness of the assessment with the argument that 
he should not be held liable for gift taxes on donation which he did not receive 
personally since he was not yet the parish priest of Victorias in the year 1957 
when said donation was given. It is intimated that if someone has to pay at all, 
it should be petitioner's predecessor, the Rev. Fr. Crispin Ruiz, who received 
the donation in behalf of the Catholic parish of Victorias or the Roman Catholic 
Church. Following petitioner's line of thinking, we would be equally unfair to 
hold that the assessment now in question should have been addressed to, and 
collected from the Rev. Fr. Crispin Ruiz to be paid from income derived from his 
present parish wherever it may be. It does not seem right to indirectly burden 
the present parishioners of Rev. Fr. Ruiz for donee's gift tax on a donation to 
which they were not benefited.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We saw no legal basis then as we see none now, to include within the 
Constitutional exemption, taxes which partake of the nature of an excise upon 
the use made of the properties or ). upon the exercise of the privilege of 
receiving the properties. (Phipps vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 91 F 
/2d/ 627; 1938, 302 U.S. 742.)</p>
<p>"It is a cardinal rule in taxation that exemptions from payment thereof are 
highly disfavored by law, and the party claiming exemption must justify his 
claim by a clear, positive, or express grant of such privilege by law. 
(Collector vs. Manila Jockey Club, 98 Phil., 670; 53 Off. Gaz. 
3762.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"The phrase "exempt from taxation" as employed in Section-22(3), Article VI 
of-the Constitution of the Philippines, should not be interpreted to mean 
exemption from all kinds of taxes Statutes exempting charitable and religious 
property from taxation should be construed fairly though strictly and in such 
manner as to give effect to the main intent of the lawmakers." (Roman Catholic 
Church vs. Hastings, 5 Phil., 701.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">â€œWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the 
decision of the respondent&nbsp; Commissioner of Internal Revenue appealed from, is 
hereby affirmed except with regard to the imposition of the compromise penalty 
in the amount of P20.00 (Collector of Internal Revenue vs. U.S.T., G. R. No. 
L-11274, Nov. 28, 1958; * * * * *, and the petitioner, the Rev. Fr. Casimiro 
Lladoc is hereby ordered to pay to the respondent the amount of 'P900.00 as 
donee's gift tax, plus the surcharge of five per centum (57.) as ad. valorem 
penalty under Section 119(c) of the Tax Code, and one per centum (1%) monthly 
interest from May 15, 1958 to the date of actual payment. The surcharge of 257a 
provided in Section 120 for failure to file a return may not be imposed as the 
failure to file a return was not due to willful neglect, (* * * * *). No 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The above judgment is now before Us on appeal, petitioner assigning two (2) 
errors allegedly committed by the Tax Court, all of which converge on the 
singular issue of whether or not petitioner should be liable for the assessed 
donee's gift tax on the P10,000.00 donated for the construction of the Victorias 
Parish Church.</p>
<p>Section 22(3), Art. VI of the Constitution of the Philippines, exempts from 
taxation cemeteries, <em>churches</em> and parsonages or convents, appurtenant 
thereto, and all<em> lands</em>, <em>buildings</em>, and improvements used 
exclusively for religious purposes. The exemption is only from the payment of 
taxes assessed on such properties enumerated, as property taxes, as 
contra-distinguished from excise taxes. In the present case, what the Collector 
assessed was a donee's gift tax; the assessment was not on the properties 
themselves. It did not rest upon general ownership; it was an excise upon the 
use made of the properties, upon the exercise of the privilege of receiving the 
properties (Phipps vs. Com. of Int. Rev., 91 F [2d7] 627.) Manifestly, gift tax 
is not within the exempting provisions of the section just mentioned. A gift tax 
is not a property tax, but an excise tax imposed on the transfer of property by 
way of gift <em>inter vivos</em>, the imposition of which on property used 
exclusively for religious purposes, do not constitute an impairment of the 
Constitution. As well observed by the learned respondent Court, the phrase 
"exempt from taxation," as employed in the Constitution (supra) should not be 
interpreted to mean exemption from all kinds of taxes. And there being ip no 
clear, positive or express grant of such privilege by law, in favor of the 
petitioner, the exemption herein must be denied.</p>
<p>The next issue which readily presents itself, in view of petitioner's thesis, 
and Our finding that a tax liability exists, is, who should be called upon to 
pay the gift tax? Petitioner postulates that he should not be liable, because at 
the time of the donation he was not the priest of Victorias. We note the merit 
of the above claim, and in order to put things in their proper light, this 
Court, in its Resolution of March 15, 1965, ordered the parties to show cause 
why the Head of the Diocese to which the parish of Victorias pertains, should 
not be substituted in lieu of petitioner Rev. Fr. Casimiro Lladoc, it appearing 
that the Head of such Diocese is the real party in interest. The Solicitor 
General, in representation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, interposed 
no objection to such a substitution. Counsel for the petitioner did not also 
offer objection thereto.</p>
<p>On April 30, 1965, in a resolution, We ordered the Head of the Diocese to 
present whatever legal issues and/or defenses he might wish to raise, to which 
resolution counsel for petitioner, who also appeared as counsel for the Head 
of the Diocese, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Bacolod, manifested that it was 
submitting itself to the jurisdiction and orders of this Court and that it was 
presenting, by reference, the brief of petitioner Rev. Fr. Casimiro Lladoc, as 
its own and for all purposes.</p>
<p>In view hereof and considering that, as heretofore stated, the assessment at 
bar had been properly made and the imposition of the tax. is not a violation of 
the constitutional provision exempting churches, parsonages or convents, etc. 
(Art. VI, sec. 22[3], Constitution), the Head of the Diocese, to which the 
parish of Victorias pertains, is liable for the payment thereof.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby AFFIRMED, in so far as 
tax liability is concerned; it is MODIFIED, in the sense that petitioner herein 
is not personally liable for the said gift tax, and that the Head of the 
Diocese, herein substitute petitioner, should pay, as he is presently ordered to 
pay, the said gift tax, without special pronouncement as to 
costs.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, 
Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.,</em> and <em>Zaldivar, JJ. </em>concur. </div>
