				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The spouses Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lahora</span> and <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Moralizon</span> brought the
present appeal to this Court from the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> (in Land Reg. Case No. N-86), dismissing their
petition with respect to Lot No. 2228 on the ground of previous registration,
said appellants claiming that the question of the validity of a cer­tificate of
title based on a patent allegedly obtained by fraud can be raised by them in a
land registra­tion proceeding contrary to the ruling of the court <u>a quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that on 26 November 1965 herein appellants
petitioned the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> for
registration of nine (9) parcels of land located in barrio <span class="SpellE">Zaragosa</span>,
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Manay</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, one-half of which having been acquired by appellant <span class="SpellE">Toribia</span> <span class="SpellE">Moralizon</span> allegedly by
inheritance, and the other half by purchase and by continuous, open, public and
adverse possession in the concept of owner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the said parcels of land is identified as Lot No. 2228, plan
SWO-36856, <span class="SpellE">Manay</span> Cadastre.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was opposed by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Dayanghirang</span>,
Jr., who alleged that lands belonging to him and his wife were included in the
application for registration, mentioning specifically Lot No. 2228 which was
said to be already covered by Original Certificate of Title No. P-6055 in the
name of <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Lands also filed an
opposition to the petition, contending that the applicants or their
predecessors-in-interest never had sufficient title over the parcels of land
sought to be registered, nor have they been in open, continuous, and notorious
possession thereof for at least 30 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 June 1967, counsel for the private <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
filed a motion for correction of the number of the certificate of title
covering Lot No. 2228, erroneously referred to as OCT No. P-6055, when it
should properly be OCT No. P-6053.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
likewise prayed in the same motion that the petition be dismissed insofar as it
includes Lot No. 2228, for the reason that said lot was already registered and
titled in the name of <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> wife as of 21 June
1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its order of 18 June 1967,
which was amended on 29 June 1967, the court granted the <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span>
motion and directed the dismissal of the petition as regard Lot No. 2228, on
the ground that it having been previously registered and titled, said parcel of
land can no longer be the subject of adjudication in another proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be recalled that the action filed by
petitioners-appellants in the lower court on 26 November 1965 was for <u>original</u>
registration of certain parcels of land, including Lot No. 2228 of the <span class="SpellE">Manay</span> Cadastre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not here denied by appellants that said Lot No. 2228 was the subject of a
public land grant in favor of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> wife,
and by virtue of which grant or patent Original Certificate of Title No. P-6053
was issued in her name on 21 June 1956.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants, however, try to make a case against the dismissal-order of
the lower court by contending that the patent issued to <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span>
wife was <u>procured by fraud</u>, because appellants, the alleged actual
occupants of the land, were not notified of the application for patent <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and of its adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, according to appellants, since they
were the actual occupants of the property, the government could not have
awarded it to <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> wife, and the patent issued
to the latter, as well as the original certificate of title subsequently
obtained by her, were null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule in this jurisdiction, regarding public land patents and
the character of the certificate of title that may be issued by virtue thereof,
is that where land is granted by the government to a private individual, the
corresponding patent <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is recorded, and the
certificate of title is issued to the grantee; thereafter, the land is
automatically brought within the operation of the Land Registration Act<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
the title issued to the grantee becoming entitled to all the safeguards
provided in Section 38 of the said Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, upon expiration of one year from its issuance, the certificate
of title shall become irrevocable and indefeasible like a certificate issued in
a registration proceeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, Lot No. 2228 was registered and titled in
the name of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>' wife as of <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="6">21 June 1956</st1:date>, nine (9) years earlier.
Clearly, appellants' petition for registration of the same parcel of land on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="11">26 November 1965</st1:date>, on the ground that
the first certificate of title (OCT No. P-6053) covering the said property is a
nullity, can no longer prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Orderly
administration of justice precludes that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2228, of
the <span class="SpellE">Manay</span> Cadastre, should be the subject of two
registration pro­ceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having become
registered land under Act 496, for all legal purposes, by the issuance of the
public land patent and the recording thereof, further registration of the same
would lead to the obviously un­desirable result of two certificates of title
being issued for the same piece of land, even if both certificates should be in
the name of the same person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if they
were to be issued to different persons, the indefeasibility of the first title,
which is the most valued characteristic of <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
titles, would be torn away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, this Court has ruled in <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span> vs. San
Agustin, 43 Phil. 538, that in a cadastral case the court has no jurisdiction
to decree again the registration of land already decreed in an earlier case;
and that a second decree for the same land would be null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, if the patent had been issued
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the registration proceedings,
the situation would be different.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that
there indeed exists a proper case for cancellation of the patent for intrinsic
fraud, the action for review of the decree should have been filed before the
one year period had elapsed.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, the proper party to bring the action would only be the person
prejudiced by the alleged fraudulent act -- the owner and grantor<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>,
and not another applicant or claimant. Furthermore, the relief provided by the
law in such instance may be secured by the aggrieved party, not in another
registration, for land already registered in the name of a person can not be
the subject of another registration<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>,
but in an appropriate action such as one for re conveyance or reversion<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>,
or for damage in case the property has passed into the hands of an innocent
purchaser for value.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regard the complaint against the alleged correction of the
number of the certificate of title covering Lot No. 2228 which was erroneously
stated in the <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span> motion as OCT No. P-6055,
when it should properly be OCT No. P-6053, it appearing that the motion was
intended to rectify a clearly typographical mistake, there is nothing irregular
in the lower court's order granting the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no error in the order appealed from,
the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellants.</p>
