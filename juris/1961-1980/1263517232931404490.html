since the issues raised on appeal are all questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in its Resolution of January 17, 1967
certifying the case as falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court
points out that this appeal is "unique" in the sense that the
appellant purports to be not the original defendant, Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>,
now deceased, nor his heirs, his widow and three daughters of age, substituted
for him upon his death, per the title of this case above, but rather his
counsel of record, Atty. Jesus P. Garcia, who on April 13, 1960, after the
trial court's adverse decision, filed the Notice of Appeal and cash bond on
Appeal as "Attorney for Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>,
deceased" and on the same date filed the Record on Appeal as "Jesus
P. Garcia, In his capacity as officer of the Court and as former counsel of the
deceased. "<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The Record on Appeal and appeal bond were thereafter approved on <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1960</st1:date> by the trial court and
the case forwarded on appeal to the Court of Appeals, and in turn certified to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case originated on January 18, 1956 when plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed this case against defendant Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span> to hold him liable subsidiary as employer for the
death of plaintiff's son, Delano <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span>, as a
result of injuries sustained in a vehicular collision involving said
defendant's driver <span class="SpellE">Rudolfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Giron</span>,
who, was found insolvent after having been convicted and sentenced in a
previous criminal case arising out of said death, to indemnify the victim's
heirs in, the amount of P3,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">An Answer to the complaint was filed in due course by Atty.
Garcia on behalf of defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1956</st1:date>, the case was heard,
without defendant or his counsel being present, and plaintiff presented his
evidence and the case was submitted for deci­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="6" month="6">June
 6,1956</st1:date>, defendant, however, filed a motion for new trial which was
granted by the trial court on <st1:date year="1956" day="9" month="6">June 9,
 1956</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff presented his oral and documentary evidence and was
cross-examined by Atty. Garcia.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The record further shows that on <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="3">March
 19, 1958</st1:date>, Atty. Garcia commenced the presentation of evidence on
behalf of defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He presented
defendant's wife, <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Manil</span>,
who testified that her husband, Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>,
"had no business of his own, because he is sickly" and that she was
the one operating and managing their transportation business of three trucks.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 14, 1958, when the case was scheduled for con­tinuation
of the trial, Atty. Garcia manifested that the original defendant, Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span> had recently died, and the trial court on the same
date directed him to furnish plaintiff's counsel the names of the said
defendant's heirs, so that plaintiff could amend the complaint accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1959</st1:date>, plaintiff's counsel submitted a Motion to Admit the
Amended Complaint attached thereto, furnishing copy of said pleadings to Atty.
Garcia, who acknowledged receipt thereof as "Attorney for the
defendant." The only amendment in the complaint consisted in <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> the widow and heirs of the deceased original
defendant in substitution for him, pursuant to Rule 3, section 17 of the Rules
of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of the said
motion on the same date, the trial court, after noting that there was no
opposition thereto by Atty. Garcia, admitted, the Amended Complaint in its
Order of August 11, 1959, wherein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"(A)s prayed for by counsel for the defendants, defendants are
hereby given fifteen (15) days time within which to file an answer to said
amended complaint."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
No answer to the amended complaint having been filed, the ori­ginal answer
stood as defendants' answer to the amended com­plaint, in accordance With Rule
11, section 3 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case was again set for hearing on <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1960</st1:date> with notice to the parties
through their counsels of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
day before the hearing, on January 27, 1960, Atty. Garcia filed a "Motion
to Withdraw as Counsel", alleging that "the heirs of Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span> have not hired (him) to represent them and
consequently, (his) continued appearance in representation of a dead client
would .be illegal" and asking the trial court "that he be relieved as
coun­sel in the above-entitled case for the reasons stated herein."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was called on the next day, neither defendants nor
Atty. Garcia appeared, and the trial court, noting "defendants' apparent
lack of interest as can be gleaned from the records" con­sidered them to
have renounced their right to appear and present evidence to contest plaintiff's
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not pass upon Atty.
Garcia's Motion to Withdraw as Counsel and proceeded to render judgment in
favor of plaintiff, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which pro­vides
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court pronounces judgment
in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants; and hereby sentences the
def­endants, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiff the amount of
P3,000.00 as indemnity for the death of Delano <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span>,
plus P3,000.00 in concept of moral damages, and the additional sum of P2,000.00
as attorney's fees, as well as the costs of this action."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Garcia's Motion for Reconsideration, based on the same
grounds hereinafter discussed having been denied by the trial court, he filed
the present appeal, and assigns the following errors in his "Brief for
‘Defendant-Appellant’”:-</p>

<blockquote>"First Error:</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>

ERRED IN RENDERING A PREMATURE JUDGMENT IN AN UNFINISHED CASE WHERE THE NEW
DEFENDANTS WERE NOT GIVEN THEIR DAY IN COURT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He prayed therein that the appellate Court render judgment:</p>

equity." (Appellants’ Brief, p. 10)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We hold this "unique" appeal by the counsel of record,
Atty. Jesus P. Garcia, allegedly “in his capacity as officer of the Court and
as former counsel of the deceased Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>” to be
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are two fundamental errors on which Atty. Garcia’s appeal
is premised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>, if he
presents this appeal “in his capacity as officer of the Court and as former
counsel of the deceased Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>”, his appeal
should be thrown out, as not being a party to the case, much less a party in
interest, he has no legal standing whatsoever to prosecute this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>, in filing his Notice of Appeal
and Cash Appeal Bond, he represent­ed himself as "Attorney for Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>, deceased", depositing the sum of P60.00 as
appeal bond "to answer or respond for the costs <u>which then appellate
court may award against the herein defendant-appellant</u>,"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
thus representing anew to the trial Court that he was duly authorized to
present the appeal on behalf of the estate of the original defendant, Victor <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>, deceased, who had earlier been substituted in the
case by his heirs, the widow and three daughters of legal age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court was perfectly correct in
relying upon this representation in accordance with Rule 138, section 21 of the
Rules of Court which provides that "(A)n attorney is presumed to be
properly authorized to represent any case in which he appears x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." This appeal must
accordingly be dealt with as an appeal on behalf of said heirs as
defendants-appellants and not in the unique" concept with which Atty.
Garcia would circumscribe it.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">As to the first error assigned, no
error was committed by the trial court in continuing with the case and handing
down its decision against defendants-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention that said
defendants-appellants, as substituted parties-defendants by vir­tue of their
being the heirs of the deceased original defendant pursuant to the trial
court's Orders of </span><st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="10">October 24,
 1958</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="8">Aug­ust 11, 1959</st1:date>

should have been brought within the Court's juris­diction by summons is
fallacious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the record shows that
Atty. Garcia at the time acknowledged receipt of the Amended Complaint
substituting said defendants-heirs for the deceased original defendant as
“Attorney for the defendants”, presented no opposition thereto, and furthermore
prayed for and was granted by the Court a period of 15 days to file an answer
to the Amended Complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been
duly <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> and having submitted to the Court's
jurisdiction through their counsel, Atty. Garcia, the issuance of a summons was
unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other contention that
"there is even no record showing that these defendants were at all
informed that they had become parties to the above-captioned case”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
is equally fallacious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in
appellants' brief is there an assertion by Atty. Garcia, that, he, as their
attorney of record, and in compliance with his duty as such and as an officer
of the Court, failed or neglected to inform them of the admission of the
Amended Complaint substituting them for the deceased ori­ginal defendant.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Appellants claim in their second
assignment of error that the trial court erred in ignoring the Motions to
Withdraw as Counsel filed by Atty. Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the face of Atty. Garcia's previous representations and appearance as
counsel of record for the substi­tuted defendants, his last-hour motion to
withdraw as counsel and disclaimer that said defendants have hired him to
represent them -- which he filed one day before the date set for resumption of
the hearing came -- too late and was properly ignored by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court could not accept this turn-about on
his mere "say-so." His motion was not verified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the fact that his said motion
carried no notice, in violation of the requirement of Rule 15, section 4 of the
Rules of Court, and could therefore be treated as a "mere scrap of
paper",</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
the said motion was likewise fatally defective in that it carried no notice to
his clients on record, the defendants-appellants, as required by Rule 138,
section 26 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, it is well settled that "(A)n attorney seeking to
withdraw must make an applica­tion to the court, for the relation does not
terminate formally until there is a withdrawal of record; at least so far as
the opposite party is concerned, the relation otherwise continues until the end
of the litigation."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court's ignoring of the last-hour motion and its handing down of its
decision on the day of the hearing, upon the failure of defendants and their
counsel to appear, in spite of their having been duly notified thereof, was in
effect a denial of counsel's application for withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Garcia's unexplained failure to appear
was <span class="SpellE">unexcusable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had no right to presume that the Court would grant his
withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he had then appeared and
insisted on his withdrawal, the trial court could then have had the opportunity
to order the appearance of defendants-appellants and verify from them the truth
of his assertion that they had not "hired him to represent them."</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court,
therefore, did not render a “premature judgment in an unfinished case where the
defendants were not given their day in court”, as claimed in the last error
assigned by appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated
earlier, the record shows that on March 19, 1958, the original defendant's
widow, <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Manit</span>, was
placed by Atty. Garcia on the witness stand during the deceased's lifetime and
testified that her husband "has no business of his own, because he is
sickly" and that she was the one operating and managing their
transportation business of three trucks since as early as 1952, some years
before the filing of the complaint on January 18, 1956.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In effect, the widow, <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Marnit</span>
had then submitted herself to the Court's jurisdiction, asserting as she did
that she was the one operating the business and that her husband had no
business of his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow and her
three children of age as heirs of the de­ceased cannot therefore claim
ignorance of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, and that
notwithstanding that she was the actual operator and manager of the business,
that she has been kept in complete ignorance of its subsequent developments
after her husband's death over 10 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Almost 10 years have elapsed since they were substituted in 1959 as
defendants for the deceased, and it taxes all credibility for them to claim now
in their brief that "said new defendants did not even know that they
became parties in the Amended Complaint,"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and that all this time, not the slightest effort was made by them to find out
from Atty. Garcia or from the Court for that matter what had happened to the
case nor did Atty. Garcia in compliance with his duty as an officer of the
Court inform them of the decision handed down by the Court over 9 years
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having failed to appear on the day
set for trial without any justifiable explanation to the Court nor having
presented an affi­davit of merits as to the existence of valid and lawful
defenses, they cannot now complain of having been deprived of their day in
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances of the case and the appeal taken all toge­ther
lead to the conclusion that the last-hour withdrawal applica­tion of Atty.
Garcia and his appeal "as officer of the Court and then counsel of the
deceased" was but a device to prolong this case and delay the execution of
the judgment, which should have been carried out years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imposition of double costs is therefore
in order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby
affirmed, with double costs to be paid by the attorney for defendants.</p>
