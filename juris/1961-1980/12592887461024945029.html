				<H3>CASINO ESPAÑOL DE MANILA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND MAMERTO FERIA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><p>Respondent Mamerto Feria was employed as a cook by herein petitioner Casino 
Español de Manila from February 2, 1952 up to November 10, 1958 when he was 
suspended and subsequently dismissed by the petitioner. Whereupon on July 8, 
1959, Feria filed with the Court of Industrial Relations a petition praying for 
his reinstatement with back wages from the time of his dismissal; for the 
payment of unpaid services rendered on Sundays and legal holidays; for payment 
of differential pay for services rendered at night in the sum to be determined 
by the Court; plus attorney's fees. Herein petitioner (respondent below), in its 
answer, denied the factual basis of Feria's claims and specially contended that 
the CIR had no jurisdiction to try the case against it on the ground that it is 
a non-stock corporation organized, not for profit and gain but to promote a 
closer relationship among the Spanish residents in these Islands and to foster 
the development of their interests; to afford recreation and entertainment to 
the members thereof, and to assist the latter in any manner allowable under its 
Articles of Incorporation.</p>
<p>After the trial on the merits, the respondent court rendered a decision 
ordering herein petitioner to pay to Feria an additional compensation of 25% for 
the services rendered on Sundays and legal holidays and for service rendered at 
night from February 2, 1952 up to November 10, 1958. The respondent court did 
not, however, pass upon the prayer for reinstatement. After the denial of the 
motion for reconsideration, the petitioner appealed to this Court by certiorart 
upon the sole issue of the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the CIR Co take 
cognizance of the case. It is already a settled matter which need not be further 
discussed—and the petitioner does not dispute—that the Court of Industrial 
Relations has jurisdiction, among others, over cases involving hours of 
employment under the 8-Hour- labor law and claims arising thereunder by an 
employee or an ex-employee seeking reinstatement (Paflu v. Tan, L-9115, August 
31, 1956; National Shipyard &amp; Steel Corporation v. Almin, et al., L-9055, 
November 28, 1958; Prisco v. CIR, L-13806, May 23, 1960). What, in effect, is 
the point raised in this proceeding is that there is no cause of action against 
petitioner because the law (Com. Act 444) is not applicable to it, it not being 
engaged, it is contended, in any industry or occupation mentioned in Section 2 
of the law.</p>
<p>The provisions of Commonwealth Act 444, pertinent to the present controversy, 
are Sections 2 and 4 thereof which read respectively as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"x x x x </p>
<p>"Sec. 2. This Act shall apply to all persons <em>employed in any industry or 
occupation</em>, whether public or private, with the exception of farm laborers, 
laborers wno prefer to be paid on piece work basis, domestic servants and 
persons xn the personal service of another and members of the family of the 
employer working for him.</p>
<p>"Sec. 4. No person, firm, or corporation, business establishment or place or 
center of labor <em>shall compel an employee or laborer</em> to work during 
Sunday's and legal holidays, unless he is paid an additional sum of at least 
twenty-five <em>per centum</em> of his regular remuneration: PROVIDED HOWEVER, 
That this prohibition shall not apply to public utilities performing some public 
service such as supplying gas, electricity, power, water, or providing means of 
transportation or communication, xxx x." (Italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>It is to be noted that Section 2 refers to the "persons employed", that is, 
<em>the employee</em> or the person who performs the labor. Section 4 refers to 
the e<em>mployer</em>. that is the person or entity that engages or employs the 
laborer. Therefore, the phrase contained in Section 2—"employed in any industry 
or occupation—does not refer to the employer but to the employee, that is, the 
person who works either in an industry or in an occupation.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, Section 4 refers to "person, firm or corporation, 
business establishment or place of center of labor." This section does not 
require that the (employee)"or the one giving the work or requiring the labor, 
should <em>engage</em> in an industry. It is enough that he be the one in whose 
favor labor or work is rendered.</p>
<p>The respondent Feria in the present case is a person included in Section 2, 
because he is employed in his occupation as cook and, therefore, Section: 2 is 
applicable to and protects him. On the other hand, petitioner Casino Espartol de 
Manila is the "place of labor" or the place where respondent Feria renders his 
labor in pursuance of his occupation as cook. Clearly, petitioner is within the 
purview of Section 4. Note that this section does not limit the "person, firm, 
Jor corporation or place or center of labor" only to business enterprises 
established for gain or profit. The law, both in its letter and in its spirit 
and purpose, does not make such a distinction, and no justification is suggested 
for us to make one. Under the circumstances, it seems clear that herein 
respondent Feria, who is covered by Section 2 of the 8-Hour-Labor Law, has a 
cause of action against the petitioner which is not exempt under the provisions 
of Section 4 thereof.</p>
<p>It is claimed, however, that petitioner Casino Español de Manila, being a 
non-stock corporation not established for profit or gain, the Court of 
Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction to entertain the action brought against 
it by respondent Feria, citing the cases of U.S.T. Hospital Employees 
Association v. Sto. Tomas University Hospital (L-6988, March 24, 1954); San Beda 
College v. Court of Industrial Relations (L-7649, Oct. 29, 1955); Quezon 
Institute v. Velasco and Parazo (L-1742 &amp; L-7743, Nov. 23, 1955); Marcelo v. 
Philippine National Red Cross (L-9448, May 28, 1957); Boy Scouts of the 
Philippines v. Araos (L-10091, Jan. 29, 1958); and University of San Agustin v. 
Court of Industrial llelatinns (L-12222, May 28, 1958). Whatever rulings or 
statement may have been rendered or said in the aforecited cases, however, can 
not be invoked herein or made applicable to the case at bar.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that, as previously declared, the issue involved in 
this proceeding is whether there exists a <em>cause of action</em> against the 
petitioners, in connection with the demands of respondent Feria for additional 
compensation under Commonwealth Act 444.</p>
<p>The<em> U.S.T. Hospital Employees</em> case, <em>supra</em>, was decided on 
the question of <em>jurisdiction</em> of the Court of Industrial Relations over 
the dispute presented before it, taking into account the nature of the 
petitioners' (workers) employment in the light of the definition given in 
Section 39-(d) of Republic Act 772 (Workmen's Compensation Act). The 
jurisdiction of the Industrial Court under Commonwealth Act 103, was again the 
issue resolved in the case of <em>San Beda College vs. CIR</em>, <em>supra</em>. 
In both instances, the character or nature of the occupation to which the 
employers were engaged, i.e., caring for the sick and maintaining or providing 
education for young men, respectively, were of considerable weight. The elevated 
and lofty purpose for which the Philippine National Red Cross was established 
and dedicated was also the main reason that moved this Court into holding the 
said institution exempted from liability, in the <em>Marcelo</em> case. In the 
<em>Boy Scouts of the Philippines</em> and <em>University of San Agustin</em> 
cases, aside from being litigated on a different ground (unfair labor practice), 
the fact that their organization and maintenance are for the education and 
instruction of, the encouragement, development and promotion of character and 
patriotism in, the youth of the land, underscored and <em>rationale</em> of 
those decisions.</p>
<p>The same thing can not be said of herein petitioner. True it may be that it 
is a non-stock corporation not organized for profit or gain, yet it can not be 
contended that petitioner's operations, aimed at providing service, comfort and 
benefit only to its members and their guests, give to such undertaking the 
benevolent or lofty nature, characteristic of those treated in the cited cases. 
And it can not be doubted that upon dissolution or termination of the existence 
of this club, whatever profits it may have accumulated will redound to the 
benefit of its members.</p>
<p><strong>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</strong>, the decision appealed from is 
hereby affirmed, without costs.</p>
<p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong> </p>
