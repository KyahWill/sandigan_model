judgment was rendered in the above-entitled case, a copy of which was served
upon and received by petitioners on July 28 of the same year. On August 22,
they filed a motion for recon­sideration in connection with which, by our
resolution of August 25 of the same year, they were granted leave to file a
supporting memorandum. On <st1:date month="9" day="2" year="1967">September 2,
 1967</st1:date>, they filed SUPPLEMENTAL ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION which ended praying "that the decision promulgated on <st1:date month="7" day="13" year="1967">July 13, 1967</st1:date> in this case be set
aside".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="2" year="1967">September 2, 1967</st1:date>,
the respondents filed a written opposition to the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="9">September <span style="">8, </span>1967</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span> passed a resolution denying, among others, the
reconsideration prayed for <span style="">in the
abovementioned Supplemental Arguments in Support of the Motion for
Reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="13" year="1967"><span style="">October
 13, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> entry of

<p class="BODY">But on <st1:date month="4" day="23" year="1968">April 23, 1968</st1:date>,
petitioners filed another motion for reconsideration claiming that the decision
rendered in the case was not in accordance with settled jurisprudence on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion <span class="GramE">We</span>
denied on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May 3, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">,
for the reason that final judgment had already been entered in the case on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="10"><span style="">October

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="27" year="1968">June 27, 1968</st1:date>,
petitioners again came with a motion for reconsideration claiming (a) that <span style="">there is as yet no resolution on </span>the
basic motion for reconsideration and that, therefore, the entry of judgment was
premature, null and void, and that (b) their motion for reconsideration
(presumably <span class="GramE">the</span> last) was meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find no merit in
petitioners' contention that their basic motion for reconsideration has not yet
been resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated heretofore, in
their supplemental arguments in support of their basic motion for recon­sideration,
they prayed precisely that our decision of <st1:date month="7" day="13" year="1967">July 13, 1967</st1:date> be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what <span class="GramE">We</span>
denied, inter <span class="SpellE"><span style="">alia</span></span><span style="">, </span>by our resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1967</st1:date>, a copy of which was
received by petitioners' counsel on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="10">October
 6, 1967</st1:date>. It is, therefore, clear that the decision of this court had
already become <span style="">final </span>and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> when the entry of judgment was made.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,</b> the last motion for
reconsideration filed by petitioner‘s on July 27 1968 c<span style="">an </span><span style="">no longer be
