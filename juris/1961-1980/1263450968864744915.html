				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Direct appeal on points of law from a decision of the Court of First
Instance of Baguio, in its Case No. 1346.</p>

<p class="BODY">For having paid, out of city funds, various treasury warrants
and/or checks which turned out to have been forged, causing loss to the city in
the total amount of <span style="">P8,750.48, </span>Roman
D. Abellera, cashier in the office of the City Treasurer of Baguio, <span style="">was </span>charged administratively on
January 18, 1960 for "Dishonesty and Gross Negligence in the Performance
of Official Duties" (Case No. R-22111).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the lapse of the period of preventive suspension, he <span style="">was automatically </span>reinstated to the
service on May 24, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 6, 1961, the
Commissioner of Civil Service found him guilty </span>as charged and considered
said respondent "resigned effective the date fol­<span style="">lowing his last </span><span style="">day of </span><span style="">duty with </span>prejudice
to reinstatement in positions In­volving money <span style="">and/or </span>property responsibility".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the <span style="">foregoing decision, Abellera was </span>dismissed on July 10, 1961, and
the position of cashier <span style="">was filled in
by one </span>Francisco Rillera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime, upon denial by the Commissioner of his motion for new trial, Abellera
appealed to the Civil <span style="">Service </span>Board
of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 25, 1963, the Civil Service Board of Appeals modified
the ruling of the Commissioner of Civil Service by reducing the penalty imposed
on the employee to two months suspension, without pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other­wise, the decision of the Commissioner
was affirmed in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After some <span style="">delay </span>attending
the exchange of communication between the City Treasurer of Baguio and the
Civil Service Commissioner, Abellera was finally <span style="">allowed </span>to report for <span style="">work
on </span>November 11, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 17, 1963, however, alleging that he has not been
reinstated to his former position of cashier, but <span style="">was </span>only required to do work other than that of a cashier, and
that he has not been paid any salary, including the back salaries due him from
July 10, 1961, Abellera filed an action for mandamus in the Court <span style="">of First </span>Instance of Baguio against
the City of Baguio, the City Council, the City Auditor, and the City Treasurer,
the latter being sued both in his official as well as his personal capacities;
seeking for his re­<span style="">instatement to the </span>position
of city cashier with back salaries from July 10, 1961; for <span style="">moral damages in </span>the sum of P5,000.00;
exemplary damages for P5,000.00; <span style="">attorneys'
fees in </span>the sum of P1,500.00 and 20% of the recover­able <span style="">salaries, </span>plus costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their answer, </span>respondents
contended that petitioner <span style="">was </span>not
re­instated as cashier due to the cancellation of his bond; that said
cancellation of bond <span style="">was </span>recommended
by the City Treasurer following the ruling in the <span style="">administrative </span>case, finding petitioner <span style="">negligent </span>in his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was also <span style="">alleged </span>that petitioner
was offered the position of <span style="">Special
Deputy</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>with compensation at P3, 960.00 per
annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent City Treasurer further
claimed that in refusing to reinstate petitioner to the position of cashier, he
had in mind only the best interest of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The par­ties thereafter submitted the <span style="">case </span>for judgment on the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of June 8, 1964, the lower court declared that
the action of the City Treasurer in not giving petitioner the work of a cashier
<span style="">was </span>justified by the decision of
the Civil Service Board of Appeals, reduc­ing merely the penalty by providing a
2 months suspension, but otherwise affirming the decision of the Commissioner
of Civil Service in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the respondents were ordered to pay Abellera's salary from <span style="">the </span>date of his suspension on July 10,
1961 until November 10, 1963, deduct­ing therefrom the 2 months pay corresponding
to the penalty imposed by <span style="">the </span><span style="">Civil Service </span>Board of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents were also directed to reinstate
him to a position in the service of the city government with sal­ary at P330.00
a month, but which will not involve the custody of funds and/or <span style="">property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The court did not award any damages, because no bad faith can be
attributed to anyone, including the City Treasurer, and also because municipal
corporations cannot be held civilly <span style="">liable
</span>for the mis­feasance or malfeasance of any of its officers or
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties appealed to this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants City of Baguio
and its officials assail the correctness of the award of back salaries to
petitioner from July 10, 1961 to November </span>10, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
claimed that since petitioner </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">found
guilty of negli­gence by the </span>Civil <span style="">Service
Board of Appeals although the penalty originally imposed by the Commissioner of
Civil Service was reduced to only 2 months suspension, his (Abellera's)
suspension from the service cannot be cons­idered unjustified to entitle him to
payment of the salaries during the pe­riod in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also contended that such payment of
back salaries </span>is <span style="">discretionary
in the proper department head, in this case, the Secretary </span>of <span style="">Finance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, petitioner as appellant claims that the lower court
erred in not ordering the respondents, particularly the City Treasurer, </span>to
<span style="">pay him damages and in not ordering his
reinstatement to the position of cashier in the office of the City Treasurer of
Baguio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule on payment of back salaries during the period of suspen­sion
of a member of the civil service who is subsequently ordered reinstated, is
already settled in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such payment of salaries corresponding to the period when an employee is
not allowed to work may be decreed not only if he is found innocent of the
charges which caused his suspension (Sec. 35, Rep. Act 2260), but also when the
suspension is unjustified.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, upon receipt of the decision of the Civil
Service Commissioner finding petitioner-appellant guilty, but even before the
pe­riod to appeal had <span style="">expired, </span>respondents dismissed the latter from the ser­vice and
another one was appointed to replace him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The separation of petitioner before the decision of the Civil Service
Commissioner had be­come final was evidently premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents should have realized that the
employee still had the right to appeal the Commissioner's deci­sion to the
Civil Service Board of Appeals within a specified period, and the <span style="">possibility of that decision being reversed
or modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it did happen, </span>on
<span style="">such appeal by the petitioner, the
penalty imposed by the Commissioner </span>was <span style="">reduced by the reviewing Board </span>to <span style="">only 2 months suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
yet, </span>by respondents' action, petitioner was deprived of work for more
than 2 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, Abellera's second
suspension from office, from July 10, 1961 to <span style="">November 10, 1963, was unjustified</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and the payment of </span>the salaries
corresponding to said period is, consequently, proper.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span> <span style="">Otherwise,
Abellerd, in effect, suffer </span>a suspension longer than that meted him by
the Civil Service Board of <span style="">Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also contended by the respondents-appellants that under its
charter, the City of Baguio is exempted from liability for damages or injuries
caused by the failure of any city officials to enforce any provision of law or
ordinance, or by the negligence of said officials in enforcing or attempting <span style="">to </span>enforce the same (Sec. 2547, Rev.
Adm. Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, this is not an instance
of "failure" of the city officials to take action or
"negligence" in the enforcement of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unjustified action of the respondents
here is not that it was the product of negligence, than of haste or <span style="">overzeal. The exempting provision invoked is
not, </span>therefore, applicable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents-appellants,
likewise, </span>cited <span style="">a </span>1959
ruling of the Auditor General to support their contention that the payment of
back salaries of suspended employees depends upon the discretion of the proper
department head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be pointed out
that the aforecited rul­<span style="">ing, part of
which </span><span style="">was
</span><span style="">quoted in appellants' brief (pp.
13-14), was re</span>ferring to the authority of the <span style="">Civil Service </span>Commissioner to suspend employees pursuant to
Section 695 of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ruling, therefore, must <span style="">have
been based on </span>Section <span style="">260 of the
same Code which provides that when the chief of a bureau or </span>office
suspends a <span style="">subordinate official or
employee, the person suspended shall </span>not re­ceive pay during the
suspension, unless so ordered by the department head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span style="">provisions
of the Revised Administrative </span>Code, however, are deemed to <span style="">have been superseded </span>by Republic Act
2260 (Revised Civil Service Act), which contained <span style="">provisions on Discipline of government officials and employees (Chapter
VII), and on preventive suspension (Sec. 35).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, under this later legislation, the authorization of the department
head </span>is no longer necessary before back salaries may be paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to the petitioner-appellant' s assignment of error, we
have to sustain the ruling of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that there <span style="">is no
question that by petitioner's act, which was </span>found <span style="">even by the Civil Service </span>Board of
Appeals to be negligent, the city lost the amount of P8,750.48, his dismissal
by the respondent city officials cannot entirely be attributed to malice or bad
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of positive
showing to the contrary, we have to accept respondents' explanation that the
action complained of <span style="">was </span>prompted
by their belief that it was being done for the best interest of the city
government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view </span>of the
foregoing considerations, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with
costs against respondents-appellants.</p>
