				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The records disclose that on <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1957</st1:date>, respondent Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span>
<span class="SpellE">Keng</span> filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a petition for naturalization docketed as Case No.
308.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1959</st1:date>, respondent trial Judge rendered a
decision on the merits admitting him to Philippine citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February l5, 1961, after due hearing,
respondent trial Judge issued an order allowing respondent Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> to take his oath of
allegiance as a Filipino citizen and directing the issuance of the
corresponding certificate of naturalization in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1961</st1:date>, respondent Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> took his oath of allegiance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 11, 1962, the petitioner Republic of the Philippines
through the Solicitor General filed a motion in the same case before the same
court praying that the decision dated January 31, 1959 granting the petition
for naturalization of respondent Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span>, and the order dated February 15, 1961 allowing
respondent Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> to
take his oath of allegiance, be declared null and void and the certificate of
naturalization issued pursuant thereto as well as its registration in the Civil
Registry be cancelled, on the grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the naturalization certificate of Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> was obtained illegally
and/or through fraud consisting of the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) petitioner's misrepresentation that he
was a resident of <span class="SpellE">Tenejeros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> at the time of, and at least one year immediately
before he filed his petition for naturalization when in truth and in fact he
had never resided in the said place, his evident purpose being to mislead this
Honorable Court to give due course to his petition; (2) He and his lawyer's act
of offering in evidence a certificate of change of residence purporting to show
that petitioner transferred his residence from 846 <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>,
Manila to <span class="SpellE">Tenejeros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> effective May 24, 1956, in order to support the
false allegation in the petition that petitioner was a resident of <span class="SpellE">Tenejeros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, when in fact he was not; and a medical certificate
which states that petitioner was personally examined by Dr. Evelyn T. Perez and
found not to be suffering from any incurable and contagious diseases when the
said doctor could not have performed the examination or subscribed and sworn to
the certificate before the notary public because she was abroad at the time;
(3) Alleging in his petition and making it appear that his three alleged
children were studying at the Dr. <span class="SpellE">Kwangson</span> Young
Memorial School at the time he filed his petition on November 20, 1957, when in
truth and in fact his children arrived only on September 12, 1958 for a three
month's temporary stay, petitioner's evident purpose being to deceive this
Honorable Court and make it believe that petitioner is exempt from the filing
of a declaration of intention; (4) Falsely alleging that he has all the
qualifications and none of the disqualifications of an applicant for Philippine
citizenship when he was not qualified to become a Filipino citizen at the time
of the petition;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this Honorable Court has never acquired
jurisdiction to hear the above-entitled petition, petitioner Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> not being a resident of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> province at the time of and at least one year
immediately preceding the filing of his petition;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the failure to file a declaration of
intention is fatal to the application for naturalization unless petitioner is
exempt which is not the case under consideration (<span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Yap vs. Republic, G.R. No. L-4270, <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="5">May

L-4112, <st1:date year="1952" day="28" month="8">Aug. 28, 1952</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the grounds for cancellation of a
certificate of naturalization is 'if the petition was made on an invalid
declaration of intention' (Sec. 18, par. (c), Commonwealth Act No. 473, as
amended)." (pp. 30-31, rec.; pp. 15-16, rec. on appeal.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the aforesaid motion for denaturalization was
amplified by a memorandum filed on December 9, 1963 by the Solicitor General
(pp. 32-40, rec.; pp. 17-25, rec. on appeal), in opposition to which respondent
Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span> filed on
January 15, 1964 his memorandum (pp. 41-48, rec.; pp. 26-33, rec. on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 13, 1964, petitioner Republic of the Philippines
received through the Solicitor General the resolution of the respondent trial
Judge dated March 30, 1964, denying the motion of the Solicitor General for the
nullification of the decision dated January 31, 1959 and the cancellation of
the certificate of naturalization of respondent Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span>
<span class="SpellE">Keng</span> as well as its registration in the Civil
Registry (pp. 48-51, rec.; pp. 33-36, rec. on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1964</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a notice of appeal from the aforesaid resolution of the
respondent trial Judge dated <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="3">March 30,
 1964</st1:date> (p. 51, rec.; p. 36, rec. on appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="5">May
 7, 1964</st1:date>, petitioner filed a motion for the approval of the record
on appeal (p. 52, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1964</st1:date>,
respondent trial Judge issued an order dismissing the appeal interposed by the
Solicitor General on the ground that, in line with his opinion in the case of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> To, No. 326<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
there is no statutory provision conferring the right to appeal from any
resolution of the court in a denaturalization proceeding (Annex "B",
p. 53, rec.).</p>

of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
now files this petition for <i style="">mandamus</i>

the respondent trial Judge's order of <st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="5">May
 19, 1964</st1:date>, to command respondent Judge to approve petitioner's
record on appeal, and to compel the elevation of said record on appeal together
with the original record and testimonial as well as documentary evidence
submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well settled is the principle that the judgment directing the
issuance of the certificate of naturalization is a mere grant of a political
privilege by the government to an alien applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally well imbedded is the rule that
neither <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> nor <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> may be set up to bar the State from initiating
appropriate proceedings for the cancellation or nullification of the
certificate of naturalization thus issued.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question as to whether the State can appeal from an order or
decision denying its petition for denaturalization, was squarely and
categorically answered in the affirmative by the Supreme Court in Republic vs.
Reyes, et <span style="">al.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This Tribunal, thru Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Sanchez, in
nullifying the order of respondent trial Judge, ruled in said case thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Adverting to the opinion below, we repeat that denial of the
appeal was predicated solely upon the view that since Section 11 providing for
appeals is placed well ahead of Section 18 giving the grounds for the cancellation
of a certificate of naturalization, said Section 11 does not apply to the
cancellation of a naturalization certificate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 11 of the Naturalization Law reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'Sec. 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal - The
final sentence may, at the instance of either of the parties, be appealed to
the Supreme Court.'</p>

<blockquote>"That a decision denying the State's right to cancellation of
a naturalization certificate is a final sentence, need not be essayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision disposed of the conflicting
claims of the Republic on one hand and the naturalized citizen on the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing more need be done in the
trial court with respect to the merits of the controversy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The happenstance that Section 11 providing for appeals was
placed immediately after Section 10 (which deals with the judgment upon an
application for naturalization) and is way ahead of Section 18 (which refers to
a decision on the question of the cancellation of a naturalization
certificate), does not mean that appeal may be had only from a decision on a
naturalization application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The language
in Section 11 does not limit appeals to a decision on an application for
citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It speaks of final sentence
in general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely enough, a decision on
denaturalization proceedings is also a final sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to take the thought conveyed by the
statute as a whole; construe the constituent parts together; ascertain the
legislative intent from the whole act; consider each and every provision
thereof in the light of the general purpose of the statute; and endeavor to
make every part effective, harmonious, sensible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus combining the diverse parts of the
Naturalization Law with the obvious legislative intent, i.e., to give the State
ample opportunity to make effective its statutory right to withdraw the
privilege of citizenship theretofore granted, we find ourselves unable to
discern, in the placement of Section <span style="">11,
</span>a legislative intent to deny the government's right to appeal under
Section 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The implication that
"final sentence" may "be appealed" in Section 11 includes
an appeal from a final sentence under Section 18, is so strong that the
contrary theory cannot reasonably be supposed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Besides, a common sense approach to statutory interpretation
deserves consideration here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a
decision granting naturalization by a lower court may be the subject of review
by this Court, equal reason there is to say that a decision denying the State's
right to withdraw such privilege may likewise be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If because of fallibility <span style="">a </span>judgment of the Court of First
Instance in the first case may be corrected, certainly the stamp of
infallibility cannot be placed upon <span style="">a </span>decision
of the same court in the second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this because denaturalization proceedings are infused with public interest, and
the State should not be rendered helpless in the legitimate exercise of its
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, to effectively shackle
the hands of the State from appealing a decision under Section 18 may well, in
the long run, import a situation whereby the government is rendered impotent to
withdraw the privilege of citizenship to an alien unworthy thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We reaffirm the wisdom and validity of the foregoing
pronouncement.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the said case of Republic vs. Reyes, as early as
1932, the Supreme Court had occasion to pass upon an analogous question in the
case of Bell vs. Attorney General<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Supreme Tribunal sustained the right of an alien to appeal from an
order or judgment directing the cancellation of his naturalization
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no justification
to deny the State the same right to appeal from an order or decision dismissing
its petition for denaturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of respondent trial Judge of May 19,
1964 dismissing the appeal interposed by the petitioner Republic of the
Philippines is hereby set aside; and the respondent trial Judge or his successor
is hereby directed to give due course to the appeal and to elevate the same
together with the original record as well as the testimonial and the
documentary evidence, and to approve the record on appeal, with costs against
respondent Lim <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span>.</p>
