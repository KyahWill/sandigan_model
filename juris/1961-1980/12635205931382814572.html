				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>mandamus</i>, filed by the Heirs of
Juan D. Francisco, to compel the respondent Judge of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to approve their appeal from the
order of said court dated <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="9">14 September
 1967</st1:date>, in Civil Case No. 3796.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as may be pertinent to the present proceeding, the facts
of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 September 1955, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> San
Miguel filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
against Juan D. Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> D. Francisco,
praying for the liquidation of the partnership of Francisco, San Miguel &amp;
Co. (composed of himself and the defendants), for partition of the properties
thereof, and for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due
proceedings, and upon the findings that the partnership was the actual owner of
the "La <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> Estate", composed of 2
lots with a total area of 510,904 square meters and covered by TCT No. 26774 in
the name of Juan D. Francisco; that by common agreement each partner acquired
for himself, by purchase, a 5-hectare lot, the lots to be taken from the
estate; and that the cash contributions to the partnership were P2,484.23, by
Juan D. <span class="SpellE">Fancisco</span>, P1,631.12, by <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
San Miguel, and P778.00, by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> D. Francisco,
the court rendered decision on 29 December 1958, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Court hereby renders judgment in
favor of the plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> San Miguel, end
declares the properties covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 26774 as
common property of the partnership 'Francisco, San Miguel and Co.' and the
five-hectare lot now possessed by <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> San Miguel
as the exclusive property of the latter and pursuant to this judgment, this Court
orders the defendant, Juan D. Francisco, as manager of the 'Francisco, San
Miguel and Co.':</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"(1)<span style=""> </span>To wind up and liquidate the affairs of the
partnership within 30 days from finality of this Judgment;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"(2)<span style=""> </span>To partition the properties covered by the
above-mentioned Title between the partners in proportion to their respective
interests in the partnership and submit to this Court the project of partition
for its approval within the same period of time, provided, however, that the
five-hectare lot now presently occupied and possessed by plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> San Miguel, shall be excluded from said partition
and the other five-hectare lots owned exclusively by the other partners; and</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"(3)<span style=""> </span>to indemnify the plaintiff by way of attorney's
fees in the sum of P1,000.00, and to pay the costs.”</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Appealed to the Court of Appeals, the
decision was affirmed on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="11">14 November
 1962</st1:date>, the appellate court remanding the case to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="2">27 February 1963</st1:date>,
with the decision having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> San Miguel applied to the court for authority to
wind up and liquidate the affairs of the partnership and effect a partition of
the properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was opposed
by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Francisco, who was thereupon appointed by
the court as liquidator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Francisco failed to comply with the directive of
the court within the prescribed period, San Miguel once more prayed the court
for authority to effect the liquidation of the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">31 July 1963</st1:date>, the court granted San Miguel's petition, and
he was authorized to liquidate the partnership and to submit a Project of
Partition in accordance with the decision in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="1">8 January 1964</st1:date>,
San Miguel submitted for approval of the court the required Project of
Partition and report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the plan,
the "La <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> Estate", after the 3 lots
of 5 hectares each were removed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, is to be
divided into 9 lots, Lots 1, 2, and 3, with a total area of 171, 203 square
meters, more or less, to be adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
San Miguel; Lots 7, 8, and 9, with a total area of 230,891 square meters, to
Juan D. Francisco;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and Lots 4, 5 and 6, with a total area of 108,800 square meters, to <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> D. Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also suggested that the expenses for the survey and subdivision
of the property be divided among the partners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The approval of the Project of Partition was opposed by the heirs
of Juan D. Francisco for several reasons:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the division of the only property of the partnership was not in
accordance with the proportionate investments of the partners and with their
agreement; that in his liquidation report San Miguel failed to consider the
amount of P1,555.93, advanced by the deceased Juan D. Francisco for payment of
taxes on the land from 1943 to 1962, as part of the latter's contribution to
the partner­ship, contrary to the directive of the court; that he did not
properly segregate the 5-hectare lots belonging to each partner; that the
sharing proportion used was erroneous; that the division of the property was de­fective
in that, while Juan D. Francisco apparently was given a larger share, Lot No. 9
allocated to him contained part of the provincial road with an area of 11,669
square meters which was not disclosed in the plan; and that, since plan (LRC)
PCS-2810 (Exhibit "B") is erroneous, because it did not indicate the
provincial road traversing Lot 9; and that the total area of said road as
appearing in the plan is smaller than the actual area thereof if plotted
against the map duly approved by the Bureau of Lands in 1935, so that the plan
is worthless and the heirs of Juan D. Francisco should not be required to share
in the expenses for its preparation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of 14 September 1967, the court, taking into account
the respective shares and interests of the partners in the property, and the
physical condition of the lots already occupied by them, declared the
adjudication made in the proposed partition plan fair and just.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, said project of partition was approved,
and the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was ordered to
cancel TCT No. 26774 in the name of Juan D. Fran­cisco, and upon payment of the
corresponding fees, to issue separate titles to <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
San Miguel, for Lots 1, 2 and 3 of plan (LRC) PCS-2810; to <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
D. Francisco, for Lots 4, 5 and 6; and to the heirs of Juan D. Francisco, for
Lots 7, 8, and 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The expenses for the
survey and subdivision of the property were apportioned among the partners in
this manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan D. Francisco, to pay
P930.00; <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> San Miguel, P640.00, and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Francisco P300.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The heirs of Juan D. Francisco were also directed to clear TCT No. 26774
of any mortgage or encumbrance thereon in 10 days from the finality of the
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="10">12 October 1967</st1:date>,
the heirs of Juan D. Francisco filed their appeal bond and notice to appeal
from said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By order of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="2">8 February 1968</st1:date>, however, the appeal
was disapproved by the court on the ground that the partition being in
accordance with the terms of the decision, an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
would be frivolous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When their motion
for reconsideration of this order was denied, the heirs of Juan D. Francisco
instituted the present action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the sole issue in this case is whether or not the
respondent judge was correct in disallowing the appeal from the order approving
the project of partition, which in turn would call for the determination of
whether such an appeal is frivolous or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be well to remember, in this connection, that the fact
that the decision in this case has long become final and executor and that the
order in dispute was issued merely in execution thereof, does not neces­sarily
imply the non-existence of an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while it is true that, as a general rule,
an order of execution of a final judgment is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>,
it is also recognized that the rule is subject to two ex­ceptions, viz., (1)
when the order of execution varies or tends to vary the tenor of the judgment,
and (2) when the terms of the judgment are not clear enough that there remains
room for interpretation thereof by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such instances, appeal is to be allowed to
the party who may feel aggrieved by the order of execution thus issued.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that the decision of 29 December 1958 found that
the “La <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> Estate" belongs to the
partnership composed of Juan D. Francisco, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
San Miguel, and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> D. Francisco; that the res­pective
contributions of the parties, as recapitulated by them in 1947, were placed at
P2,484.23, for Juan D. Francisco, P1,631.12, for <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>
San Miguel, and P778.00 for <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> D. Francisco;
that the parties each acquired a 5-hectare lot from the partnership property;
wherefore, the court below directed Juan D. Francisco, and later, <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> San Miguel, (a) to wind up and liquidate the
affairs of the partnership, and (b) to partition the "La <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> Estate" among the partners, in the
proportion of their interests in the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be seen that the decision left a
number of things still to be done, any of which would involve the use of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, it would be
necessary to deter­mine what properties would be included in the liquidation of
the partnership; what contributions or expenditures made for the estate may be
considered for purposes of determining the interests of the parties therein;
and how the properties of the partnership would be divided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These gaps in the decision gave rise to the
present controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, confronted
with the project of partition submitted by respondent San Miguel, herein petitioners
at once apprised the court below of their objections thereto, as heretofore
recited, raise not just trivial matters but genuine issues that the court below
would have to determine and pass upon, the process requiring its exercise of
discretion and judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when the
said court approved the proposed project of partition, over the objections of
therein defendants that the partition was not in accordance with the final
decision in the case, that order becomes subject to review, and whatever error
may have been committed in arriving thereat is correctible by appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents also raise the question of jurisdiction
of this Court over the present action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is pointed out that at the instance of petitioners, the main decision
in the case was previously appealed to, and affirmed by, the Court of Appeals
in 1962, implying that the matter involved in this action should have been
brought to that tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the
allegation may have some basis, it is equally true that the petition here,
filed on 7 March 1968, contains a statement (footnote, page 1) to the effect
that the properties involved in the case, consisting of 510,000 square meters
of land in <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
are now valued at P1.50 per square meter, or a total of P766,356.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the location and nature of the
properties as they appear in the records, i.e., that they are elevated areas
located along the provincial road, next to an existing subdivision, they
consist of irrigated <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span> and rolling orchards,
the source of water is inside the property making the place suitable for resort
purposes,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and taking judicial notice of the upward trend of the price of real properties,
the valuation of the Estate at P1.50 per square meter in 1968 can not be
considered exorbitant or arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the rule is that, where the jurisdiction of a court is dependent upon the
amount, such amount shall be determined by the facts existing <u>at the time
when the jurisdiction of the court is invoked</u>, which is reckoned to be upon
the filing of the complaint or petition in case of an original action or, in an
appeal, when the appellate tribunal acquires jurisdiction over the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the statement about the market value of the pro­perties was verified
under oath by <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> Francisco<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,
one of the petitioners, and recourse against any <span class="SpellE">perjurious</span>
declaration, if warranted, may be made in a proper proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of this petition, however, the
aforesaid verification suffices as subs­tantial compliance with the Rules then
in force.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither would the allegation that the record on appeal did not
incorporate Annex "B" of respondent San Miguel's Report and Plan of
Subdivision, or that it included therein a letter of one of herein petitioners
to the trial judge, which allegedly is not a pleading, or that he record on
appeal is fraught with errors, justify the orders disapproving the appeal
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The annex mentioned by
respondents (plan of subdi­vision), having been admitted as an exhibit,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
can be incorporated in the record on appeal merely by referring to the exhibit
number or letter by which it was identified during the hearing,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
as herein petitioners had actually done.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
As regard the inclusion in the record of a letter that has no place therein,
and the existence of clerical errors in the record on appeal, they can not be
treated as such serious infractions of the Rules as to deprive appellants of
their right to elevate their cause to the appellate tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, the matters would properly draw an
apposite order from the trial court, after hearing, for amendment or correction
of the record on appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> but
certainly not for the total disallowance of the appeal; unless, of course, it
can be shown (which respondents have not done in this case) that such errors or
deficiencies were purposely sought to delay the early termination of the
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, the order of the lower
court of <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="2">8 February 1968</st1:date> is
hereby set aside, and the writ prayed for is granted, ordering the judge
