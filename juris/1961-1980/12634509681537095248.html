				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original action for prohibition with a prayer for the
issuance of <span style="">a
</span>writ of preliminary injunction filed by <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and others against the Honor­able Mateo <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span> <span style="">as </span>Judge of the Third Branch of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>, and
Amelia, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, for the purpose of
"prohibiting <span style="">res­pondent </span>judge from further proceeding with Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-7646" of his Court.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A supplement to the original petition was subsequently filed by
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the parties on the question of whether a writ of
preliminary injunction should be issued, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>granted the
petition for injunction but making the writ effective only until <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1965</st1:date>, upon the filing
of a bond by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the latter's
motion, however, our resolution on the matter was amended on December 22, 1965
so <span style="">as </span>to
make the preliminary injunction effective until <span style="">a </span>decision on the merits is rendered in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues having been joined with <span style="">the </span>filing of an answer for respondents the <span style="">case was </span>set for hearing but, instead
of arguing the case orally, the parties prayed for and were allowed to submit,
as they did submit written memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar <span style="">is </span>intimately
related with G. R. No. L-18498 entitled "Testate Estate of Vito <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Borromeo</span></span><span style="">, </span>Jose H. <span class="SpellE">Junquera</span>,
Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Crispin <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, et al., <span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span>-Appellants and Republic of the Philippines, <span class="SpellE">Inter­venor</span>-Appellant," in which the lower court,
besides denying probate to a document submitted as the <span style="">last </span>will of the <span style="">deceased
</span>Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, denied <span style="">a </span>motion filed on February 11, 1954 by Tomas, Amelia, and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> for the
exclusion from the inventory of the Estate submitted by the Special Adminis­trator
of thirteen lots or parcels of land mentioned in said motion, claiming that the
same had been sold by Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, during his
lifetime, to the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Arcade, T. L. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> <span style="">y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Said
motion was first denied by the lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1954</st1:date> and was reiterated in the decision
on the merits referred to above.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> and Amelia, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, commenced Civil Case No. R-7646 in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> against Jesus R. <span class="SpellE">Gaboya</span>, Special Administrator of the Estate of the deceased
Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, for the recovery of ownership and
possession of the thirteen lots already mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span style="">issues
</span>had been joined therein, the respondent judge set the case for trial,
but before the trial could be held the defendant filed <span style="">a </span>motion for a preliminary hearing on certain affirmative
defenses averred in his answer and, in effect, asked for the dismissal of the
case on the ground principally that the questions of ownership and right of
possession over the thirteen lots <span class="SpellE">subjectmatter</span> of
the action were already involved in G. R. No. L-18498 - the appeal inter­posed
by both parties from the decision rendered by the same Court in the special
proceeding for the probate of the will of the deceased Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied and, as a result, the
present action for prohibition was instituted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In our decision <span style="">in G.</span>R. No.</span> L-18498 we <span style="">said </span>the follow­ing on the question of whether the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span style="">exercising its jurisdiction </span>as <span style="">a </span>probate court, had authority to determine the question of
ownership in relation to the thirteen lots mentioned heretofore:</p>

<blockquote>"We shall now consider the appeal taken by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> and the Republic of the Philippines from that
portion of the decision where the lower court declined to decide with finality
the question of who owns the thirteen parcels of land <span class="SpellE">subjectmatter</span>
of the confirmatory sale Exhibit F-1 and whether or not they should be included
in or excluded from the in­ventory of properties of the <span style="">Estate </span>of the deceased Vito <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that on February 11, 1954 Tomas, Amelia, and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, through
counsel, filed a motion for the exclusion from the inventory of the Estate of
the thirteen lots therein mentioned, with <span style="">a </span>total area of 2,348 square meters, claiming that the same had
been sold by the deceased Vito <span class="SpellE">Bor­romeo</span> during his
lifetime to the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Arcade, T. L. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for exclusion was denied by the
lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="7">July 16,
 1954</st1:date>, and the ruling was reiterated in the appealed decision ‘for
the same reasons and considerations’ upon which it rejected the probate of the
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling on the matter, however,
was expressly made provisional in nature.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We believe, and so hold, that the resolution of the lower
court on this matter is correct because said court, acting in its capacity <span style="">as a </span>probate court, had no
jurisdiction to determine with finality the question of ownership
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such matter must be
litigated in a separate action has been the es­tablished jurisprudence in this
jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Ongsinco</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-7635, 1955; <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mallari</span></span><span style=""> </span>vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-4656, </span><st1:date year="1953" day="23" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 23, 1953</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; Garcia vs.
Martin G. R. No.</span> L-9233, June 29, 1957; Cordova vs. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
73 Phil. 661; <span class="SpellE">Pas­cual</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, 73 Phil. 561 and others),
except where a party merely prays for the inclusion or ex­clusion from the
inventory of any particular property, in <span style="">which
</span>case the probate court may pass upon, provi­sionally, the question of
inclusion or exclusion, but without prejudice to its final determination in an
appropriate separate action (Garcia vs. Garcia, 67 Phil. 353; <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> vs. Antonio, 70 Phil. 388; <span class="SpellE">Guin­guing</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span>, 48 Phil. 144, 147)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the pronouncement thus made in G. R. No. L-18498, it
is clear that the present action for prohibition can not stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the writ prayed for in the
petition is denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued herein <span style="">is </span>hereby set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against
respondents except respondent judge.</span></p>
