APPEALS, ANGELINA D. GUEVARA AND JUAN B. GUEVARA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for certiorari to review a decision of respondent
Court of Appeals was given due course because it was therein vigorously
asserted that legal questions of gravity and of moment, there being allegations
of an unwarranted departure from and a patent misreading of applicable and
controlling decisions, called for determination by this Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief for petitioners-spouses, however,
failed to substantiate such imputed failings of respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The performance did not live up to the
promise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the facts as
duly found by respondent Court, <span class="GramE">which</span> we are not at
liberty to disregard, and the governing legal provisions, there is no basis for
reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of the case presented before the lower court by
private respondent Angelina D. Guevara, assisted by her spouse, Juan B.
Guevara, as plaintiffs, was noted in the decision of respondent Court of
Appeals thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Plaintiff seeks
recovery of 'one (1) lady's diamond ring 18 <span class="SpellE">cts</span>. <span class="GramE">white</span> gold mounting, with one (1) 2.05 <span class="SpellE">cts</span>.
<span class="GramE">diamond-solitaire</span>, and four <span style="">(4) brills 0.10 <span class="SpellE">cts</span>. <span class="GramE">total</span>
weight' which she bought on </span><st1:date year="1947" day="27" month="10"><span style="">October 27, 1947</span></st1:date><span style=""> from R. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span>,
Inc."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Then came </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">summary of now
respondent Guevara of her evidence:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Plaintiff's evidence tends to show that around October 11, 1953
plaintiff while talking to Consuelo S. de Garcia, owner of La <span class="SpellE">Bulakeña</span> restaurant recognized her ring in the finger of
Mrs. Garcia and inquired where she bought it, which the defendant answered from
her </span><span class="SpellE"><u>comadre</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Plaintiff
explained that that ring was stolen from her house in February, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant handed the ring to plaintiff and it
fitted her finger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two or three days
later, at the request of plaintiff, plaintiff, her husband Lt. Col. Juan
Guevara, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Cementina</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
PD, defendant and her attorney proceeded to the store of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span> to whom, they showed the ring in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span>
examined the ring with the aid of high power lens and after consulting the
stock card thereon, concluded that it was the very ring that plaintiff bought
from him in 1947.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ring was returned
to defendant who despite a written request <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
failed to deliver the ring to plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence, this case.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on when the sheriff tried to serve the
writ of seizure (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">replevin</span></span>),
defendant refused to deliver the ring which had been examined by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span>, claiming </span><u>it was lost."</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">How the defendant, Consuelo S. de Garcia, the present petitioner
before us, along with her husband <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span style="">Garcia, </span>sought to meet plaintiff's
claim was narrated thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On the
other hand, defendant denied having made any admission before plaintiff or Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span> or the sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her evidence tends to show that the ring (Exhibit 1) was purchased by
her from Mrs. Miranda who got it from Miss <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Hinahon</span> who in turn got it from the owner, <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Petring</span>, who was boarding
in her house; that the ring she bought could be similar to, but not the same
ring plaintiff purchased from Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span> which was
stolen; that according to a pawn-shop owner the big diamond on Exhibit 1 was
before the trial never dismantled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
dismantled, defendant's diamond was found to weigh 2.57 <span class="SpellE">cts</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff lost in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She elevated the matter to respondent Court
of Appeals with the judgment of the lower court being reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this decision now under review.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are the facts as found by respondent Court of Appeals:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That the ring brought by the parties
for examination by Rafael <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span> on December 14,
1953 was the same ring purchased by plaintiff from R. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span>,
Inc. on October 27, 1947 and stolen in February, 1952 has been abundantly
established by plaintiff's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before plaintiff lost the ring, she had been wearing it for <span style="">six </span>years and became familiar with
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when she saw the missing ring
in the finger of defendant, she readily and definitely identified it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her identification was confirmed by Mr.
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span>, whose candid testimony is entitled
to great weight, with his 30 years experience behind him in the jewelry
business and being a disinterested witness since both parties are his
customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, defendant made no
comment when in her presence <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span> after
examining the ring and stock card told plaintiff that that was her ring, nor did
she answer plaintiff's letter of demand,* * * asserting ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further confirmation may be found in the
extra-judicial admissions, contained in defendant's original and first amended
answers<span style="">* * *. "</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These further facts likewise appear therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The foregoing proof is not
counterbalanced by the denial on the part of defendant or the presentation of
the ring, Exhibit I, which has <span style="">a </span>diamond-solitaire
weighing 2. 57 <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">cts</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> or much heavier than the lost diamond weighing 2.05 <span class="SpellE">cts</span>. <span class="GramE">only</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that defendant <span style="">gave a </span>rather dubious source of her
ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Petring</span> from whom the ring supposedly came turned out to be
a mysterious and ephemeral figure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miss <span class="SpellE">Hinahon</span> did not even know her true and full name, <span class="GramE">nor</span> her forwarding address.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She appeared from nowhere, boarded three months <span style="">in </span>the house of Miss <span class="SpellE">Hinahon</span> long
enough to <span style="">sell </span>her diamond ring,
disappearing from the scene a week thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the case <span style="">was </span>terminated
without any hearing on the third-party and fourth-party complaints, which <span style="">would have shown up the </span>falsity of
defendant's theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Baldomera</span> Miranda, third-party defendant, who tried to
corroborate defendant on the latter's alleged attempt to exchange the ring
defendant bought through her, is [belied] by her judicial admission in her
Answer that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 'suggested that she would make
alterations to the <span style="">mounting and
structural design of the ring to hide the true identity and appearance of the
original one' (<span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> <i>vs. </i><span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>,
45 O.G. 3796).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, defendant is refuted
by her own extra-judicial admissions</span><span style="">*</span><span style=""> * * although made by
defendant's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For an attorney who
acts as counsel of record and is permitted to act as such, has the authority to
manage the cause, and this includes the authority to make admission for the
purpose of the litigation.</span><span style=""> *</span><span style=""> * * Her <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
explanation that her counsel misunderstood her is puerile because the liability
to error as to the identity of the vendor and the exchange of the ring with
another ring of the same <span class="GramE">value,</span> was rather remote."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is in the light of the above facts as well as the finding that
the discrepancy as to the weight between the diamond-solitaire in Exhibit I and
the lost diamond was due to defendant having "substituted a
diamond-solitaire of plaintiff with a heavier stone" that the decision was
rendered, respondent Court reversing the lower court and ordering defendant,
now petitioner Consuelo S. de Garcia, to return plaintiff's ring or face value
of P1,000,00 and costs, as well as to pay plaintiff P1, 000.00 as attorney's
fees and P1, 000.00 as exemplary damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, there is no occasion to reverse respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It correctly applied the law to the facts as
found.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The controlling provision is Article 559 of the Civil <span style="">Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The possession of
movable property acquired in good faith is equivalent to a title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, one who has lost any movable or
has been unlawfully deprived thereof may recover it from the person in
possession of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the possessor
of a movable lost of which the owner has been unlaw­fully deprived, has
acquired it in good faith at a public sale, the owner cannot obtain its return
without reimbursing the price paid therefore. <span class="GramE">"
Respondent</span> Angelina D. Guevara, having been unlawfully deprived of the
diamond ring in question, was entitled to recover it from petitioner Consuelo
S. de Garcia who <span style="">was </span>found in
possession of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
exception the <span style="">law </span>allows is when
there is acquisition in good faith of the <span style="">possessor </span>at a public sale, in which case the owner cannot obtain
its return without reimbursing the price.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As authoritatively interpreted in Cruz v. <span class="SpellE">Pahati</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the right of the owner cannot be defeated even by proof that there was good
faith in the acquisition by the possessor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is <span style="">a </span>reiteration
of this principle in <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Yapdiangco</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Suffice it to say in this
regard that the right of the owner to recover personal property acquired in
good faith by <span class="GramE">another,</span> is based on his being dis­possessed
without his consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The common law
principle that where one of two innocent persons must suffer by a fraud
perpetrated by another, the law imposes the loss upon the party who, by his
misplaced confidence, has enabled the fraud to be committed, cannot be applied
in <span style="">a </span>case which is covered by
an express provision of the new Civil Code, specifically Article 559.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between a common law principle and a
statutory provision, the latter must prevail in this jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="">2. It is thus immediately apparent that
there is no merit to the contention raised in the first assigned error that her
possession in good faith, equivalent to title, sufficed to defeat respondent
Guevara's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the above cases
demonstrate, even on that assumption the owner can recover the same once she
can show illegal deprivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Court of Appeals was so convinced from the evidence submitted that the owner of
the ring in litigation is such respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is <span style="">a </span>factual
determination to which we must pay heed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of proving any alleged departure from legal norms by respondent
Court, petitioner would stress Article 541 of the Civil Code, which
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A possessor in the
concept of owner has in his favor the legal presumption that he possesses with
a just title and he cannot be obliged to show or prove it." She would
accord to it a greater legal significance than that to which under the
controlling doctrines it is entitled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The brief for respondents did clearly point out why petitioner's
assertion is lacking in support not only from the cases but even from
commentators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Actually, even under the first clause,
possession in good faith does not really amount to title, for the reason that
Art. 1132 of the Code provides for <span style="">a </span>period
of acquisitive prescription for movables through 'uninterrupted possession for
four years in good faith' (Art. 1955 of the old Spanish Code, which provided a
period of three years), so that many Spanish writers, including <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>, Sanchez Roman, <span class="SpellE">Scaevola</span>,
De <span class="SpellE">Buen</span>, and Ramos, assert <span style="">that </span>under Art. <span class="GramE">464 of the Spanish Code.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 559 of the New Civil Code), <u>the
title of the possessor in good faith is not that of owner­</u><u><span style="">ship, but is merely a presumptive title
sufficient to serve as </span>a basis for acquisitive prescription</u> (II <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Civil Code of the Phil. p. 258; IV <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Derecho</span> Civil <span class="SpellE">Español</span>, 6th Ed., p. 380).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And it is for the very reason that the title established by the first
clause of Art. 559 is only a presumptive title sufficient to serve as a basis
for acquisitive prescription, that the clause immediately following provides
that 'one who has lost any movable or has been unlawfully deprived thereof, may
recover it from the person in possession of the same'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the Honorable Justice Jose B. L.
Reyes of this Court in Sotto <i>vs. </i><span class="SpellE">Enage</span> (C.
A.), 43 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. 5075, Dec.
1947:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Article 559 in fact assumes that
the possessor is as yet not the owner; for it is obvious that where the
possessor has come to acquire indefeasible title by, let us say, adverse
possession for the necessary period, no proof of loss or illegal deprivation
could avail the former owner of the chattel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would no longer be entitled to recover it under any condition.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The second assigned error is centered on the alleged failure to
prove the identity of the diamond ring.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly the question raised is one of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Court of Appeals found is
conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, petitioner could not
demonstrate that in reaching such a conclusion the Court of Appeals acted in an
arbitrary manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As made mention of in
the brief for respondents two disinterested witnesses, Mr. Rafael <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span> as well as Lt. Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Cementina</span>
of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Police Department, both of whom
could not be accused of being biased in favor of respondent Angelina D.
Guevara, did testify as to the identity of the ring.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third assigned error of petitioners would find fault with
respondent Court relying "on the weakness of the title <span style="">or evidence" </span>of petitioner
Consuelo <span style="">S. </span>de Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">It is true, in the decision
under review, mention <span style="">was </span>made
of petitioner Consuelo S. de Garcia making no comment when in her presence <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span>, after examining the ring and the stock card,
told respondent Angelina D. Guevara that that was her ring, nor did petitioner
answer a letter of the latter asserting ownership.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was
</span>likewise stated in such decision that there were extra-judicial
admissions in the original and first amended answers of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the appraisal of her testimony, respondent
Court likewise spoke of her giving a rather dubious source of her ring, the
person from whom she allegedly bought it turning out "to be a mysterious
and ephemeral figure." As a matter of fact, <span style="">as </span>set forth a few pages back, respondent Court did enumerate
the flaws in the version given by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the weakness of the testimony offered which, as thus made clear,
petitioner, did not even seek to refute, she would raise the legal question
that respondent Court relied on the "weakness of [her] title or
evidence" rather than on the proof justifying respondent Angelina D.
Guevara's claim of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
here would ignore the finding of fact of respondent Court that such ownership
on her part "has been abundantly established" by her evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again here, in essence, the question raised
is one of fact, and there is no justification for us to reverse respondent
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legal question raised in the fourth assignment of error is
that the matter of the substitution of the diamond on the ring was a question
raised for the first time on appeal as it was never put in issue by the pleadings
nor the subject of reception of evidence by both parties and not touched upon
in the decision of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
no such question could be raised in the pleadings of respondent Angelina D.
Guevara was clarified by the fact that the substitution came after it was
brought for examination to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rebullida</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the knowledge of such substitution was
gained, however, the issue was raised at the trial according to the said
respondent resulting in that portion of the decision where the lower court reached
a negative conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, in
the motion for reconsideration, one of the points raised as to such decision
being contrary to the evidence is the finding that there was no substitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary to state that respondent
Court, exercising its appellate power reversed the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">was </span>held by it is controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is clear is that there is no factual
basis for the legal arguments on which the fourth assigned error is predicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is said takes care of the fifth assigned error that
respondent Court <span style="">was </span>mistaken in its finding that there was such a
substitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again petitioner would
have us <span style="">pass </span>on
a question of credibility which is left to respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sixth assigned error would complain
against the reversal of the lower court judgment <span style="">as </span>well as petitioner Consuelo <span style="">S. </span>de Garcia being made to pay respondent Angelina D. Guevara
exemplary damages, attorney's fees and costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reversal is called for in the light of the appraisal of the evidence
of record <span style="">as </span>meticulously
weighed by respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the
attorney's fees and exemplary damages, this is what respondent Court said in
the decision under review:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Likewise, plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's
fees in the sum of P1, 000, it being just and equitable under the
circumstances, and another P1, 000 as exemplary damages for the public good to
discourage litigants from resorting to fraudulent devices to frustrate the ends
of justice, <span style="">as </span>defendant herein
tried to substitute the ring, Exhibit 1, for plaintiff's ring."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering the circumstances, the cursory discussion of the sixth assigned
error on the matter by petitioner fails to demonstrate that respondent Court's
actuation is blemished by legal defects.</p>
