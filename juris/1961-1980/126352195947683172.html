1963</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier and 
respondent Felix <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span> ran and were voted for the 
position of municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique.</p>
<p>During the canvassing of the election returns conducted by the Municipal 
Board of Canvassers, it was found that in the election return for Precinct No. 
4, respondent <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span> was credited with 23 votes 
only, whereas in the tally board of the same precinct, he appeared to have 
obtained 83 votes. Apprised of the discrepancy, the members of the Board of 
Inspectors of said Precinct No. 4, recognizing their error committed in the 
process of transferring and copying the number of votes obtained by respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span> from the tally board to the election return, 
unanimously and immediately filed a verified petition with the Municipal Board 
of Canvassers, requesting permission to correct the election return of said 
precinct to make it conform with the true and correct votes actually obtained by 
said candidate as appearing in the tally board, inasmuch as the discrepancy in 
the votes will materially affect the result of the election for the position of 
mayor. Informed of this situation, the representative of the Commission on 
Elections, Atty. Tomas del Castillo, assigned in the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Culasi</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, thereupon instructed the 
Board of Canvassers to suspend the canvassing of the election return of said 
precinct No. 4 with respect to the office of municipal mayor. As the Board of 
Canvassers did not heed the unanimous petition of the Board of Inspectors and 
the advise of Atty. Del Castillo, the latter transmitted a telegraphic report 
thereof to the Commission on Elections which in turn, ordered the Board of 
Canvassers by telegram, on November 15, 1963, to suspend the canvass of election 
return in Precinct No. 4 as well as the proclamation of the winner to the office 
of municipal mayor. On the same day, November 15, respondent <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span> filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of 
Antique, a petition for judicial recounting of the votes in Precinct No. 4 of 
<span class="SpellE">Culasi</span> and said case was docketed as Election Case No. 
1-G3. Acting thereon, the Court of First Instance of Antique set the case for 
hearing on <st1:date month="11" day="22" year="1963">November 22, 
1963</st1:date>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, as already stated, the Board of Canvassers, in 
spite of the unanimous petition of the Board of Inspectors including the 
representative of both the parties, as well as the order of the representative, 
of the Commission on Elections, proceeded with the canvassing of the returns and 
proclaimed herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier as elected 
mayor of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique. In view of this 
proclamation, the case for recounting filed in the Court of First Instance, was 
dismissed.</p>
<p>On November 26, 1963, the Commission on Elections promulgated a resolution 
holding that as the canvass of the votes cast for the office of mayor in the 
election return of Precinct No. 4 was made in disregard of a lawful order of the 
duly authorized representative of the Commission, the proclamation of petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier as mayor-elect on the basis of said 
canvass, was null and void. Accordingly, petitioner's proclamation as mayors 
elect by the Board of Canvassers was annulled. The members of the Board of 
Canvassers were suspended, and Atty. Del Castillo was authorized to appoint any 
qualified persons in the municipality to act in place of the suspended members 
of said board, and to hold another canvass of the votes cast for the office of 
mayor for all the precincts, after the true count of votes in Precinct No. 4 had 
been determined. The candidates concerned were also directed to file the 
necessary petition in court to determine the true result of the votes cast in 
said precinct.</p>
<p>It is against this action of the Commission on Elections that petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier filed the instant petition in this 
Court, claiming that the Commission on Elections gravely abused its discretion 
in issuing the above-mentioned resolution of November 26, 1963, for the reason 
that, upon his proclamation as elected mayor of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique, the Commission had lost jurisdiction to 
annul such proclamation or the results of the election; that after it had 
canvassed the election returns and the winners were proclaimed, municipal board 
of canvassers became <span class="SpellE"><em>functus</em></span><em> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></em> can no longer be suspended; and that the 
Commission cannot authorize its representative, Atty. Tomas del Castillo, to 
appoint new members of the board of canvassers, its composition being 
specifically designated by law and may be substituted only for causes and in the 
manner provided in the law.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no controversy as to the fact that the proclamation of herein 
petitioner as elected mayor was made by the municipal board of canvassers 
notwithstanding the instruction of the representative of the Commission on 
Elections to suspend such proclamation, and which directive was sustained by the 
Commission itself on <st1:date month="11" day="15" year="1963">November 15, 
1963</st1:date>. Likewise, it is not here contested that Atty. Del Castillo, as 
duly appointed attorney of the Commission on Elections, has authority to take 
immediate action of any matter relative to the administration and enforcement of 
election laws and the rules and rulings of the Commission. Petitioner, however, 
claims that the board of canvassers is not expected to heed such "instruction" 
because the alleged basis thereof was discrepancy between the election returns 
and the tally board which is not a statement of election returns as provided in 
the law.</p>
<p>While it is true that the discrepancy here appears in the figures in the 
election return and the tally board, nevertheless, in the face of the verified 
unanimous petition of the board of inspectors informing the board of canvassers 
that a clerical mistake was committed in the process of transferring the figures 
from the official count in the tally board to the election return, and praying 
for the correction thereof,—a ground sufficient to justify the correction or 
amendment of such return under Section 154 of the Election Code, <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> the suspension of the proclamation of 
the winner of the affected position becomes imperative to enable the interested 
party to secure proper judicial relief. Even in the Resolution of the Commission 
on Elections promulgated on July 24, 1963, containing specific instructions for 
the guidance of all boards of canvassers, among others, the provincial, city or 
municipal board of canvassers is enjoined to suspend the canvass of votes cast 
in an affected precinct where the entry of votes in the election return is on 
its face clearly falsified or not legible.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Here, the falsity of the figure on the 
election return, brought about by error or clerical mistake, was not only clear 
on its face but attested to as a fact by all the members of the board of 
election inspectors of the precinct. The directive of the Commission 
representative directing, under the circumstances, the suspension of the 
proclamation, being in order, the continuation of the canvass and consequent 
proclamation of petitioner, in violation of said directive, is null and void. 
The suspension of the members of the said board of canvassers and the order to 
appoint substitutes to take their place in a new canvass of the election returns 
of all the precincts after the error in the election return of Precinct No. 4 
has been rectified, must be sustained.<span class="style11"><sup>[3]</sup></span> 
</p>
<p>It is also contended that the Commission on Elections can no longer order the 
suspension of the board of canvassers after it had completed the canvass of the 
election returns and proclaimed the result thereof, said body having become 
<span class="SpellE"><em>functus</em></span><em> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></em>, citing the case of Bautista vs. <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span><span class="GramE">.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>4]</sup></span> It is true that in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case, this Court said:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>" * * * It maybe conceded as a general proposition that when a board of 
canvassers has fully performed its duty and proclaimed the result of the 
election according to law and adjourned sine die, it may be deemed <span class="SpellE"><em>functus</em></span><em> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></em> 
in the sense that the members of the board have no power voluntarily to 
reassemble and <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> the 
returns."</p></blockquote>
<p>But the foregoing pronouncement finds ho application in this case where, as 
already ruled, the canvass and proclamation were made in violation of the lawful 
order of the Commission on Elections. Furthermore, where an election return has 
been amended by court order or the election return from a certain precinct has 
been wrongfully or erroneously excluded by the board of canvassers, we held that 
the Commission on Elections has the power to order a new canvass of the returns 
even after a proclamation had already been made.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> The underlying theory <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, it was said, is the ministerial duty of the board 
of canvassers to base the proclamation on the election returns of all the 
precincts of the municipality.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[6]</sup></span> 
Where the board of canvassers, as in this instance, with knowledge that the 
return from one precinct is undoubtedly vitiated by clerical mistake, continued 
the canvass and proclaimed a winner based on the result of such canvass, the 
proclamation cannot be said to have been made in faithful discharge of its 
ministerial duty under the law. Also, the doctrine enunciated in the Bautista 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Fugoso</span> case, evidently was to forestall the 
re-convening of the board of canvassers <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> for the purpose of changing the result of the 
canvass after a proclamation has already been made, and not the meeting of said 
board pursuant to a lawful order of the authorities.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>As regard the appointment of substitutes to replace the suspended erring 
members of the board of canvassers, it may be stated that under Section 167 of 
the Revised Election Code<span class="GramE">,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[</sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>7]</sup></span> running for a public office is not the 
only instance when a member is disqualified from acting in the board of 
canvassers. The provision does not exclude absence or incapacity for any lawful 
cause as grounds for their substitution by registered voters belonging to the 
party of the replaced member. Needless to state in this connection, that the 
defiance by the original members of the board of canvassers of the lawful order 
and instruction of the Commission on Elections is a valid cause for their 
removal and substitution by qualified persona.</p>
<p>Petitioner likewise set up the defense of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>, in view of the dismissal by the Court of First 
Instance of Antique of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang's</span> petition 
for recount of votes in Precinct No. 4, against the questioned resolution of the 
Commission on Elections. It may be pointed out that the order of dismissal of 
said petition was based on the fact that a winner to the petition of mayor had 
already been proclaimed. This order, of course, was based on the legal 
presumption that such proclamation by petitioner was regular. Considering the 
conclusion we have reached in this case—that the proclamation was null and 
void—the aforesaid dismissal of the petition for recount cannot bar any remedy 
that may be available to respondent <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span> under 
the circumstances.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition filed herein is dismissed, with costs against 
the petitioner. </p>
