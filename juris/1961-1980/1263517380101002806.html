hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was declared for tax
purposes in the name of Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> under tax
declaration No. 4483 <span style="">issued </span>on </span></span><st1:date year="1950" day="29" month="12"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">December 29, 1950</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1956 the property was advertised for sale
at public auction by the Provincial Treasurer to satisfy the unpaid real estate
taxes thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The winning bidder was
Juan <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span>, plaintiff and now appellant in this
case, in whose favor the corresponding certificate of sale was issued on
October 30,1956, followed by a final bill of sale two years later, or on
October 31, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both instruments it
was clearly stated that the <span style="">delinquent
taxpayer was Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The final bill of sale was registered </span></span></span><span style="">in </span>the Office of the Register of Deeds
on <st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It turned out, however, that a greater portion of lot No. 1097
was and had been in the possession of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ireneo</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Ganancial</span>, </span>for which reason the present
action was filed <span style="">against </span>him by
Juan <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> for the recovery of such posses­sion and
of the value of the products <span style="">received
by said defendant from </span>the date of the execution of the final bill of <span style="">sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his answer the
defendant, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, denied the plaintiff's right
and asserted ownership in himself of the portion possessed by him, <span style="">allegedly covering some 15 hectares.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in its decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1963</st1:date>, found in favor of the defendant and
dismissed the complaint, without costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence this appeal by the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material antecedent facts are undisputed, being a matter of
official record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
No. 1097 was formerly public land which was the subject of several homestead applications
by different parties, among them Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span>,
Juan <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganancial</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span style="">decision </span>of the Director of Lands
dated July 27, 1950 the <span style="">application of
Sebastian </span><span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> was rejected; that of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ireneo</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Ganancial</span> was </span>"amended
so as to cover only portion '<span style="">A' </span>of
the lot in dispute (see sketch)<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and thereafter, <span style="">continued to be given
due course;" </span>and Juan <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> was given <span style="">"a </span>period of sixty (60) days from
his receipt of a copy of this <span style="">decision
within </span>which he may file an appropriate <span style="">application for portion </span>'B' of the lot in question; otherwise, <span style="">his preferential rights </span>thereto may be
declared forfeited."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> filed a petition in the
Bureau of <span style="">Lands on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1951</st1:date>, "seeking
relief" from the decision aforementioned, but was turned down by <span style="">order dated </span><st1:date year="1951" day="21" month="9"><span style="">September 21, 1951</span></st1:date><span style=""> on </span>the ground that it was filed out
of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appears that when the public sale was <span style="">advertised and carried out by reason of tax
delinquency </span>on the part of Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span>
he was not the owner of <span style="">the property
and had no rights whatsoever thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Cons</span></span>equently the purchaser
acquired nothing by <span style="">derivative </span><span style="">title from the supposed tax </span>delinquent,
in whose name the property was <span style="">assessed
and declared for tax purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends, however, that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">guilty of gross negligence in not </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">obtaining a tax </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">declara</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">tion in his <span style="">own </span>name and in not paying the
corresponding </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">taxes. <span style="">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The record reveals
indeed that it was <span style="">only in 1959 </span>that
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> obtained such declaration </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">and paid the
taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">A more or <span style="">less </span>similar
situation </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">was </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">considered <span style="">by this </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Court in </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the case of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>, et al. <span style="">vs.
</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Santos et al., </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">101 Phil. 1001,
where it was held that the </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">sale of real </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">estate for
delinquent </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">taxes not paid by the "declared owner" </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">of the whole parcel was </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">ineffective against the "undeclared </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">owner" of </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">one-half thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing Government vs. Adriano, 41 Phil. 112,
the Court further stated that the provisions of the Assessment Law for the sale
of the land for </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">non-</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">payment of taxes establish a proceeding <u>in</u> </span></span><span class="SpellE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><u><span style="">personam</span></u></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">not <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>, as the tax is not a
charge on the land alone; and what is sold is only the particular interest of
the person in whose name the land is assessed.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant cites the decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Paguio</span>
- <span style="">vs. </span>Ruiz, 93 Phil. 306, where
it was stated:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>(T)he law <span style="">is </span>positive and leaves us no choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
</span>harsh and drastic, but it is a necessary means of insuring the prompt
collection of taxes so essential to the life of the Govern­ment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Yet it was her gross negligence which brought about the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> predicament.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Knowing her property to be subject to tax, she neglected to pay her
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vigorous in her protest that
she was not given opportunity to protect her rights, she at least neglected to
put the Government in a position to allow her that opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, notwithstanding the categorical
mandate of section 2484 of the Revised Administrative Code, Which she was
presumed to know, and which makes it 'the duty of each person' acquiring real
estate in the city to make a <span style="">new </span>declaration
thereof, with the advertence that failure to do so shall make the assessment in
the name of the previous owner 'valid and binding on all persons interested,
and <u>for </u><u><span style="">all purposes</span></u><span style="">, </span>as though the same had been assessed
in the name of its actual owner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Paguio</span> vs. Ruiz was decided upon a
different <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">set
of facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There the declared owner was
herself the </span></span>real owner of the property <span style="">sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span>, </span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">in whose name </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the land was
assessed, did not have any right whatsoever thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the statement of the rule applicable
under the facts of the cited case, salutary as it may be in order to penalize
negligent tax payers and insure prompt collection of taxes, is obviously for
the benefit of the government and only incidentally, if at all, for the benefit
of third persons dealing with it as purchasers at tax sales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, these </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">persons may be </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">entitled </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">to a certain measure of protection when
acting in good faith, as against taxpayers whose negligence has caused the <span style="">government </span>to take the steps provided
by law for the collection of what <span style="">is </span>due
to it; but in the present </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">case </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">it cannot be said that appellant was acting in good faith when he
purchased lot no. 1097 in the sense of being unaware of the fact that Sebastian
<span class="SpellE">Parreño</span>, in whose name the </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">said lot </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">was assessed at
the time and for whose delinquency the <span style="">sale
was made, </span>had no right at all to the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
so </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">because </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">while </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the tax declaration (No. 4483) specifically </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">mentioned in the certificate of sale was issued on </span></span><st1:date year="1950" day="29" month="12"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">December 29, 1950</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> the decision of the Director of <span style="">Lands disapproving the homestead application </span>of Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> <span style="">was
rendered on </span></span></span><st1:date year="1950" day="27" month="7"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">July 27, 1950</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> and in effect
reaffirmed on </span></span><st1:date year="1951" day="21" month="9"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">September 21, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1951</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, when
appellant's petition for relief was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In other words, appellant knew, or at <span style="">least was charged with notice as a party in </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">that homestead </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">case, that <span style="">Sebastian </span></span></span><span class="SpellE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Parreño</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> could not possibly
have </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">been a delinquent taxpayer </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">because his tax
declaration had become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">, and </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">knew likewise </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganancial</span> was</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the <span style="">owner, </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">or </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the one entitled to and in actual possession of portion "A"
of lot No. 1097, as declared by the Director of Lands <span style="">in </span>his decision.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant
had no right </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">therefore to rely </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">on the tax
declaration in the name of Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Parreño</span> as </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">evidence of
ownership and claim that it </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">could be the <span style="">basis </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">of a good title
in </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">himself as against the real owner by reason
of the </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">latter’s failure to declare the property <span style="">in </span>his own name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Even the </span></span><st1:place><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Torrens</span></span></st1:place><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> <span style="">system of land registration, </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">which proclaims </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the indefeasibility of a registered title,
protects only innocent third parties.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">without prejudice

Although the Adriano case was decided at a time with the old Provincial
Assessment Law was still in force, the ruling there retains its validity in
view of the fact that the pertinent provisions of the old law are now
incorporated as sections 28 to 41 of C.A. No. 470, otherwise known as the
Assessment Law.</p>
