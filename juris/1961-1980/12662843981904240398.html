<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an action to recover 
actual, moral and exemplary damages aggregating P210<span class="GramE">,000</span>, dismissed by the Court <u>a quo</u> and on appeal 
certified to us by the Court of Appeals in view of the amount 
claimed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> D. Yap was the president and operator of the 
Philippine <span class="SpellE">Harvardian</span> College, an educational 
institution with its main office in Manila and branches in the provinces. Two of 
these were the San Fernando Branch in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">San 
Fernando</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">St. 
John's</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">College</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in <span class="SpellE">Calumpit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>. At the time of 
the act complained of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> was the Director of Private 
Schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In1950 appellants applied to the 
Bureau of Private Schools for permission to offer the Elementary course (grade 
school), a Junior Normal course (E. T. C.) and a Liberal Arts course (A.A.) in 
the St. John's College; and a law course and a one-year post-graduate course in 
Education in the San Fernando branch. On June 29, 1951 Bureau supervisors found, 
on inspection, that the latter branch had already opened the post-graduate 
course which was still under application. On September 10, 1951 the Assistant 
Director of Private Schools, Daniel M. <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, 
informed Yap by letter that in connection with the proposed course in the St 
John's College a representative of the Bureau had found a number of deficiencies 
which, if not thoroughly corrected, would be cause for the denial of the 
corresponding permit applied for. On October 16, 3951 <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> informed Yap, again by letter, that the petition to 
offer a post-graduate course in the San Fernando branch was disapproved by 
reason of deficiencies found in a general survey thereof. And on June 3, 1952 
similar action was taken by <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> on the petition to 
offer the three courses applied for in St. John's College, <span class="GramE">the</span> deficiencies previously pointed out not having been 
corrected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 30, 1952 Director <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> sent to the Secretary of Education a partial list of 
private school courses that had been <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> for 
the school year 1952-1953, together with the names of the respective schools 
offering them. The Secretary approved the list, which was then published the 
next day in <u>The Manila Chronicle</u>, <u>The Evening News</u> and other 
metropolitan papers. Among those included were:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Three months afterwards 
appellants filed this suit Against Director <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> in 
the Court of First Instance of Manila, for damages allegedly suffered by them 
because of aforementioned publication. Defendant filed his answer, with 
counterclaim; and after trial the court rendered judgment dismissing both the 
complaint and the counterclaim. <span class="GramE">Hence this 
appeal.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants maintain that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had no authority to issue the press release in 
question. On the other hand <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> justifies his 
action under Section 11, Act No. 2706, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Section 
11.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> The 
Secretary of Public Instruction (now Secretary of Education) shall be authorized 
to appoint a (Commissioner of Private Schools), who shall:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">5. Under the direction of the 
Secretary of Public Instruction, cause to be published from time to time, for 
the information at the public, a list of the approved private schools or 
colleges, setting forth what courses have been recognized in each school or 
college."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant's position is that the 
<span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> provision authorizes the Director of 
Private Schools to issue for publication only lists of approved private 
educational institutions and the courses they are authorized to offer, but not 
of the courses that have been disapproved and the schools offering them. This 
interpretation of the statute is much too literal and narrow, and at times 
impractical for the purpose sought to be attained. Indeed there is no cogent 
reason to hold that the authority therein given is restrictive in the sense of 
prohibiting the publication of any other information relevant to the supervision 
of private educational institutions. Even without statutory authority of any 
kind, the issuance of press releases informative of official action is normal 
procedure in our democratic system, and should generate no liability, civil or 
criminal, unless clearly against some legal provision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case at bar, the 
publication authorized by Act No. 2706 is expressly "for the information of the 
public." It is obviously intended for the benefit of students and, of course, of 
their parents. Without proper information and warning, students might enroll in 
schools not duly authorized or take courses for which later on they might not be 
duly credited. The resulting loss in time, money and effort would be 
incalculable. The manner outlined in the law, if strictly and literally 
construed, may easily prove inadequate to prevent such result. For the fact that 
a school or course is not included in an approved list would not necessarily 
lead a prospective student to conclude that it has been disapproved. Such lists 
are published from time to time, and a check of all of them would be a task very 
few would care to undertake. Indeed the procedure observed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> could be in certain instances the only effective 
means of providing information to the public. It appears that a school may offer 
a course even while its petition for permit is still pending in the Bureau of 
Private Schools. If only lists of approved courses are published and lists of 
disapproved ones are not, the public would not know whether the permit for a 
given course is still pending approval or has been definitely disapproved. Again 
a duly recognized private school may have been permitted to offer a certain 
number of courses, which are then included for publication in the approved list. 
Later on, however, the standard of the school deteriorates, or it so incurs 
deficiencies in some of its courses that their corresponding permits <span class="GramE">are</span> cancelled. If no list of such disapproved courses is 
published the public would continue to believe that they are still valid. It is 
true that a school may be penalized for maintaining courses that have been 
disapproved; but the penalty would not redress the prejudice already caused to 
the students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the particular case of 
appellants, they applied for permits to offer four new courses. The 
investigation conducted by supervisors of the Bureau of Private Schools revealed 
certain deficiencies. They were brought to the attention of the appellants, but 
the deficiencies were not corrected. When the applications were denied for that 
reason, the Director of Private Schools acted within his authority in including 
the said courses in the list released for publication.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant Yap claims that prior 
to the release of the list he sent letters to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
informing him (on November 11, 1951) that the post-graduate course in the San 
Fernando branch had been discontinued and (on March 19, 1952) that the 
elementary and collegiate courses in the St. John's College would not be offered 
for the coming school year <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> denied having 
received those alleged letters, Exhibits B and C, and there is no proof that he 
had. It may be noted that the exhibits are not duplicates or carbon copies, but 
appear to be unsigned originals—a circumstance which casts serious doubt on the 
claim that the letters had actually been sent to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants invoke the precept in 
Article 19 of the Civil Code that every person must, in the exercise of his 
rights and the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his 
due and observe honesty and good faith. The record shows that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> acted in conformity therewith. It does not appear 
that he sought to cause damage to appellants. He did not single out the schools 
they were operating; they were only two in a list of 66 private educational 
institutions whose applications for permits had been 
disapproved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants say that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> branded said schools as "diploma mills. Reference 
is made to the following portion of the news item carried by <u>The Evening 
News</u> of July 1, 1952:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This was announced yesterday by 
Private Schools Director Manuel <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> who also 
disclosed that the action taken by the bureau was the result of a six-month 
survey by the bureau aimed at weeding cut 'diploma 
mills.’"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">and</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the following news excerpt which 
appeared in another paper:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Basis for the order to close, 
which was finally given after a long delay, <span class="GramE">were</span> the 
reports received from private school supervisors in the field as well as from 
records available in the bureau. Screening of schools had been going on for the 
past several months in line with the bureau of private schools drive against 
'diploma mills’”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is no evidence that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> himself applied the epithet objected to. What is 
certain is that he made the list public. Whether the release thereof was 
accompanied by a personal statement of his or whether he used the term "diploma 
mills" has not been satisfactorily shown. He did not write the news stories; the 
newspapermen did. The imputation was at best hearsay, or was merely the 
reporters' own interpretation of the action taken by the Bureau of Private 
Schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellee</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, it is pointed out, issued no 
denial of the statement attributed to him by <u>The Evening News</u>. From this 
fact, however, no presumption arises that he did make such a statement. He was 
not supposed to scan all the newspapers and deny statements therein that might 
have been attributed to him. In the absence of more reliable evidence that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> himself used the term "diploma mills," 
responsibility <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> cannot be laid at his 
door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The judgment appealed from is 
affirmed, with costs against appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
