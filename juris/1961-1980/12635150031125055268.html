				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The appellant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Doriquez</span>, on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1964</st1:date>, was charged with the
offense of grave oral defamation before the Court of First Instance of Iloilo,
by virtue of an information which re­cites</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about April 22, 1964, in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Batad</span>, province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Court, the above-named defendant, with deliberate in­tent
of bringing Attorney <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Demaisip</span>
into dis­credit, disrepute and public contempt, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously speak and utter in a loud voice and in the presence
of many persons against the said Attorney <span class="SpellE">Demaisip</span>
the following insulting and defamatory words and expressions, to wit: '<span class="SpellE">Tonto</span> ka <span class="SpellE">nga</span> <span class="SpellE">klase</span>
sang <span class="SpellE">tao</span>, <span class="SpellE">quin</span> <span class="SpellE">pierde</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">asunto</span>

<span class="SpellE">pero</span> <span class="SpellE">linibo</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">gasto</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>,'
which, translated into English' runs as follows: 'You are a foolish class of
person, you had to lose my case, I spent thousands of pesos and later you
allowed yourself to be sold to <span class="SpellE">Purita</span>; you had been
telling people that I paid you only<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>P30.00 when I spent thousand of pesos for my case,' and other similar
words of import."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Six days later, or on <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1964</st1:date>, the same <span class="SpellE">Doriquez</span> was indicted before the same court for discharge
of firearm, committed, in the language of the information, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about April 22, 1964, in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Batad</span>, province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Court, the said accused, armed with a revolver and without
intent to kill, did then and there willfully, un­lawfully and feloniously
discharge twice said re­volver at one Attorney <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Demaisip</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to the two indict­ments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 3, 1964 he moved to dismiss both <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, claiming that (1) the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
has no jurisdiction over the offense of grave oral defamation in virtue of
Republic Act 3328 which enlarged the original exclusive jurisdiction of city
and mu­nicipal courts; and (2) the institution of the criminal action for
discharge of firearm places him in double jeopardy for he had already been in
jeopardy once in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Batad</span>, Iloilo
which dismissed, without his consent, the information charging him with the
offense of alarm and scandal, allegedly based on the self-same facts/relied
upon by Fiscal Simeon A. <span class="SpellE">Barranco</span> in support of the
aforesaid information for discharge of firearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="3">March 8,
 1965</st1:date> the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> denied the motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent motion for
reconsideration was likewise denied by the trial court in its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From these two orders, the present appeal was
inter­posed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our view, in the first instance, that the appeal is pre­mature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Only final judgments or orders shall be subject to
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No interlocutory or incidental
judgment or order shall stay the progress of an action, nor shall it be the
subject of an appeal until final judgment or order is rendered for one party or
the other."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Construing the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
section, this Court has repeatedly and uniformly held that a judgment or order
may be appealed only when it is final - in the sense that it completely
disposes of the cause and definitively adjudicates the respective rights of the
parties, leaving thereafter no substantial proceeding to be had in connec­tion
with the case except the proper execution of the judgment or order; and that,
conversely, an interlocutory order or judgment is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
for it does not decide the action with finality and leaves substantial
proceedings still to be had.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is an elemen­tary rule of adjective law that an order denying a motion to
dismiss is interlocutory, hence not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>,
because it "does not termi­nate the proceedings, nor finally dispose of
the contentions of the parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
An order, for example, rejecting a motion to dismiss based on lack of
jurisdiction<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is interlocutory because after such denial proceedings of substance are still
to be had by the trial court, such as hearing of the case on the merits and
rendition of final judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latest unequivocal restatement of the rule that interlo­cutory
orders are not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> was made in <u>Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Ardant</span> Trading Corporation</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Concluding that the appeal therein was pre­mature, Mr. Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> emphasized that "the orders denying
defendant's motion for dismissal and its sub­sequent motion for reconsideration
are interlocutory in nature, and hence, not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
until after the rendition of judgment on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant's appeal contravenes the explicit
provisions of Rule 41, Section 2, of the Rules of Court . . . which, moreover,
incorporates a well-established rule of practice and procedure, constituting
one of the main tenets of our remedial law." In order to stress its
disapproval of appeals from interlo­cutory orders, this Court, in the
aforementioned case, assessed treble costs against the appellant therein,
jointly and severally, with its counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rationale underlying the rule that an interlocutory order is
not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> is, basically, the avoidance of
"multipli­city of appeals in a single case." If every interlocutory
order or judgment may be appealed, and the appeal stays the progress of the
action, there could arise countless appeals in a single case, and the magnitude
and extent of the delay in the final disposition thereof will be such that,
conceivably, in a number of instances, the parties may not survive the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court has consis­tently frowned upon - and has firmly stricken down - piece-meal
appeals, "because it [piece-meal appeal] delays the speedy dispo­sition of
the case, and is often resorted to as a means of draining the resources of the
poorer party and of compelling it to submit out of sheer exhaustion, even if
its demands should be conforma­ble to reason and justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two alternative remedies were forthwith available to <span class="SpellE">Do­riquez</span> after the denial of his motion for
reconsideration, namely, (1) proceed immediately to trial on the merits and
interpose as integral part of his defense the grounds stated in his motion to
dismiss, and, in the event of an adverse decision, appeal to the proper Court
for resolution of all pertinent issues, including those he has posed in the
present appeal; (2) interpose a petition for <u>certiorari</u> to enable this
Court to dispose, on the merits, the is­sues raised herein, anchoring said
petition on the twin grounds that (a) the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> acted
without jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction in taking cognizance of
the offense of grave oral defamation, and (b) the trial judge committed grave
abuse of dis­cretion in refusing to dismiss the information for discharge of
firearm in the face of his avowal that the said indictment places him in peril
of a second jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter action
should of course be availed of with candor and absolute absence of deviousness,
with no intention (howsoever disguised) of causing undue delay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because, however, all the cogent issues are now before us, we
will treat the instant appeal as a petition for <u>certiorari</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This positive and pragmatic approach will
definitively resolve the contentions of <span class="SpellE">Doriquez</span> and
thus dissipate any and all specu­lation on the part of all concerned as to the
correctness of their respective positions.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <span class="SpellE">Doriquez</span> maintains that the municipal
court of <span class="SpellE">Batad</span>, Iloilo, not the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo, has original exclusive jurisdiction over the offense of
grave oral defamation which, under article 358 of the Revised Penal Code, is
punisha­ble by <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u> in its
maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correcional</u></span>
in its minimum period, reasoning that the exclusive original jurisdiction of
municipal and city courts has been enlarged by Republic Act 3828 to include
offenses for which the penalty pro­vided by law is imprisonment for not more
than three years, or a fine of not more than three thousand pesos, or both such
imprisonment and fine.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant is in error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is now beyond all area of dispute that in view of the
latest amendment to section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 and also taking
into account the unaltered provisions of section 44(f) of the same Act, the
zone of concurrent jurisdiction of municipal and city courts and courts of
first instance has been con­siderably widened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This jurisdictional parity embraces all of­fenses for which the penalty
provided by law is imprisonment for more than six months but not exceeding
three years (or six years with respect to city courts and municipal courts in
the capitals of provinces and sub-provinces <span class="SpellE"><u>vis</u>-<u>a</u>-<u>vis</u></span>
the courts of first instance), or a fine of more than two hundred pesos but not
exceeding three thousand pesos (or six thousand pesos in the proper cases), or
both such imprisonment and fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
confluence of jurisdiction was first clearly etched in <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span><u>
vs. Avila et al</u>, <a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> and
the rule in that case was affirmed in <u>Le <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> vs. Reyes</u> <a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Andico</u></span><u> vs. Roan, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span><u> vs. Avila</u>, Mr.
Justice J.B.L. Reyes delinea­ted with specificity the respective jurisdictional
boundaries of the various trial courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said Mr. Justice Reyes:</p>

<blockquote>"The fallacy in petitioner's argument lies in his failure to
consider section 44(f) of the same Judiciary Act of 1948, in, conjunction with
its section 87(c).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that
notwithstanding the various amendments received by section 87, section 44(f) remained
unaltered, thereby indicating the intention of the legislators to retain the
original juris­diction of the court of first instance in certain ca­ses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the jurisdiction of the
municipal or city courts was enlarged in virtue of the amendment of section
87(c), cannot be taken as a repeal or withdrawal of the jurisdiction conferred
on the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only
is implied repeal disfavored by the law, but also, it is a cardinal principle
that a statute must be so construed as to harmonize all apparent conflicts, and
give effect to all its provisions whenever possible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Actually, there is nothing irreconcilable bet­ween sections
44(f) and 87(c) of the Judiciary Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As therein provided, the court of first ins­tance was given
original jurisdiction over cases where the penalty prescribed by law is
imprisonment for <u>more than 6 months</u> or fine of more than P200.00; the
justices of the peace and municipal or city courts of chartered cities, over
cases where the penalty is im­prisonment for <u>not more than 3 years</u>, and
fine of <u>not more than P3,000.00</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, where the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for more
than 6 months, but not exceeding 3 years, or fine of more than P200.00 but not
exceeding P3,000.00 the justice of the peace or municipal court only has
concurrent (and not exclusive) original jurisdiction with the court of first
instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it may be stated that
this concurrent jurisdiction between the inferior courts and the court of first
ins­tance was not provided for the first time in Republic Act No. 3828.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Republic Act 2613, crimes the pe­nalties
for which do not exceed 3 years, or fine of not more than P3,000.00, were
specifically placed within the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace and
munici­pal courts, concurrent with the court of first instance.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"It follows, therefore,
that the <u>exclusive</u> ori­ginal jurisdiction of the justice of the peace
and muni­cipal courts is confined only to cases where the pres­cribed penalty
is imprisonment for <u>6 months or less</u>, or fine of <u>P200.00 or less</u>,
whereas, the <u>exclusive</u> original jurisdiction of the court of first
instance covers cases where the penalty is incarceration for more than 3 years
(or 6 years in the case of city courts and municipal courts in provincial capitals),
or fine of more than P3,000.00 (or P6,000.00 in proper cases), or both such
imprisonment and fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between these
exclusive jurisdictions lies a zone where the juris­diction is concurrent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the proper construc­tion to be placed
on the provisions involved herein, regardless of what may have been the prior
rulings on the matter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The offense of grave oral defamation which carries a maximum
penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
in its minimum period (or incarceration not exceeding 2 years and 4 months)
falls within the above-described zone of concurrent jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
did not err in assuming jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. <span class="SpellE">Doriquez</span> likewise contends that the
filing a the infor­mation for discharge of firearm has placed him in peril of double
jeopardy as he had previously been charged with the offense of alarm and
scandal in a complaint filed in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Batad</span>,
Iloilo, upon the same facts which constitute the basis of the indictment for
discharge of firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said complaint,
which was allegedly dismissed without his consent, recites</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about 12:00 p.m., April 21, 1964, at the gate in
front of the Municipal Building, <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batad</span>, Iloilo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there <span class="SpellE">wil­fully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously with deliberate
intent to cause alarm in the public, discharge his License Revolver caliber .22
SN-368383 one on the ground and one into the air within the town limits and
without any justifiable purpose thus causing alarm upon the general
public."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This plea of <span class="SpellE">Doriquez</span> is obviously
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">For double jeopardy to attach in his favor, the accused must
prove, among other things, that there is "identity of offen­ses," so
that, in the language of section 9, Rule 117 of the Re­vised Rules of Court,
his "conviction or acquittal x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> or the dismissal of the case [without his express
consent] shall be a bar to another prosecution for the same offense charged or
for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense
which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in
the former complaint or information." It is altogether evident, however, that
the offense of discharge of firearm is not the crime of alarm and scandal, nor
is it an at­tempt or a frustration of the latter felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither my it be asserted that every crime of
discharge of firearm produces the offense of alarm and scandal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could the reverse situation be true, for
the less grave felony of discharge of firearm does not include or subsume the
offense of alarm and scandal which is a light felony.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the indictment for alarm and scandal filed under article
155(1) of the Revised Penal Code and the information for discharge of firearm
instituted under article 258 of the same Code are closely related in fact (as
the two apparently arose from the same factual setting, the firing of a
revolver by the accused being a common element), they are definitely diverse in
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the two indictments do not
describe the same felony - alarm and scandal is an offense against public order
while discharge of fire­arm is a crime against persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the indispensable ele­ment of the
former crime is the discharge of a firearm calculated to cause alarm or danger
to the public, while the <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> of the latter is
the discharge of a firearm against or at a certain person, without intent to
kill.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plea of double jeopardy cannot therefore be accorded merit,
as the two indictments are perfectly distinct in point of law howsoever closely
they may appear to be connected in fact.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a cardinal rule that the protection against double jeo­pardy
may be invoked only for the same offense<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
or identical offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
A single act may offend against two (or more) entirely distinct and unrelated
provisions of law, and if one provision requires proof of an additional fact or
element which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction or a dismissal of
the information under one does not bar prosecution under the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Phrased <span class="SpellE">elsewise</span>, where two different laws (or
articles of the same code) define two crimes, prior jeopardy as to one of them
is no obstacle to a prosecution of the other, although both offenses arise from
the same facts, if each crime involves some important act which is not an
essential element of the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar granting that the two indictments arose from
the same act - a contention traversed by the State - they describe and
constitute, nevertheless, essentially different felo­nies having fundamentally
diverse indispensable elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
there can be <u>no</u> such "identity of offenses" as would support
the suggestion that double jeopardy has ensued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge, there­fore, did not commit abuse of discretion in
refusing to dismiss the information for discharge of firearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, we hold that the instant appeal is premature, and that -
even if it were treated as a petition for <u>certiorari</u> - the con­tentions
and arguments of the appellant cannot be accorded credit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the present appeal is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case is hereby ordered remanded to the
court of origin for imme­diate trial on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the appellant.</p>
