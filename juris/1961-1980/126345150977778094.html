				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The case involves a dispute <span style="">over a </span>public office Barrio Captain - of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Batangas</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span style="">as an </span></span>off-shoot to the barrio
elections held by the residents of the said barrio of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1964</st1:date>, pursuant to
Republic Act 3590 known as the "BARRIO CHARTER".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the said elections,
the Board of Elect­ion Tellers proclaimed Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balido</span>
as the duly elected Barrio Captain </span>of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, who
received one hundred fifty-one (151) votes as against his opponent, Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Ba­lason</span> who <span style="">obtained
one hundred forty-nine (149) votes, with a plurality of two </span>(2) votes
over the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1964</st1:date>,
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Balason</span> filed election protest before the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
impugning the election of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balido</span> to the
office of Barrio Captain of <span class="SpellE">Concep<span style="">cion</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, on the
grounds of "(a) errors or mistakes or bad appreciation of ballots; and (b)
improper adjudication of votes."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a trial, the Municipal Judge rendered decision declaring
“the protestant (Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Balason</span>) the winner of the
elections for Barrio Captain in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, held on
January 12, 1964, with a plurality of six (6) votes..." The <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> was ordered to pay to the protestant 250.00 as
damages in the form of attorney's fees, plus P12.00 as commissioner's fees, and
the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balido</span> appealed to the Court of
First instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> from the decision of the
in<span style="">ferior court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a trial on the merits of the case, a decision was rendered
declaring "the protestant (Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Balason</span>) the
winner in the elections for Barrio Captain of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, held <span style="">last </span>January
12, 1964, with a plurality of three (3) votes over the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balido</span>, who <span style="">is </span>hereby ordered to pay to the protestant the sum of P300.00 as
attorney’s fees, and the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing last decision, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Ba­lido</span>
appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 8, Republic Act 3590, known <span style="">as </span>the BARRIO CHARTER, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"All disputes over barrio elect­ions shall be brought before
the justice of the peace court of the municipality concerned; <span class="GramE">And</span> in the determination and decision thereof, the court
shall follow as closely <span style="">as possible the
procedure prescribed for inferior courts in Rule 4, Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision or the jus­tice of the peace
court shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> pursuant to the Rules of </span>Court
to the Court of First Instance <u>whose decision shall be final on questions </u><u><span style="">of fact</span></u><span style="">."<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Six assignments of error are listed in the appellant's brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first error, the rejection by the trial court of the
ballots, exhibits DD and EE, for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, on
the ground they are marked, <span style="">is </span>as­sailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In urging for the reversal of the court's
ruling, the appellant says:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is
possible that the secretary of the Board of Election Tellers had placed these
numbers (332 and 333) on the questioned ballots, to indicate how much ballots
he had prepared or were in his possession before voting started." The
conten­tion, based as it is on <span style="">a </span>mere
supposition, is, obviously, without merit, for, if any semblance of truth there
could be in the assumption, to establish it as <span style="">a </span>fact, the appellant should have summoned any member of the
Board of Election Tellers to the witness stand to testify on that matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In relation to these two challenged ballots which the trial court
had rejected as marked, the court said:</p>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "DD", because it is a marked
ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The placing of No. 332 on the
upper right hand corner of the ballot enables a third person to determine,
without other aid, that it was the vote of a particular person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voter thereby endangers the secrecy of
his ballot by placing said number as a mark of identification."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "EE", where the number 333
(was written) on the ballot serves to identify the voter."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the second error, it is contended that the court erred in
not declaring the ballot, exhibit <span style="">W, </span>as
valid vote for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant argues <span style="">thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On the ballot, the
name of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balido</span> is written n the space for </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">sitio</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The lower court re­jected this <span class="GramE">ballot,</span> on the ground that <span class="SpellE">protestee’s</span>
name was not written on the proper space for barrio captain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court </span><span style="">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit ‘<span style="">W</span><span style="">,</span> where the name Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balido</span> is
written on the space for <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>. ‘In order that <span style="">a </span>vote may
be counted in favor of the candidate for <span style="">a </span>particular of­fice, his name must be
written in the space reserved on the ballot for the name of the candidate for
that office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the name is writ­ten in
the space reserved for ano­ther office, the ballot cannot be counted as a vote
for said per­son for the office for which he <span style="">is </span>a candidate." (<span class="SpellE">Aviado</span> <span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Telaus</span>, 52 Phil. 665.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the third error, the admission of the ballot, Exhibit 55,
as valid vote for the protestant, is assailed, on the ground that said ballot
"contains a completely and entirely distinct name from that of the
protestant."</p>

<p class="BODY">In reference to this particular ballot, the court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Exhibit ‘55’, where the name P. <span class="SpellE">Balason</span>
Guerra is written in the space for barrio captain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guerra <span style="">is </span>one of the <span class="GramE">candidate</span>
for councilman and the placing of his name in line with <span class="SpellE">Balason</span>
does not annul the vote in favor of the latter." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Amurao</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Calagi</span>, CA-G.</span> R.
No. 18240-R, <st1:date year="1457" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1457</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the fourth error, the ruling of the court in not rejecting
the ballots, exhibits 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 74, 75 and 76 for the protestant,
is assailed, <span style="">the appellant arguing that
- "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> as it may
readily be observed, these ballots are not the official ballots intended for
the use of the voters, because they are different from those originally
prepared and distribu­ted among them by the secretary of the Board of Elect­ion
Tellers."</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, the trial court <span style="">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Exhibits ‘58’, ‘59’, '60’, ‘61’, ‘62’, ‘63’, ‘74’, ‘75’, <span style="">and ‘76’.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">The </span><span style="">court cannot see how or in what way they
violated the secrecy of the ballot.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Further, the court declared valid the challenged ballots of protestant
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Balason</span> with a statement that his name is
writ­ten in the space for barrio cap­tain because in each and every one of said
ballot it can be seen that it was the intention of the voter to vote for said
candidate."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Specifically ruling on the ballot, exhibit 60, one of those
objected to on the ground that it was not an official ballot, the trial court
said:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Exhibit 60, where the name of P. <span class="SpellE">Balason</span> is written in the space of <span style="">Barrio Captain.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objection </span>that it is not an
official ballot <span style="">is </span>without <span style="">merit </span>considering
the testimony of Alfredo Austria, chairman of the Board of Inspect­ors, who
said that they had to use emergency ballots which they ran out of official ones
and that <span style="">said
</span>ballots were initialed by him before they were deposited into the box<span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the fifth error, the ruling of the <span style="">court </span>with reference to the ballots, exhibits 4, 7, <span style="">10, </span>11, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24,
29, 30, 32, 34, 35, 38, 39, 41, <span style="">42, 48,
</span>50, 51, 58, 59, 66, <span style="">68, 80, </span>and
83 <span style="">admitting them as valid votes for
the protestant, is assailed, appellant arguing thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The record will show that <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> stated the ground of his object­ion to each of
these ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, by merely
stating that ‘in all of which P. <span class="SpellE">Balason</span> is written
on the space for Barrio Captain’ did not resolve the objections <span class="GramE">raised</span> in the </span><span style="">way
</span><span style="">the rule provides."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, however, the appellant has fail­ed to state in his
brief the grounds of his objec­tions to the admission of said ballots, as he
had in­terposed in the lower court, and in view thereof, there <span style="">is </span>lacking a frame of reference upon
which to base a ruling on the admissibility of said ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, however, the reference to
the bal­lots, exhibits 58 and 59 in this error under consideration, which
ballots are also assailed under the fourth error, on the ground that they are
not official ballots, <span style="">gives </span>strong
indication that the questioned ballots under the fifth error were also objected
to for the identical reasons as those ballots mentioned in the fourth
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, there seems to be no
valid reason to reject the questioned ballots as valid votes for the
protestant, because, as the trial court said, "the said ballots were
counted as valid for the protestant, because the name of P. <span class="SpellE">Balason</span>
<span style="">is </span>already written on the
proper space for Barrio Captain."</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the sixth and last error, the ruling of the court admitting
the ballot, exhibit 57, as valid vote for the protestant, is disputed,
appellant con­tending that the name "<span class="SpellE">Perepeato</span>"
is not <u>idem</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">sonans</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>with "Perfecto".</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to this ballot, the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Exhibit '57’, where the name ‘<span class="SpellE">Perepeato</span>’
is written in the space for Barrio Captain. <span style="">‘A </span>name or surname incorrectly written which, when read <span style="">has a </span>sound
equal or similar to that of the real name or surname of <span style="">a </span>candidate shall be counted in his
favor.'" [Rule 2, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code.<span style="font-size: 12pt;">]</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing considerations clearly demons­trate that the issue
posed by the appellant in re­lation to the ballots disputed in his brief, is
factual, going into the correctness of the appre­ciation of the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the decision of the trial court on the
admissibility of said ballots is final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And there is no question of law raised in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is hereby dismissed on the
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, the question raised
being factual, the decision of the trial court is final, and this Court lacks
jurisdiction to review the appeal; and, secondly, the appreciation made by the
trial court of the disputed ballots being in accord­ance with the facts and the
law, the decision is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the appellant.</span></p>
