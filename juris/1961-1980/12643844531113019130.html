ordering the defendant-appellant Central Bank to refund to the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the sum of P194<span class="GramE">,058.62</span>, 
with 6% interest per annum from the date of filing of the complaint.</p>
<p>The parties to this suit do not dispute the facts. The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> imported from abroad a number of bales of 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Fiji</st1:place></st1:country-region> cloth and 
subsequently made sugar bags or containers out of them. For the transaction, it 
secured from the appellant Bank the corresponding foreign exchange and for which 
the Bank collected a 17% special excise tax on the authority of Section 1, 
Republic Act No. 601, as originally enacted, which provided:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"SECTION I. Except as herein otherwise provided there shall be assessed, 
collected and paid a special excise tax of seventeen per centum (17%) on the 
value in the Philippine peso of foreign exchange sold and/or authorized to be 
sold by the Central Bank of the Philippines or any of its agents during the 
period of two years counted from the date of the approval of this 
Act."</p></blockquote>
<p>Of the sugar bags made from the imported 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Fiji</st1:place></st1:country-region> cloth, some 
were exported abroad as containers of sugar manufactured by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> during the periods recited in the complaint. 
Accordingly, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> demanded from the appellant 
Bank the refund of the excise tax corresponding to the sugar bags used for the 
export, pursuant to the provision of Section 3 of the same Republic Act, to 
wit:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SECTION 3.</span> The tax collected on foreign exchange 
used for the payment of the cost, transportation and/or other charges incident 
"to importation into the Philippines of articles or container9 used by the 
importer himself in the manufacture or preparation of local products for 
consignment or export abroad shall likewise be refunded upon satisfactory proof 
under said rules and regulations that said imported articles or containers were 
actually used in the manufacture or preparation of such local products, forming 
part thereof, and that said local products have been actually 
exported."</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellant does not deny that the bags for which the refund is demanded 
were actually used and exports by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. 
Nevertheless, however, it rejects most of the claims for refund on the ground 
that the <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> right to demand the same had 
already prescribed. It insists that of the total claim "for P194.058.62, the 
amount of P151<span class="GramE">,756.06</span> is no longer refundable by reason 
of prescription."</p>
<p>The principal issue to be resolved in this case is, therefore, the 
prescriptive period for claims for refund under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 
601 as originally enacted.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> The 
defendant-appellant invokes this Court's ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE">Belman</span> <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> Inc. vs. Central Bank, 
G.R. No. L-15044, <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1960">May 30, 
1960</st1:date> and the Resolution on the motion for reconsideration filed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and <span class="GramE">maintains</span> that the 
prescriptive period is six years. On the other hand, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> contends that <span class="GramE">the</span> ruling 
in the case cited is inapplicable to the present suit and that the prescriptive 
period applicable is ten years.</p>
<p>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is correct.</p>
<p>For a clear understanding of what <span class="GramE">We</span> said in the 
case of <span class="SpellE">Belman</span> vs. Central Bank, <u>supra</u>, on the 
two occasions that it came for our consideration, We are reproducing hereunder 
the points thereon germane to the controversy under review.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1960">May 30, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">in ,the</span> main decision for that case, We said:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Defendant's collection of the Exchange Tax on <st1:date month="4" day="20" year="1951">April 20, 1951</st1:date> and <st1:date month="5" day="26" year="1951">May 26, 1951</st1:date>, when plaintiff paid its obligations under 
Credits Nos. 43729 and 41347 is <u>erroneous and without any legal basis</u> 
because the plaintiff on these dates did not purchase any foreign exchange from 
the Central Bank but merely liquidated its existing accounts under the Credits. 
The sale of foreign exchange in the Present case took place at the moment when 
the applications for Letters of Credit were approved and given due course, that 
is, on May 29, 1950 and January 2, 1951, at which time, Republic Act No. 601 
imposing a tax on the sate of Foreign Exchange was not, as yet, in existence.

</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"Defendant-appellant urges in this appeal that the lower court erred in not 
dismissing plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> complaint on the 
ground that it has prescribed.</p>
<p>"The contention is correct. It is to be noted that the excise tax law (Rep. 
Act No. 601) contains no provision regarding the period within which a taxpayer 
must bring his action to recover an excise tax erroneously or illegally 
collected. Accordingly, Articles 18 and 1149 of the New Civil <span class="GramE">Code,</span> should be applied in order to determine the said 
period. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> ."</span> 
(Underlying supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>And, on the basis of the provisions of the said Civil Code provisions, <span class="GramE">We</span> ruled that the period of prescription was five years.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="7" day="14" year="1960">July 14, 1960</st1:date>, 
however, <span class="GramE">We</span> modified the above holding in resolving the 
motion for reconsideration filed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>. So far as 
relevant, <span class="GramE">We</span> then said:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has filed a motion for 
reconsideration urging that his action was still timely because, it is argued, 
the period of prescription applicable to the case is ten (10) years from date of 
payment. To support this contention, Article 1144, paragraph (2) is cited, which 
provides:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Article 1145.—<span class="GramE">The</span> following actions must be brought 
within ten years from the time the right of action accrues:</p>
<p>'(1) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;<br>'(2) Upon 
an obligation created by law;"</p></blockquote>
<p>Since, it is claimed, the payment here was made by reason of a mistake in the 
interpretation of Republic Act 601, <span class="GramE">the</span> obligation to 
return arises by virtue of Article 2155, in relation to Article 2154 of the New 
Civil Code and is, therefore, one created by law.</p>
<p>"<span class="SpellE">Movant-appellee</span> is partly correct. However, 
Articles 2154 and 2155 relied upon, specifically refer to obligations of the 
nature of <span class="SpellE"><u>solutio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">inidebiti</span></u> which are expressly classified as 
quasi-contracts under Section 2, Chapter 1 of Title VII of the New Civil Code 
Consequently, the law regarding prescription applicable to the action herein 
involved is not Article 1144-(2) cited by <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, but 
Article 1145(2) of the New Civil Code providing:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Article 1145.—<span class="GramE">The</span> following actions must be 
commenced within six years:</p>
<p>(1) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span class="GramE">;</span><br>(2) Upon a 
quasi-contract.'"</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>That was how <span class="GramE">We</span> arrived at the 6-year prescripts 
period in the <span class="SpellE">Belman</span> case.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, what We ruled on in the <span class="SpellE">Belman</span> case 
was not the prescriptive period applicable to Republic Act No. 601, but rather, 
the prescriptive period for claims arising from an erroneous application of the 
said law. Our ruling was that since the application of Republic Act No. 601 was 
erroneous, the collection made <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> was illegal, 
and, pursuing the reasoning to its logical termination, since the collection was 
illegal, the obligation to return or refund the same would be in the nature of 
<span class="SpellE"><u>solutio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">indebiti</span></u>, which* by the Civil Code, prescribes in 6 
years.</p>
<p>The above observations, however, are not in point to the case at bar. For the 
case on hand involves not an illegal collection, but on the contrary, a proper 
and authorized collection. The plaintiff herein demands the refund not on the 
principle and consequences of <u>solution <span class="SpellE">indebiti</span></u>, but, on the authority of a positive provision 
of law, Section 3, Republic Act No. 601. Doubtless, therefore, as the Central 
Bank is truly obliged to make the refund, the obligation is a creation of law 
and not of the rules on quasi contract. Consequently, reference must be made to 
Article 1144 of the New Civil Code for the applicable prescriptive period. Under 
this last mentioned Article, the period is ten years.</p>
<p>Upon the appellant's own computation and on the basis of which it argued 
prescription, the longest period that has elapsed in respect of the various 
claims for refund by the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is 7 
years, nine months and twelve days. Obviously, therefore, on our holding here 
that the right under Section 3 prescribes in ten years, none of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim for refund has prescribed.</p>
<p>Upon the appellant's own computation, the prescriptive Periods that have 
elapsed with respect to the several causes of action in this suit, based on the 
date of payment of the foreign exchange and not from the date of exportation, 
the following:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>First cause of Action: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p>Second Cause of Action: </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>Item A--4 years, 1 month and 27 days<br>Item B--7 years, 1 month and 28 days

<p>Fifth cause of Action:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>Item A--7 years and 15 days<br>Item B--7 years and 24 days </p></blockquote>
<p>Sixth cause of action:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>Item A—7 years and 14 days</p></blockquote>
<p>Seventh cause of action:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>Item A—7 years and 12 days <br>Item B—7 years and 15 days </p></blockquote>
<p>Eight cause of action:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>Item A—6 years, 7 months and 14 days </p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ninth cause of action:</p>
<p>Item A—5 years, 2 months and 8 days </p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">In connection with the foregoing, the Court notices that the 
appellant Bank counted the prescriptive period from the date of payment or 
collection to the date of the filing of the claim for refund. In this too, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot agree. Section 3 of the law under consideration 
plainly authorizes refund only upon the exportation of the containers. 
Therefore, the period must be counted from such exportation date as it is only 
then that the right to refund accrues and prescription should be counted from 
the time the right of action accrues. </p>
<p>If, therefore, the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> right to refund could 
not have been lost by prescription even if the same had been counted from the 
date of payment of the foreign exchange, with more reason could it not have 
expired if the period were counted from the date of exportation as We here rule. 
For in all the instances material to this suit, the actual <span class="GramE">date of exportation were</span> always subsequent to the date of 
payment.</p>
<p>Finally, the appellant contends that the lower court should not have ordered 
it to make the refund inasmuch as it has already turned over to the National 
Treasurer the proceeds from the, tax collected. The appellant maintains that 
after the collections have been turned over to the National Treasurer, it could 
no longer be liable and the action for refund "should be brought against the 
entity into whose hands the tax has been delivered."</p>
<p>The last contention is barren of merit. We have already decided in the case 
of Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> de Don Pedro vs. Central Bank, 
104 Phil. 598 that suits under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 601 may be 
instituted against the Central Bank alone without the necessity of bringing in 
the National Treasurer since the latter is not an indispensable party. 
Furthermore, Section 5 of the same Act, which provides:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span> The tax imposed under section one hereof 
shall be paid to the Central Bank of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> by 
the purchaser of the foreign exchange, and the Central Bank of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
and/or its agents shall not sell any foreign exchange without the Payment of the 
said tax. <u>The refund of taxes pursuant to see-irons two and three of this Act 
shall be made by the Central Hank of the 
</u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Philippines</u></st1:place></st1:country-region>. 
The monies collected shall accrue to the General Fund in the National Treasury.

<p><span class="GramE">leaves</span> no room whatsoever for argument on the point 
raised by the appellant.</p>
<p><b>FOR ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, judgment is hereby rendered affirming in full 
the decision appealed from. The prescriptive period applicable to the case at
