				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
to annul a writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of Appeals in
CA-G. R. No. 33266-R, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> Land
Transportation <span style="">Co., Inc. vs. </span>Hon. Francisco Geronimo, et al." In a
supplemental petition subsequently filed, <span style="">pet</span>itioner, likewise, prayed that the
decision therein rendered by the Court of Appeals, two (2) days after the
commencement of the present action, be, likewise, nullified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon after the filing of this suit, we issued a writ of
preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of that of <span style="">the Court of
Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
factual background </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On April 1, 1959, the Republic of the Philippines, through the Solicitor
General, filed, with the Court of First Instance of Manila, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">petition for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> – which was docketed
as Civil Case No. 39766 of said Court – against the <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
Land Transportation Co., Inc. – hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
– and its directors, namely, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span>, Jose P.
Velez, Federico A. Reyes and Jesus P. Velez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was based upon nine (9) alleged causes of action, which, in
substance, were:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That to conceal its illegal transactions, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> falsely reconstituted its articles of incorporation
in July, 1948, by adding new purposes not originally included, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lumber concessions, cattle ranch, agriculture,
and general merchandising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Bisaya was
organized allegedly to engage solely in water and land transportation.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1948" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1948</st1:date>, its Board of Directors adopted a resolution
authorizing it to acquire 1,024 hectares of public land in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
and 10,000 hectares of timber concessions in <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place>,
in violation of Sec. 6, Act 1459.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in May, 1949, the Board adopted another
resolution to lease 2,000 hectares of past<span style="">ure land and 1,333 hectares of cattle ranch in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That from August, 1946 to 1952, the
Corporation operated a general merchandise store, a business neither necessary
nor incidental to the operation of land <span style="">and
</span>water transportation business.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it allowed Mariano <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> to act as President in 1945 to 1948
and 1953 to 1954, respectively, when at the time they did not own a single
stock.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in violation of its charter, its articles
of incorporation and the statutes, it has engaged in mining by organizing the
Jose P. Velez Coal mines, allowing <span style="">said
</span>company to use the facilities and assets of <span class="SpellE"><u>Bisaya</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span style="">it </span>imported and sold at black market prices
to <span style="">third </span>persons,
truck spare parts, the proceeds of<span style=""> </span>which sale were appropriated <span style="">by </span>respondent
<span style="">directors.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it paid its laborers salaries below the
minimum wage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it does not keep accurate stock and
transfer books and records of dividend distribution.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">all of </span><span style="">which </span><span style="">acts were allegedly committed by <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
through </span>its co-respondents, in their capacity as officers and <span style="">control</span>ling
stockholders of the corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 17, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> and its
co-respondents <span style="">–</span> hereinafter referred to as <span style="">respondents-directors </span><span style="">– </span><span style="">excluding Miguel </span><span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>,
filed a motion <span style="">to </span>dismiss the
petition upon the ground of lack of cause of action, prescription and failure
of the Solicitor General to secure the Court’s <span style="">permission, </span>as required in Section 4
of Rule 68, Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand<span style="">,</span>
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> filed an answer <span style="">praying that</span> the Solicitor General's
petition be granted,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
not <span style="">only </span><span style="">for the causes therein
alleged, in which he denied having participated in any manner whatsoever, but,
also, for </span><span style="">addi</span><span style="">tional </span>causes
alleged in said answer, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) that <span style="">stock dividends </span><span style="">were </span>issued
to respondents Manuel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> <span style="">and Jose </span>P. V<span style="">elez, </span>without giving the same benefit to other <span style="">stockholders; </span><span style="">2) that</span><span style="">, <span style="">thru
</span>respondents-directors, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bisaya</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">had </span><span style="">destroyed company payrolls, books</span> of accounts and other records;
4) that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bisaya</span></span><span style=""> had allowed Manuel </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cuenco</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">to use corporate funds, </span><span style="">facilities</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">stocks</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">for his personal benefit;
and 5) that, to cover up these irregularities, said directors had manipu</span><span style="">lated the corporate books and accounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
had set up a cross-claim against Respondents-Directors to recover from them,
for the benefit of <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>, </span><span style="">under </span><span style="">several causes of action, the aggregate sum of P4,336,701.19.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereupon <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> and Respondents-Directors moved </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">dismiss the cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
motion and the motion to dismiss the petition for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> were denied by the trial </span><span style="">court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">Then, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
and Respondents-Directors filed their answer to the petition for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> and to the cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="2"><span style="">February
 8, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, they, </span><span style="">likewise, </span><span style="">commenced, in the Supreme Court, Civil Case G. R. No. L-16593 thereof,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> for <i style="">certiorari</i>,
to annul the orders denying <span class="SpellE">Bisaya's</span> motion to
dismiss the petition for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
and the cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> was, however, dismissed by
this Court</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "the questioned orders being interlocutory."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Soon thereafter, or on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="2"><span style="">February
 23, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
hearings on the petition for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
began before a commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost two
(2) years later, or on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="2"><span style="">February 5, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> moved for
a "judgment on consent:" (1) ordering the </span><span style="">disso</span><span style="">lution of <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>; and (2) commanding the
Board of Directors of <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> to proceed with the
liquidation of </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">assets, in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General agreed to the rendition
of said judgment, subject, however, to the qualification that its
implementation "be submitted to the discretion of the lower court."
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, similarly, agreed to the rendition of
said judgment; but, he urged that a </span><span style="">receiver </span><span style="">be appointed to
wind up the affairs of <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>, and that judgment be,
likewise, rendered on his cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> moved to </span><span style="">withdraw </span><span style="">its motion for judgment on consent, upon the ground that the conditions
to which the motion was subject had not been accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
opposed said withdrawal and pressed for the appointment of a receiver, which
was, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">turn, objected to by <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Later, or on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="11"><span style="">November
 4, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> reiterated its motion to dismiss the petition for <u>quo</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>, alleging that the Court of First
Instance of Manila has no jurisdiction over the case, because <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> is domicile in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
denial of this motion, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> brought the matter,
once again, to the Supreme Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> on a petition for prohibition, docketed as
G. R. No. L-22097,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which we dismissed on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="11"><span style="">November
 15, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two weeks later, or on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="12"><span style="">December
 3, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower
court granted Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco's</span> petition for the
appointment of a receiver and directed the parties to submit their nominees <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, which they did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> announced that it
would take "steps to annul the order of receivership." In fact, on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="1"><span style="">January
 9, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> </span><span style="">filed, with the Court of Appeals, a petition </span><span style="">for <i style="">certiorari</i>
with preliminary injunction, docketed as CA-G. R. No. 33266-R, upon the theory
that the trial court had acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing said
order of </span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="12"><span style="">December 3, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="1"><span style="">January
 15, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court
of Appeals issued an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> writ of
preliminary injunction enjoining the trial </span>court <span style="">from enforcing said order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Answering the petition in
said case CA-G. R. No. 33266-R, </span>Miguel <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cuenco</span></span><span style=""> alleged that the same </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">premature, that <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning
the order complained of, and that the same is legally justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">was argued orally,
on March 13, 1963, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, likewise, moved to
dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction a the appellate court, in view of his
cross-claim for over P4,000,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">O</span><span style="">n
</span><st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="3"><span style="">March 18, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">,
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> filed a memorandum in </span><span style="">support of his
aforementioned motion to dismiss, and on</span><span style=""> </span><st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="4"><span style="">April </span><span style="">29, 196</span><span style="">4</span></st1:date><span style="">, he moved
to dissolve the writ of preliminary junction issued, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1"><span style="">January
 15, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, by the
appellate court, which denied said motion</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, commenced,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in the Supreme </span>Court, the present
action for <i style="">certiorari</i>, with
prohibition and preliminary injunction, against the Court of Appeals and the
petitioners in CA-G. R. No. 33266-R, alleging that the Court of Appeals had no
jurisdiction to issue said writ of preliminary injunction, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1964</st1:date>, and had gravely
abused its discretion in denying petitioner's motion for the dissolution of
said writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) days later, or on June 6, 1964, the Court of Appeals
promulgated its decision in CA-G.R. No. 33266-R, 1) declaring that it has
jurisdiction over the subject-matter thereof; 2) annulling the order of the
trial court of December 3, 1963, granting petitioner's motion for receivership;
3) directing said trial court to proceed with the hearing on the merits of the <u>quo</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> case; and 4) maintaining, in the
interim, the writ of preliminary injunction issued on January 15, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1964</st1:date>, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
filed with the Supreme Court a supplemental petition for the annulment of said
decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer to the original petition herein, the <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> maintained that a quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
proceeding is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation, for which reason the
appellate Court had jurisdiction over CA-G.R. No. 33266-R; that directors or
stockholders are not proper parties in such proceeding; that Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> was not, accordingly, a proper party in the trial
court; and that, as a consequence, he was not entitled to file a
cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the
subject-matter of the supplemental petition, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
alleged that the proper remedy for petitioners herein is to appeal from the
decision in CA-G.R. No. 33266-R, not this original action of <i style="">certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, we issued a writ of preliminary injunction
commanding the Court of Appeals, until further orders, to desist from enforcing
its writ of preliminary injunction against the trial Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
moved this Court to <span style="">issue </span>a writ
of preliminary injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the trial court's
order of <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1959</st1:date>,
for the appointment of a receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It,
likewise, moved, in a separate motion, that the records of CA-G.R. No. 33266-R
be ordered forwarded to this Court, "to obtain the early resolution of the
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> filed against
the order of receivership issued in the quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
case x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and, at least,
to obtain a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the enforcement of that
order of receivership."</p>

<p class="BODY">Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> objected to both motions,
whereas this Court took note of the first motion and of <span style="">the opposition </span>thereto, and deferred action on the motion for
the elevation of the records <span style="">of CA-G.R.
No. 33266-R, until the present case is taken up on the merits.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Still later <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> moved to dismiss the original petition and the
supplemental petition in the case at bar upon </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">ground that the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> and the Republic had filed, with the trial court, a motion
for judgment based on the following com</span><span style="">prom</span><span style="">ise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>respondent corporation be ordered to amend
within <span style="">six </span>(6)
months its articles of incorporation so as to exclude from its purpose clause
the operation of lumber concessions, cattle ranch, agricultural lands, and a
general merchandise store;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>respondent corporation be ordered to sell or
otherwise dispose of within <span style="">six </span>(6)
months its cattle ranch;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“c.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>respondent corporation be authorized to
continue serving the public in the field of public transportation only and to
post such bond as the appropriate court may require to secure and protect
whatever rights or claims any com­plaining stockholder, including Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, may have against the corporation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner objected to
said motion to dismiss, which this Court decided to take up "when the case
is considered on the merits." And, this is the question we now proceed to
settle, namely, should the aforementioned motion to dismiss be granted or
denied?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obvious answer is that it
should be, as it is hereby, denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not see why the
filing, with the trial court, </span><span style="">of
the </span><span style="">aforementioned motion, of <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> and Republic, for a "judgment on
compromise," should require the dismissal of present action of </span><span style="">Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> </span><span style="">against <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span> and
the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the
trial court has not as yet granted said </span><span style="">motion </span><span style="">for a
"judgment on compromise." We do </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">even know whether
said court will regard the agreement between <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
and the Republic as a compromise, considering that Miguel</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cuenco</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">party in the </span><span style="">case, </span><span style="">has not joined said
agreement and objects thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
we can not, and should not, declare </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the present case,
whether said "judgment on compromise", if rendered, </span><span style="">would </span><span style="">necessarily throw the cross-claim of Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
out of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court would have to pass upon such question, should it render
the aforementioned "judgment on compromise." Thirdly, as long and so
long as the injunction and the decision in CA-G.R. No, 33266-R are there <span style="">–</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>
does not allege that they have been wiped out by said motion for a judgment on
compromise <span style="">–</span> Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> is entitled to maintain the present action to
contest and annul said writ and decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main question for
determination by us is whether or not the appellate court had jurisdiction to
hear and decide said case CA-G.R. No. 33266-R.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner maintains that
the answer should be in the negative, because of the cross-claim for over P4
millions in the <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand,
respondents herein insist that the answer should be in the affirmative, upon
the theory that the jurisdiction of the appellate court should be determined by
the allegations of the petition for <u>q</u></span><u><span style="">uo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span><span style="">, which is incapable of pecuniary estimation,
and that a cross-claim is improper in <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents' contention
is clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is conceded
that the original jurisdiction of the appellate court to issue writs of <i style="">certiorari</i> is limited to those which are
"in aid of its appellate jurisdiction."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Excluding the cases provided for in the
Constitution and criminal cases, said appellate jurisdiction is dependent upon </span><span style="">"the value </span><span style="">in controversy." If the same exceeds
P200,000.00, exclusive of interests and costs, the case is within the appellate
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, the appellate jurisdiction is vested in the Court of Appeals.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The "value of the controversy"
is determined, however, <u>not only</u> by the complaint or petition, but,
also, by other pleadings which determine the issues in the case, such as the
answer, the counter-claim, the cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, in <span class="SpellE">Miailhe</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court took into consideration, in
determining the appellate jurisdiction over the case, not only the amount
sought to be recovered in the complaint, but, also, the amount claimed in the
counter-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the appeal may,
and often does, require a review of the "entire" controversy.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, for instance, the appellate court
declared, in its decision of June 6, 1964, that it was improper for petitioner to
file in the <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> proceedings,
his cross-claim for over P4 millions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, s</span>uch <span style="">declaration
entailed a determination of the propriety of said cross-claim which cannot be
made without exercising jurisdiction over the same, despite the admitted fact
that it is beyond the appellate jurisdiction of the </span>Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This only goes to show that the
latter can not assume jurisdiction over case CA-G.R. No. 33266-R without making
a pronouncement on said cross-claim, and, hence, without exercising jurisdiction
over the same.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lack of jurisdiction
of the Court of Appeals over said case becomes even more apparent when we
consider that the trial court had denied the motion of respondents herein to
dismiss said cross-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing
on the merits of the petition and the cross-claim, the trial court would have
to render, therefore, a decision on both.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In doing so, it may dismiss the cross-claim in its entirety, or render
judgment for the cross-claimant; either for the full amount of the cross-claim,
or for part thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either case, the
party adversely affected by the decision may appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no doubt that such appeal would
be within the exclusive jurisdiction, not of the Court of Appeals, but of the
Supreme </span><span style="">Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And such </span><span style="">would be the case, regardless of whether the cross-claim was properly
filed in the trial court or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the </span>jurisdiction based upon "the value in controversy" is not
dependent upon the <u>validity</u> of the claim or its propriety, since neither
can be passed upon without previous assumption and exercise of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the main
respondents herein must have been aware of this fact, for, otherwise, Civil <span style="">Cases L-16593 and L-22097 would not have been
instituted </span>by <span style="">them <u>in the
Supreme Court</u>, </span>to secure relief against certain <span style="">orders of the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is thus clear that the
subject-matter of CA-G.R. No. 33266-R is beyond the original jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeals, and that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the
same, as well as its decision therein rendered, are null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings therein being a patent
nullity, it would serve no useful purpose to order the records thereof elevated
to this Court.</span></p>

dismissal of the present case and for the elevation to this Court of the
records of the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals
in CA-G. R. No. 33266-R are hereby denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction
