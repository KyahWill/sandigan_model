of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental
in Criminal Case No. 9040, entitled People of the Philippines vs. Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Oñate</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Bukay</span>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the
prosecution has established the crime of murder conclusively and beyond
reasonable doubt, it appearing that the killing was attended by the qualifying
circumstance of <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the accused is hereby declared <span style="">guilty of murder, under Art. 248 of the
Revised Penal Code, and, in the absence of any mitigating or aggravating
circumstance, the penalty shall be imposed in its medium period, and he is
hereby sentenced to <span class="SpellE"><u>cadena</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span><u>,</u>

<p class="BODY">Even before the trial in the court below, appellant already
admitted having killed the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Peping</span> <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>, by proposing to plead guilty to the crime of
homicide, but this offer was rejected by the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, in this appeal, he has assigned only
two errors, namely:</p>

<p class="NUM">“I. The lower court erred in not appreciating the voluntary
surrender of the accused as a mitigating circumstance.</p>

<p class="NUM">“II. The lower court erred in holding that the stabbing of the

<p class="BODY">The obvious reason why no mention of this certification was made
in the decision of the trial court is because it does not appear that the same
was formally offered as evidence by the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can overlook such oversight as, anyway,
the Solicitor General does not impugn the genuineness and truthfulness of the
certificate and, in fact, recommends that on the basis thereof, appellant be
credited with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.)</p>

<p class="BODY">(Anent the second assignment of error, it is to be observed that
the trial judge, Hon. Jose F. Fernandez, deferred consideration of the offer of
appellant to plead guilty to the lighter offense of homicide until after he
heard the evidence of the prosecution, hence it must be presumed that His Honor
carefully weighed all relevant circumstances including the demeanor of the
witnesses who testified before him regarding the sole basic factual issue he
had to decide, namely, whether or not the admitted killing of <span class="SpellE">Peping</span> <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> by appellant was
attended by "<span class="SpellE">alevosia</span>" or treachery) After
the trial, His Honor concluded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused admits having stabbed Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1966</st1:date>,
and, announced during the trial that he was ready to plead guilty to homicide,
not murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that in the
evening of October 15, 1966, he and his companions, together with Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>, drunk 'tuba' in a 'sari-sari' store in Burgos
Street, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, but Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>
left without paying for his drink so he (<span class="SpellE">Oñate</span>) was
asked to pay for it by the storekeeper but instead he promised to collect the
amount from Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>; that while he and his two
companions were standing near the corner of <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>-Burgos
Streets, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, shortly after leaving the
store, he saw Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> walking towards the
direction of the Provincial Hospital in front of <span class="SpellE">Funeraria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> in <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> Street, so
he asked his companions to approach Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> for
the payment of the 'tuba' but his companions refused whereupon he himself
accosted Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> and demanded payment but <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> laid hands upon him, grabbing him by his collar and
pushing him back and forth until he fell to the ground, after which Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> dipped his hand into his pocket as if to fish for
something in his pocket, so, fearing for his life; he drew his knife and
stabbed Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This pretension of the accused was roundly denied by the
eyewitnesses Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tajanlangit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rebecca <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sy</span></span><span style=""> </span>stated
that she was seated in front of a store next to <span class="SpellE">Funeraria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> for she was selling 'tuba' in the evening in
question when Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> came and asked for a glass
of 'tuba' but she answered that all her 'tuba' had been consumed whereupon <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> turned around and walked towards the direction of
the Provincial Hospital; that <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> had not gone
far when she saw the accused who, without saying a word, placed his hand on the
shoulder of <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> and stabbed him with a knife
hitting him in his side and in his forehead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tajanlangit</span>, one of the two
companions of the accused in the evening in question, denied that the deceased
provoked a quarrel with the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He stated that when they saw Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> the accused asked him and his companion to approach
Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span> for his unpaid drink but he was afraid
and refused, whereupon the accused himself accosted Jose <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>
and, once close to him, suddenly stabbed the deceased in his right side and
forehead.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The record shows that the testimony of Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Tajanlangit</span> have not
been impugned nor in any manner <span class="SpellE">disproven</span> by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their <span style="">testimonies are free from any material contradiction and the accused
has not shown any motive whatsoever that these eyewitnesses were impelled by
any malicious or false motive in testifying in the manner they did.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'As appellant met the deceased walking along the street appellant
suddenly and without any warning pulled out a bolo under his shirt and with
full strength thrust it upon the body of Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernandez fled and appellant continued to
chase him and struck <span style="">him again until he
finally fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u><span style="">Held:</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">There is no doubt that the sudden attack made upon Fernandez without
any warning was accompanied by treachery thereby qualifying the killing as
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dosal</span>,

<p class="BODY">(We have read the complete transcript of the proceedings in the
trial court and carefully scrutinized the testimonies of appellant and his lone
witness Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Tobola</span>, in the light of the opposite
versions of the eyewitnesses of the prosecution <span class="SpellE">Tajanlangit</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
it does seem, as contended by counsel for appellant in his brief and in his
memorandum in the court below, rather strange and unnatural that appellant
would un­ceremoniously<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">and suddenly assault <span class="SpellE">Ventosa</span>
only because the latter left the store without paying for the "tuba"
he had drunk, thus causing the storekeeper to try to collect the P0.20 payment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> from the appellant and his companions, <span class="SpellE">Tajanlangit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cailo</span>, such apparently unusual circumstance finds
sufficient explanation in the fact that, as was shown by the prosecution thru
the testimonies of three witnesses, namely, <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arcobillas</span>, a policeman, George Valencia and Fernando
Valencia, appellant is a man prone to resorting to the use of his bladed
weapon, notwithstanding protestations made by him on the witness stand to the
contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there is
enough basis in the record for Us to rely on the conclusions of fact of the
trial court as regards the decisive issue of credibility raised by appellant in
his second assignment of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is almost
trite to reiterate that "time and again, We have held that when the issue
is one of credibility of witnesses, appellate courts will generally not disturb
the findings of the trial court, considering that it is in a better position to
decide the question, having heard the witnesses and observed their deportment
and manner of testifying during trial, unless it has plainly overlooked certain
facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the results of
the case.)</span><span style="">”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(Appellant capitalizes on some alleged discrepancies in details
between the testimonies of the physician and of <span class="SpellE">Tajanlangit</span>
as well as between that of the latter and of the other eyewitness Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">But apart from the fact that the trial judge
was </span><span style="">diligent enough to iron </span><span style="">out </span><span style="">some of the apparent discrepancies referred to, the rest of them are
related to merely insubstantial matters, which, as We have uniformly held, lend
weight rather than detract from the credibility of the evidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(There can be no doubt, therefore, as to the guilt of appellant
of the crime of murder charged, qualified by "<span class="SpellE">alevosia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he must be credited with mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender, for which reason, the Solicitor General
recommends that in lieu of the life imprisonment imposed by the trial court,
the appellant be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging
from twelve years and one day of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal,</u> </span>as minimum, to
eighteen years two months and one day of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u>,
</span>as maximum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection,
in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, 25 SCRA 468, it was held that
"(t)he penalty for murder is <u><span style="">reclusion
temporal</span></u> in its maximum period to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 248, Revised Penal Code.) There being
one mitigating circumstance, voluntary surrender, the penalty -- should be <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u> </span>in its maximum period in relation to the
Indeterminate Sentence Law'', and the sentence actually imposed by the Court
was the indeterminate penalty of from 15 years to 20 years of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal.)<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(We believe, however, that [considering the age of the appellant,
as well as other relevant factors in this case, it would be more in keeping
with the spirit and intent of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, which is "to
uplift and redeem valuable human material and prevent unnecessary and excessive
deprivation of personal liberty and economic usefulness."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Ducosin</span>,
59 Phil. 109, 117), to be guided instead by Our holding in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> Jr. et al., 31 SCRA 401,] as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . . the penalty imposable upon him is the minimum period of
the penalty for murder (see par. 3, Art. 63, Revised Penal Code), <span style="">which is </span><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u></span><span style=""> maximum (</span>17 <span style="">years, 4 months and 1 day to 20 years).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the </span>resulting penalty is neither death nor life
imprisonment, the Indeterminate Sentence Law applies (Sec. 2, Act No. 4103 as
amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> is therefore entitled to an indeterminate
sentence, the upper range of which is <u>reclusion temporal</u> maximum and the
lower range - which is one degree lower than the penalty prescribed by the
Revised Penal Code for murder - is anywhere within <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> maximum (10 years and 1 day) to <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
medium (17 years and <span style="">4 months).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty meted out </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the trial court on <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. - from </span>10 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> to 17 years 4 months and 1 day
of reclusion temporal) - is within the range allowed by law and is therefore
correctly imposed.”)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(Besides, the gap between the minimum of fifteen (15) years and
the maximum of twenty (20) years is too short.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law is intended to favor the defendant, particularly to shorten his
term of imprisonment, depending upon his behavior and his physical, mental and
moral record as a prisoner, to be determined by the Board of Indeterminate
Sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law grants the <span style="">courts discretion to fix the minimum of the
penalty to be imposed, with the limitation that it must be within the range of
the penalty next lower in degree to that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code
for the offense committed.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(</span><span style="">Thus, this Court, in People v. Gonzales,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

indeterminate penalty 'shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to
that prescribed <span style="">by the Code for the </span>offense'
and the penalty for each offense is provided by the Code without regard to circumstances
modifying criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, for purpose of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty next lower
should be determined without regard as to whether the basic penalty provided by
the Code should be applied in its maximum or minimum period as circumstances
modifying liability may require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When,
however - and this may be the only exception to the rule - the number of
mitigating <span style="">circumstances is such as to
entitle the accused to the penalty next lower in degree, this penalty, in the
application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, should be taken as the starting
point for the determination of the penalty next lower."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(The determination, however, of the minimum is not a mechanical
act of computation, but a consideration of various factors, keeping in mind the
basic purpose of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As explained
in People v. <span class="SpellE">Ducosin</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"The determination of the 'minimum' penalty presents two
aspects:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, the more or less
mechanical determination of the extreme limits of the minimum imprisonment
period; and second, the broad question of the factors and circumstances that

the ascertained limits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We come now <span style="">to </span>the
second aspect of the determination of the minimum penalty, namely, the
considerations which should guide the court in fixing the term or duration of
the minimum period of imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Keeping in mind the basic purpose of the Indeterminate Sentence Law 'to
uplift and redeem valuable human material, and prevent unnecessary and
excessive deprivation of personal liberty and economic usefulness' (Message of
the Governor-General, Official Gazette No. 92, <span style="">Vol. </span>XXXI, August 3, 1933), it is necessary to consider the criminal,
first, as an individual and, second, as a member of society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opens up an almost limitless field of
investigation and study which it is the duty <span style="">of the court </span>to <span style="">explore
in each case as far as </span>is humanly possible, with the end in view that
penalties shall not be standardized but fitted as far as is possible to the
individual; with due regard to <span style="">the
imperative necessity of protecting the social order.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the criminal as an individual, some of the
factors that should be considered are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) His age, especially with <span style="">reference
</span>to extreme youth or old age; (2) his general health and physical <span style="">condition; (3) his mentality, heredity and
personal habits; (4) his previous conduct, environment and mode of life (and criminal
record if any); (5) his previous education, both intellectual and moral; (6)
his proclivities and aptitudes for usefulness or injury to society; (7) his
demeanor during trial and hi s attitude with regard to the crime committed; (8)
the manner and circumstances in which the crime was committed; (9) the gravity
of the offense (note that section 2 of Act No. 4103 excepts certain grave
crimes - this should be kept in mind in assessing the minimum penalties for
analogous crimes).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In considering the criminal as a member of society, his
relationship, first, toward his dependents, family and associates and their
relationship with him, and seconds his relationship towards society at large
and the State are important factors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
State is concerned not only in the imperative necessity of protecting the
social organization against the criminal acts of destructive individuals but
also in redeeming the individual for economic usefulness and other social
ends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a word, the Indeterminate
Sentence Law aims to individualize the administration of our criminal law to a
degree not heretofore known in these <st1:place>Islands</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the foregoing principles in mind as
guides, the courts can give full effect to the beneficent intention of the
Legislature.")</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(It was for the purpose of giving substance to the purpose of the
law that this Court, in previous cases of murder where there was one mitigating
circumstance and no aggravating circumstances, had usually imposed upon the
accused an indeterminate penalty ranging from ten (10) years and one (1) day of
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">mayor</span></u>

The minimum of ten (10) <span style="">years and one
(1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> was set
