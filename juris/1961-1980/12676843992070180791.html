				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The City Treasurer of Manila has 
appealed directly to this Court a decision of the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Branch), 
in its Civil Case No. 2288-P, requiring said City Treasurer to accept <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> R. O. <span class="SpellE">Tirona's</span> <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate in payment of his real estate taxes for 
1962 amounting to P1,887.90.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts are not disputed. They, 
and the issues litigated, are clearly stated in the appealed decision, as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"This is a petition for mandamus 
praying that the respondent. M. <span class="SpellE">Cudiamat</span>, as City 
Treasurer of Manila, <span class="GramE">be</span> compelled to accept 
petitioner's <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate in payment of his 
realty taxes for the year 1962, effective as of the date it was presented for 
payment, i.e., June 28, 1962. The case was submitted on an agreed stipulation of 
facts with the pertinent documents as annexes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appears that the petitioner is 
the original holder of a <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate 
(Acknowledgment No. 8506) issued under Republic Ad No. 897. On June 28, 1962, he 
offered to respondent his <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate in 
payment of his realty taxes for the 1962 mi the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,887.90</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The respondent, however, did not 
accept petitioner's <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate pursuant to 
the directive issued by the City Mayor dated December 19, 1958 (Exhibit I), 
because: (a) the City of Manila received from taxpayers certificates of 
indebtedness and negotiable certificates of indebtedness during the period from 
1958 to August &amp; 1962, in the total amount of P2,103,001.32, which 
certificates had been tendered to the National Treasurer for redemption but same 
have not as yet been redeemed (Exhibit 2); (b) from 1954 to 1958 &amp; 
respondent's office had accepted in payment of real estate taxes, applications 
for the issuance of certificates of indebtedness (<span class="SpellE">Backpay</span> Form No. 3) which were forwarded to the <span class="SpellE">Backpay</span> Division Bureau of the Treasury for the issuance of 
the corresponding certificates of indebtedness in favor of the City of Manila 
but which, up to this date, have not boon issued, in the total amount of 
P1,725,115.72 (Exhibit 3); (c) the grand total of "real estate tax in payment of 
which applications for the issuance of certificates of indebtedness were 
received and placed on file" by respondent's office without accepting them due 
to the aforesaid order of the City Mayor for the period from December, 1958, to 
June, 1962, is P124,408.20 (Exhibit 4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Restating the action, respondent 
in his special and affirmative defenses alleges that (1) the petition states no 
cause of action '* * * the obligation of petitioner, not having subsided on the 
date of the approval of Act No. 897, that is, June 20, 1953, the acceptance or 
non-acceptance of the certificates of indebtedness becomes discretionary on 
respondent's part.' (2) Even assuming otherwise, mandamus does not lie since 
under the circumstances he is mot in duty bound to accept the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate. (3) To compel him to accept <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates in payment of taxes under these 
circumstances would constitute impairment of obligations of contract." (pp. 1 
and 2, Decision)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case having been decided 
adversely to him, the City Treasurer of Manila appealed to this Court on points 
of tow, insisting on the defenses already interposed by him to the court 
below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is first urged by the 
appellant City Treasurer that under section 2 of Republic Act 304, as amended, 
<span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates are admissible in payment of 
obligations subsisting on the date of approval of the said Acts, i.e. on June 
20, 1953, at the latest, being that of the approval of latest amendatory law, 
Republic Act No. 897. This stand is belied by the very text of the 
law:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 
2.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> * * * 
*<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">PROVIDED, That upon application 
and subject to such rules and regulations as may be approved by the Secretary of 
Finance a certificate of indebtedness may issue by the Treasurer of the 
Philippines covering the whole or part of the total salaries or wages the right 
to which has been duly acknowledged and recognized, provided that the face value 
of such certificate of indebtedness shall not exceed the amount wit that the 
applicant may need for the payment of (1) obligations subsisting at the time of 
the approval of this amendatory which the applicant may directly be liable to 
the government or to any of its branches or instrumentalities, * * *: (2) his 
taxes; (3) government hospital bills of the applicant; (4) lands purchased or 
leased or to be purchased or leased by him from the public domain; and (5) any 
amount received by the applicant as gratuity or pension which he has to refund 
to the Government or to any of its branches or instrumentalities; * * 
*."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It will be seen that while the 
applicability of the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate to the 
payment of holder's obligations to the government or any of its branches or 
instrumentalities is limited to those subsisting at the time of the approval of 
the amendatory act (No. 897), the statute also declares the applicability of the 
<span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates to the payment by the holder of 
"(2) his taxes; (3) government hospital bills of the applicant; * * * * * etc.," 
without any limitation in point of time. As remarked by the court below, had it 
been intended to apply to the taxes the same limitation as to time imposed upon 
the other obligations, the limitation would have been repeated or stated after 
the expression "his taxes."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant also calls attention to 
the fact that section &amp; of Republic Act 897 only refers to the application 
of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> rights of members of the Philippine Army, 
recognized guerilla forces, and officers of the Philippine Scouts to the payment 
of obligations subsisting on the date of the approval of this Act, 
"<i>notwithstanding</i> any provision of Republic <i>Act No. 304,</i> as 
<i>amended</i>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 
5.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
Notwithstanding any provision of Republic Act Three Hundred Four, as 
amended:—(1) the face value of any certificate of indebtedness which may be 
issued upon application member of the Philippine Army, a recognized guerrilla or 
an of the Philippine Scouts who may be entitled thereto, for the payment of any 
of his obligations to the Government or to any of its branches or 
instrumentalities, or the corporations owned or controlled by the Government, or 
to any citizen of the Philippines, or to any association or corporation, 
organized under the laws of the Philippines, who may willing to accept the same 
for such settlement, shall not exceed, the amount of such obligation subsisting 
on the date of approval of this Act; (2) the time limit for the filing of 
application by or for members of the Philippine Army, recognized guerilla forces 
and Philippine Scouts herein mentioned shall be one year from the date of 
approval of this amendatory Act."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reason for the exceptional 
provision in the foregoing section is readily apparent: since it was Republic 
Act 897 that extended to members of the armed and guerilla forces the benefits 
of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>, it would have been unjust to enforce upon 
them the limitations as to time, as contained in the original Republic Act 304, 
approved years before. It did not mean that the armed and guerrilla forces' 
<span class="SpellE">backpay</span> would not apply to the payment of taxes or 
hospital bills, for there is no discernible reason why members of said forces 
should be discriminated against in comparison to other <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> right holders. If other holders of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates can apply the value thereof to the 
payment of their taxes and government hospital bills, justice and equity demand 
that military holders should enjoy the same privilege. The lower court, 
therefore, correctly held that section 5, above-quoted, does not restrict the 
application of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates for the purposes 
enumerated in section 2 of Republic Act 304.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellant next advances the 
theory that under section 3 of the Act the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> is 
made an obligation of the office employing the holder of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> rights, and such office, under section 4, must 
reimburse the National government for the corresponding annual contributions to 
the sinking fund established for their redemption; whence, appellant reasons 
out, the duty to accept <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates 
corresponds to the offices that must assume ultimate payment thereof. Since 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is a member of the Armed Forces, appellant 
concludes that acceptance of his <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate 
is not a duty of the City of Manila of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. This 
is patently a strained interpretation of the law. The duty to contribute to the 
sinking fund for the redemption of the <span class="SpellE">backay</span> 
certificates is separate and distinct from the obligation to accept the 
certificates for the discharge of the obligations, taxes, hospital bills, etc., 
of the holder. The acceptance, where proper, of the certificates merely 
transfers the <i>pro <span class="SpellE">tanto</span></i> credit of the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> holder to the accepting office, or entity, and 
subrogates the latter in the right to demand ultimate reimbursement at 
maturity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It may be true that, instead of 
receiving money in concept of taxes, the effect is to compel the City of Manila 
to receive assignments of credit against the National Government, in the form of 
<span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates. Whatever unfavorable effect on 
the city finances may result from the application of the law must be deemed to 
have been intended by the legislature, which, after all, has full control over 
cities and municipalities (Manila <i>vs</i>. MERALCO, 36 Phil. 89, 
98-99).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, the proposition that 
appellant City Treasurer was only acting under the directive of the City Mayor 
is certainly unacceptable as a defense. The City Mayor can not validly 
countermand the performance of a duty enjoined by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision appealed from is 
affirmed, with costs against appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C. J., Bautista Angelo,
