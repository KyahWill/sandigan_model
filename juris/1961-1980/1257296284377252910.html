				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 5, 1955, the Mindanao Federation of Labor, together with some laid-off 
employees, filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against the Mindanao 
Motor Line, Inc., its General Manager Jesus Moraza and Resident Manager Enrique 
Ponce, as well as against Aboitiz &amp; Co., Inc., charging them with having 
interfered with the complaining employees in the exercise of their right to 
organize as guaranteed by the Magna Carta of Labor.
<p>Respondents, in their answer, stated that the Mindanao Motor Line, Inc. is a 
corporate entity distinct and separate from the Aboitiz &amp; Co., Inc., and 
that if the operation of the Cotabato-Parang-Iligan line was suspended on 
February 1, 1955, it was merely to protect the interest of the Mindanao Motor 
Line, Inc. which had incurred heavy losses in its operation, which suspension 
resulted in the laying off of the employees working on that line. They further 
averred that they never interfered with the union activities of the complaining 
employees who were laid off only for the above reason and were given due notice 
of their separation and payment of their separation pay equivalent to one month 
salary.</p>
<p>After due trial, the Court of Industrial Relations, in an order issued on 
January 4, 1961, ordered respondent Mindanao Motor Line, Inc. to pay back wages 
to the laid-off employees without reinstatement from February 1, 1955, the date 
of separation, up to and until June 10, 1953, the date prior to the cancellation 
of the certificate of public convenience covering the line that was suspended. 
The full tenor of the dispositive part of the order reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court believes that the respondents are guilty 
of the unfair labor practice as charged, thus violating Sec. 4(a), subsection 1 
and 4 of R.A. No. 875. Due to the fact that the certificate of public 
convenience of respondent Mindanao Motor Line, Inc., which has been issued for 
the operation of its TPU service has already been cancelled on June 11, 1958, as 
per Exh. '17', the respondent company is hereby ordered to Pay complainants to 
the exclusion of Antonio Actub, Orlando Siasico, Feliciano Legaspi and Nieves 
Mendoza, back wages from February 1, 1955 the day of dismissal up to and until 
June 10, 1958, the day before the cancellation of the certificate of public 
convenience without the necessity of reinstatement."</p></blockquote>
<p>Both complainants and respondents filed a motion for reconsideration of the 
above order, complainants inviting attention to the fact that, if they were to 
be accorded back wages the ones responsible would be not only the Mindanao Motor 
Line, Inc. but all the respondents jointly and severally. Both motions were 
denied. However, alleging that a clerical error has been committed in issuing 
the dispositive part of the order because not all the respondents were included 
in the payment of the pecuniary liability, the industrial court modified said 
dispositive part so as to read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * the corrected portion should read in the following manner: 'the 
respondents, Mindanao Motor Line, Inc., and/or Enrique Ponce, Aboitiz and Co. 
and/or Jesus Moraza, are hereby ordered to pay complainants to the exclusion of 
Antonio Actub, Orlando Siasico, Feliciano Legaspi and Nieves Mendoza, back wages 
from February 1, 1955 the day of dismissal up to and until June 10, 1958, the 
day before the cancellation of the certificate of public convenience without the 
necessity of reinstatement.' "</p></blockquote>
<p>Respondents again filed a motion for reconsideration, and the same having 
been denied, they interposed separately a petition for review. The petition 
filed by Mindanao Motor Line, Inc., with respondents Enrique Ponce and Jesus 
Moraza, was docketed as G. R. No. L-18418, whereas the petition filed by Aboitiz 
&amp; Co., Inc. was docketed as G. R. No. L-18419. Because of their close 
interrelation, these two petitions were consolidated in one single decision.</p>
<p>It is contended that respondents cannot be ordered to pay back wages to the 
complaining employees for the reason that the operation of the transportation 
line where they were employed has been suspended and the certificate of public 
convenience that was issued for such operation has been cancelled by the Public 
Service Commission. As a matter of fact, they contend, the reinstatement of said 
complaining employees was not ordered by the court for the same was not possible 
because the operation of the line where they were employed was never resumed. In 
short, they argue, if no reinstatement can be ordered no back wages can be 
granted because "from the phraseology of the law the payment of back wages 
presupposes an accompanying order for reinstatement." And continuing with his 
argument, counsel says: "An award for the payment of back wages necessarily 
implies reinstatement, or, at least, the possibility of reinstatement of the 
discharged employees. It is implicit then that when the court does not or can 
not order the reinstatement of employees, there is absolutely no factual or 
legal basis for the payment of back wages."</p>
<p>We disagree. While as a rule the payment of back wages follows as a necessary 
consequences an order for reinstatement, it does not follow that if 
reinstatement can not be ordered, as when the service is discontinued, the 
employees illegally laid off should be deprived of the wages they are entitled 
to, as should be the case when the company or employer is found guilty of unfair 
labor practice. This is the situation that obtains herein. The industrial court 
found respondents guilty of the unfair labor practice imputed to them and so it 
is but fair that they be paid their wages for the period they had been deprived 
of their employment.</p>
<p>We find, however, merit in the contention that respondent Enrique Ponce and 
Jesus Moraza who were included as such should not be made solidarity responsible 
for the payment of back wages, together with their employer the Mindanao Motor 
Line, Inc., for it clearly appears from the record that they were merely agents 
who acted within the scope of their corporate positions as resident manager and 
general manager, respectively, of the aforesaid company. Since they were 
impleaded merely as officers of the company and have acted only as such within 
the scope of their authority, if any one should be held responsible for the 
consequence of their acts as such officers it is their employer, unless of 
course it is shown that they have acted negligently or in bad faith. The 
evidence discloses nothing in this respect. It is a well-known principle of law 
that an agent who acts in behalf of a disclosed principal within the scope of 
his authority cannot be held liable to third persons (Article 1897, new Civil 
Code; Banque Generate Belge, et al. vs. Walter Bull &amp; Co., Inc., et al., 84 
Phil., 164; 47 Off. Gaz., 138; Zialcita-Yuseco vs. Simmons, 97 Phil., 487).</p>
<p>We also find that of the 71 employees who were laid off on February 1, 1956 
because of the alleged unfair labor practice, 31 were re-employed on other lines 
operated by the company. If this is true, which apparently is, because it is not 
denied, it is unfair to order the company to pay them back wages even during the 
period of their re-employment, for the result would be that they will receive 
double compensation during that period. The order should, therefore, be modified 
in the sense of ordering the payment of back wages only from the date of their 
separation to the date of their re-employment.</p>
<p>We likewise notice that the industrial court did not make any provision 
relative to the set-off or compensation of whatever wages or earnings the 
complaining employees may have obtained during the period of their separation, 
which omission should be rectified, for, as this Court has aptly said, "In 
estimating the damages in an action of this character for the period of time 
already past the employer may show in mitigation of damages that the discharged 
employees obtained renumerative employment elsewhere or that in the exercise of 
due diligence he might have obtained such employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>Finally, we find no merit in the contention that respondent Aboitiz &amp; 
Co., Inc. should not have been included as such not being the operator nor 
financier of the Mindanao Motor Line, Inc., for there is enough evidence on 
record to show the connection between the two companies. In the first place, 
having been included as respondent, Aboitiz &amp; Co., Inc. did not file any 
answer denying the acts constituting the unfair labor practice charged one of 
which is the fact that the Land Transportation Division of Aboitiz &amp; Co., 
Inc., of which Jesus Moraza is the general manager, controls and supervises the 
management and operation of the Mindanao Motor Line, Inc. In the second place, 
the record of the case discloses that the central office of the Mindanao Motor 
Line, Inc. and the office of the Aboitiz &amp; Co., Inc. are located in the same 
place and have the same postal address, namely, P.O. Box 65. It also appears 
that the thing that sparked the separation of the complainants is the letter of 
one Ramon Aboitiz, apparently the manager of Aboitiz &amp; Co., Inc., where it 
is shown that said company has suffered a heavy loss because of the funds it had 
advanced to the Mindanao Motor Line, Inc., for which reason he recommended that 
the operation of the line in question be suspended. Indeed, the following 
argument advanced by the counsel of respondent court is very impressive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that Ramon Aboitiz admits that the Aboitiz &amp; Company 'had 
advanced the funds, * * *' for the operation of respondent Mindanao Motor Line, 
Inc.; The fact that he had even decided for Aboitiz &amp; Company to discontinue 
this financial assistance; and the further fact that the common principal 
address of the principal actors responsible in the dismissal of 
respondent-workers herein is P.O Box 65, Cebu City, all show that Aboitiz &amp; 
Company, as alleged in the complain a quo, controls and supervises the 
management and operation of respondent Mindanao Motor Line, Inc. These facts 
were dug out from the records of the case a quo to show how truly 
<i>unfounded</i> is petitioner-appellant's claim that there is a '* * * total 
and complete absence of any evidence supporting this charge; * * *.' 
"</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the order of respondent court dated March 8, 1961 is hereby 
amended with regard to the following respects: (1) the 31 employees who were 
re-employed should be given back wages only from February 1, 1955, the day of 
dismissal, up to the date they were re-employed; (2) respondents Enrique Ponce 
and Jesus Moraza should not be made responsible for the back wages that were 
ordered paid to the complaining employees; (3) respondent companies are hereby 
authorized to set off from the back wages they were ordered to pay whatever 
earnings the complaining employees may have obtained during the period of their 
separation. In all other respects, the said order is hereby affirmed. No 
pronouncement as to costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,
