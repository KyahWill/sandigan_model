				<H3>FRANCISCO ABELLA, COMPLAINANT VS. ARLENE WALO, RESPONDENT.<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This administrative case was brought about by a letter dated April 30, 1974 of the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of Laguna (Sta. Cruz), Francisco S. Abella, transmitting to this Court the daily time record of respondent Arlene Walo, janitor-gardener, without verification by the said Clerk of Court.&nbsp; The reason given for the lack of verification is as follows:<br><blockquote>“… The same can not be verified due to the fact that Mr. Walo spends his office hours in portions of this court house where his presence or absence can not be detected by his immediate superiors or by the undersigned:&nbsp; our second floor premises, or in our rear rooms or corridors, and not in the ground floor session hall where he has been told to stay for work assignments during the day.&nbsp; At his place of work, which is our grounds, he can not be found and very little official duty is performed by him, if any, equivalent to approximately fifteen minutes a week, in lieu of the daily sweeping of the litter from our grounds, cutting of grass and cultivation of ornamental plants…”</blockquote>The respondent was required to explain; thereafter the matter was referred to the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, Honorable Maximo A. Maceren, for investigation and report.&nbsp; The record of the investigation shows that the respondent expressly admitted the statements in the letter of the Clerk of Court concerning his failure to properly perform his duties as janitor-gardener, and promised to reform himself and perform his duties more faithfully thenceforth.<br><br>In view of such admission, and considering the nature of the respondent's dereliction, the Court finds him guilty and RESOLVES to impose upon him a fine equivalent to one-half (½) month's pay, with a warning that any similar nonfeasance or misfeasance on his part will be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Let a copy of this decision be entered in the service record of the respondent.<br><br><i>Castro, (Chairman), Teehankee, Makasiar, Esguerra,</i> and <i>Muñoz Palma, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
