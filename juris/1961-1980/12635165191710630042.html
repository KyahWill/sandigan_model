school supplies and equipment, including the General Sales Supply Co., </span><span style="">Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In due course of
investigation, examiner Robles found out that the records and books of account
of the General Sales Supply Co., Inc., showed that the purchases and expenses
reported in its income tax returns had been padded and did not correctly state
the taxes due the g<span style="">o</span>vernment in </span>the
total sum of<span style=""> </span>P108<span class="GramE">,557.90</span> including the 5% surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the aforesaid findings of
examiner Robles, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on <st1:date year="1951" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1951</st1:date>, sent a letter of demand to the
corporation requiring it to pay the deficiency income taxes for the taxable
years 1946 to 1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proper assessment
notices were issued to the corporation on <st1:date year="1951" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1951</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1951" day="14" month="4"><span style="">April
 14, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">, the corporation
protested the assessment and requested for a reinvestigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was granted and on </span><st1:date year="1952" day="22" month="5"><span style="">May 22,
 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue notified the defendant corporation to submit
within 20 days from notice a list of all its general and miscellaneous expenses
as well as its various local purchases duly supported by vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corporation requested further extensions
of time within which to submit vouchers and other records to substantiate its
allegation that the deficiency tax assessment was incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These requests for extensions were dated June
10, August 9, September 9, October 9 and </span><st1:date year="1952" day="8" month="11"><span style="">November </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1952</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1952" day="15" month="12"><span style="">December
 15, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
corporation submitted a detailed</span> statement of merchandise purchased for
the years 1946 to 1949 without the vouchers and invoices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the re­peated failure on the part
of the General Sales Supply Com­pany to submit the required vouchers and
invoices, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on <st1:date year="1954" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1954</st1:date>, <span style="">wrote </span>the corporation a letter reiterating the demand for the
pay­ment of the original assessment dated <st1:date year="1951" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1951</st1:date>, including <span style="">the accrued </span><span style="">interests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
</span><st1:date year="1954" day="20" month="4"><span style="">April 20, </span><span style="">1954</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
corporation again requested for </span>a reconsideration of the assessment,
which request was granted, and a reassessment was conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on the evidence submitted during the
reassessment, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue modified his assessment
against the <span style="">corporation
by reducing the previous total assessment of </span>P108<span class="GramE">,557.90</span>
to P79,379.69.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assessment notice was
duly served upon the corporation on <st1:date year="1955" day="12" month="3">March
 12, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, the
corporation was not satisfied with the reduction and on <st1:date year="1956" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1956</st1:date>, it protested anew the latest
assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="15" month="3"><span style="">March 15, </span>1957</st1:date>,
the corporation reiterated its protest and inter­posed the defense of
prescription under Sec. 51 (d) of the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue replied, advising the corporation
that the applicable provision of law was that provided for in Section 332 (a)
of the Tax Code and not Section 51 (d) of <span style="">the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
<span style="">Commissioner </span><span style="">insisted on </span>the payment of the
assessment of <st1:date year="1955" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1955</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the refusal of the corporation to pay, the present
suit was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila in the name of the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as plaintiff, to recover from the defendant corporation the amount of P79<span class="GramE">,379.69</span> as deficiency income taxes due from defendant
corporation, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">1946 ..................................................</span>
<span class="GramE">P <span style="">&nbsp;</span>2<span style="">,850.36</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">1947 ..................................................</span></span><span style=""> </span>P26<span class="GramE">,290.59</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">1948 ..................................................</span>
P15<span class="GramE">,593.27</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">1949 ..................................................</span>
P34<span class="GramE">,645.46</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The complaint also alleged that the defendant corporation was
liable for the payment of 5% surcharge (fraud pe­nalty) under Section 72 of the
National Internal Revenue Code because it overstated its purchases and
manipulated its books of accounts purposely to evade the payment of taxes due
from it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Instead of answering the
complaint the defendant corporation filed a motion to dismiss solely based on
the ground that the deficiency income taxes sought to be collected were
assessed beyond the 3-year period prescribed by law (Sec. 51[d], Tax
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, defendants filed
their answer which was sub­sequently amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the issues were joined, the parties proceeded to trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff presented its evidence, oral
and documentary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was
presented by the defendants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1961</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered judgment holding that the right of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to assess and col­lect the deficiency taxes from
the appellants for the years 1946 to <span style="">1949
</span>has not prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
ordered the<span style=""> plaintiff to pay the total
amount of P79<span class="GramE">,379.69</span> plus 5% surcharge and 1% monthly
interests from </span><st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="4"><span style="">April 15, </span><span style="">1955</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">until fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants filed a motion for
reconsideration and for a new trial alleging that they were deprived of their
day in court and that the lower court erroneously admitted some exhibits
presented during the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion
for reconsideration and new trial was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There </span><span style="">is no </span><span style="">question that the tax imposed upon the ap­pellant corporation in the
amount of P79<span class="GramE">,379.69</span> is correct, final and
conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the appellant
questioned the assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
they did not appeal the decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to the
Court of Tax Appeals to assail the correctness of the assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It is </span><span style="">the Court of Tax
Appeals which has the original and exclusive jurisdiction to entertain cases
involving disputed assessments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 7,
Rep. Act No. 1125.) Having failed to appeal the tax assessment to the Court of
Tax Appeals within the time provided by law, the same became final and
collectible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only cases involving
the collection of taxes which fall within the jurisdiction of the regular
courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The remaining
interrelated issues may be crystallized into two main problems:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, had the action for collection off the
deficiency income taxes prescribed; </span><span style="">second, </span><span style="">were the
defendants deprived of their day in court?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants contend that
the deficiency income tax assessment for 1946 to 1949, inclusive, having been
issued on March 19, 1955, is illegal on two <span style="">grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) </span>It was made
beyond the three-year period prescribed in Section 51 <span style="">(d) </span>of the Internal Revenue Code and (b) the action was not
instituted within five years as provided by Section 331 of the same Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 51 (d) of the Tax
Code prior to its </span><span style="">amendment </span><span style="">by Republic Act No. <span class="GramE">2343,</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Supreme Court has
repeatedly held that the prescriptive period of three years in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provi­sion of the Internal Revenue Code refers
to summary collection of taxes by <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and
levy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Collector of Internal Revenue vs.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is to be observed that

<blockquote>"The period of three years prescribed in said Section 51 (d)
refers to the assessment for the purpose of 'immediate' collection of the tax
due, that is to say, by summary pro­ceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The manner by which the
Republic proceeded to collect the deficiency tax in the instant case was by
judicial action, not by summary proceedings; hence, Section </span><span style="">51 (d) </span><span style="">of the Tax Code relied upon by the appellants is not applica­ble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither will Section </span><span style="">331 </span><span style="">of the Internal Revenue Code apply.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The opening clause of said section itself warrants the institution of
the present suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 331.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Period</u> <u>of</u> <u>limitation</u>

five </span>years after the return was filed, and no proceeding in court without
assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after expiration of
such period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the pur­poses of this
section, a return filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing
thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We stress the first
statement which reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">"Except as </span><span style="">provided in the succeeding </span><span style="">section," </span><span style="">and the succeeding section clearly provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no doubt that </span><span style="">the income tax </span><span style="">returns filed by the appellant corporation were false and fraudulent
with the intent to evade payment of taxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, under Section </span><span style="">332 </span><span style="">of the Tax Code, the 10-year prescriptive
period within which to file action in court shall commence <span class="GramE">not
from the filing of the income tax returns nor</span> from the assessment of the
tax but from the "discovery of the falsity, fraud </span><span style="">or omission." </span><span style="">We said so in the case of Collector of In­</span><span style="">ternal </span>Revenue <span style="">vs. Aurelio P.
