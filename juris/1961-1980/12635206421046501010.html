				<H3>IN RE-PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP,
KAW SENG, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS.
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT-APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Solicitor General seeks the reversal of a decision of the
Court of First Instance of Iloilo granting the petition for naturaliza­tion of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Kaw</span> <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several grounds have been invoked in support
of the stand taken by the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Insofar as this appeal is concerned, it will suffice to consider one
only.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has not filed the declara­tion of intention required in section 5 of Com. Act
No. 473, upon the ground that he had continuously resided in the Philippines
for over thirty years, or since 1916, and that he is, accordingly, exempt from
such requirement under section 6 of said Act, as amended by Com. Act No. 535,
the pertinent part of which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"Persons born in the Philippines and have received their
primary and secondary education in public schools or those recognized by the
Gov­ernment and not limited to any race or nationality, and those who have
resided <u>continuously</u> in the Philippines for a period of thirty years or more
before filing their application, may be naturalized without having to make a
declaration of intention upon complying with the other requirements of this
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To such requirements shall be <u>added</u>
that which establishes that the applicant has <u>given primary and secondary
education</u> to <u>all</u> his children in the <u>public</u> schools or in
private schools recog­nized by the Government and <u>not limited to any race or
nationality</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted, however, that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had gone to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and stayed there from eight (8) to nine (9) months, in 1921; ten (10<span class="GramE">)months</span> in 1927; eight (8) months in 1932; and four (4)
months in 1946.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, his children
were enrolled in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Commercial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
thus failing to evince a sincere desire to identify him­self and his family
with the local community and to embrace the customs, traditions and ideals of
the Filipino people.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the present case falls squarely within the purview of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> See v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in which it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"Another requirement to exempt an appli­cant for
naturalization from filing the notice of intention to apply for Philippine <span class="GramE">citizenship,</span> is that the residence of the applicant in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
must be continuous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner at
bar was absent having gone to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on the following years and for so many months:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1941, five months; 1946, three months; 1956, two months; 1958, two
months; and 1959, two months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
apparent purpose of the petitioner in going to <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>
was to visit his family and children who were living in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or in <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An applicant who has left the Philippines so many times and stayed
outside for so long periods of time to visit his family outside the
Philippines, cannot be considered as having resided in the Philip­pines
continuously as required by Section 5 of the Naturalization Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Owing to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> absence from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for longer periods of time than those of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> See, and
to the enrolment of his children in Chinese schools, it is clear that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> cannot avail of the benefits of section 6 of our
amended Naturalization Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
explains why he did not even file a brief in the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, reversed, and another one entered dismissing the petition for naturalization
of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Kaw</span> <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>, with costs against him.</p>
