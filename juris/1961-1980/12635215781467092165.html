				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction, the <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> Villanueva
Transportation Co., Inc. seeks to annul the decision of the Public Service
Commission in case 69-329 granting the respondent Hector G. <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>
a certificate of public con­venience to operate a 20-unit taxi service in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City and from that city to any point in the island
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner also prays for a trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> of the said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Deprivation of due process of law is asserted against the Com­mission,
in the sense that it rendered the decision in dispute without a hearing on the
petitioner's motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
counterplea, it is claimed that the said motion does not show proof of service,
nor does it contain any notice of the time and place of hearing, and, there­fore,
is a mere scrap of paper (citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Manakil</u></span><u>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that on <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Moya</span> filed an
application with the Commission to operate a taxicab service in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and to any point in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>island</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Negros</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appli­cation, with due notice, was set
for hearing on March 31, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">At 8:00 o'clock in the morning of March 31, 1969, the peti­tioner
filed with the receiving section of the Commission a "Motion to
Dismiss" the application of <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner therein alleged that the
applicant is a holder, by purchase, of a franchise to operate taxicabs in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City the express terms of which prohibit the holder
thereof from applying for additional units during the lifetime of such
franchise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the lower left-hand corner
of page 2 of the foregoing motion the following words appear:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Copy furnished Atty. Jesus <span class="SpellE">Torrecareon</span>, for Applicant." As already stated, the
motion does not contain any notice of the time and place of hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the initial hearing on the morning of March 31, 1969, before
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Josue</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span>,
the counsel of the petitioner and the attorney of a certain Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tanedo</span> entered their respective appearances for two <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
hearing was, however, post­poned, apparently upon motion of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, as may be gleaned from the transcript of the
stenographic notes taken on that date which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We are asking for postponement and we are going to file our
opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"COMMISSION:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Case postponed until further assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Counsel for <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> are</span> given five (5) days from today to
file their written opposition after which we shall set this case for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Case delegated to Hearing
Officer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The counsel for the petitioner did not notify Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span> at the said hearing that he had filed a motion to
dismiss the application of <span class="SpellE">Moya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the said motion was, at that time,
not yet attached to the record of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither the petitioner nor the counsel of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tanedo</span> ever filed any written opposition to <span class="SpellE">Moya's</span> application.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1969</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Moya</span> filed an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
motion to set his application for hearing at the earliest possible time,
alleging the lack of any written opposition thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The officer assigned to hear the case then set it for hearing on <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1969</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner was not notified of this
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1969</st1:date>
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span> rendered the decision in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, by <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="9">September
 3, 1969</st1:date>, a copy of the petitioner's motion to dismiss was already
attached to the record of the questioned application, as the said decision of
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span> made specific reference thereto,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, it should be noted that there is attached
to the records of this case a 'Motion to Dismiss' filed by Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> dated <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this
motion was received by this <span class="SpellE">sala</span> several days after
the initial hearing on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be observed that the said 'Motion
to Dismiss' does not show any proof of service to the adverse party, applicant
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did <span class="GramE">counsel</span>
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> mention this fact in open Court on said
date to give due notice to the applicant and to the Commission that <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> intended to raise a prejudicial question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of counsel for <span class="SpellE">oppositor's</span>
non-compliance with the rudimentary rules of procedure embodied in Section 6,
Rule 15 of the Rules of Court designed to protect the substantial rights of
party litigants, the Commission cannot take cognizance nor even consider the
aforemen­tioned 'Motion to Dismiss.' (This ruling follows the policy laid down
by the Supreme Court in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Manakil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tison</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tuaño</span>, 42 Phil. 81; Roman Catholic Bishop of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> vs. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Unisan</span>,
44 Phil. 866; and many others).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
case is, therefore, deemed and declared uncontested."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Public Service Commission correctly ruled that the peti­tioner's
motion to dismiss was but a mere scrap of paper, pursuant to the doctrine laid
down and reiterated by this Court in the cases cited in the Commission's
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said motion admittedly contained, on its face, the
words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Copy furnished: Atty. Jesus
<span class="SpellE">Torrecareon</span>, for Applicant"; however, the
counsel of <span class="SpellE">Moya</span> denies that a copy of the said motion
was ever furnished him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner,
on the other hand, has not proved that it had served a copy thereof on <span class="SpellE">Moya's</span> counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the said motion does not contain any notice of the time or
place of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did the petitioner
inform Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span>, at the initial hearing on
the application, of the fact of the filing of the said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had counsel for the petitioner called the commissioner's
attention, the defect in the petitioner's motion could probably have been
cured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as the facts of this case
disclose, the petitioner preferred to sit down and wait until long after the
application of <span class="SpellE">Moya</span> was granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">To make matters worse, the transcript of stenographic notes taken
on March 31, 1969 shows that a request for additional time within which to file
written oppositions was made by the counsels of the two <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
who entered their appearance on that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the counsel for the petitioner refuses to admit having ever made
that request, this denial is belied by the mentioned record of the
proceedings:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao</span> clearly addressed both counsels for <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in granting the said request for postpone­ment,
thereby showing unmistakably that both <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
moved for the postponement of the hearing to give them time to file their
written opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cadiao's</span> order granting the said request reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Case postponed until further assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Counsel for <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> are</span> given five (5) days from today to
file their written oppositions after which we shall set this case for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Case delegated to Hearing
Officer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is well for advocates to understand and remember the clear and
uncomplicated rules concerning the filing, service and proof of motions and
other pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These rules, which are
meant to secure to every litigant the adjective phase of due process of law,
apply to proceedings before the Public Service Commission, in the absence of
different and valid statutory or administrative provisions pres­cribing the
ground rules for the investigation, hearing and adjudi­cation of cases before
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cf. <span class="SpellE"><u>Sambrano</u></span><u>
vs. PSC</u>, GR 45503, Sep­tember 20, 1938, 66 Phil. 193)</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, there have been instances where absence of strict
compliance with rules of procedure was not considered fatal to an erring
party's cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the matter of
defectively filed motions, for instance, we had occasion to so rule in a number
of cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sunga</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> </u>(G.R.
No.</span> L-26055, April 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 393), no notice of the motion to
dismiss was served by the defendant on the plaintiffs, but because the trial
court, upon learning of this fact, promptly re-set its hearing to another day
with due notice to all the parties, we held that this action of the court cured
what­ever defect there initially was so as to effectively bar the running of
any period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Sun <span class="GramE">Un</span>
<span class="SpellE">Giok</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Matusa</span></u> (G.R.
No. L-10304, May 31, 1957, 101 Phil. 727), although the motion to dismiss was
defective due to the <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> failure to specify the
date when the motion was to be heard, this Court held that the said defect was
cured when the trial court notified the plaintiff that the motion would be
heard at some future date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <u>De <span class="SpellE">Rapisura</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Rapadaz</span></u>
(G.R. No.</span> L-22594, April 29, 1966, 16 SCRA 798), the admission by the
other party of her receipt of the motion for reconsideration was held to have
cured the failure of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> to attach to his
motion the requisite proof of service.</p>

<p class="BODY">These cases show the attendance of certain circumstances which
were considered substantive enough to truncate the adverse literal application
of the pertinent rules violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
similar or identical justifying circumstance, however, can be invoked in
relation to the present recourse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the rules have to be applied however harsh the results may
be upon the erring party.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the present petition is dismissed, at
petitioner's cost.</p>
