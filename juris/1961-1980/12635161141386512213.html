<p class="BODY">Subsequently, or on June 25, 1960 to be exact, defen­dant Yap
perfected his intended appeal in both civil cases to the Supreme Court with the
approval of the record on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">On February 26, 1965, this Court promulgated its decision<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

Mindanao Academy, Inc., instead of the plain­tiff stockholders. <u>In all other
respects the judgment appealed from is affirmed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pro­nouncement as to costs."
(Stressed for empha­sis)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, plaintiffs in Civil Case 1907 only filed on July 25,
1965, a motion for the satisfaction of all mo­ney judgments against defendant
Yap alleging that out of a total award of P42<span class="GramE">,460.75</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
defendant had paid only the sum of P32,400.00 thus still leaving an unsatisfied
balance of P10,060.75. Over appellant's opposition, the lower court on
September 3, 1965, granted the motion but direc­ted that appellant should only
deposit the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,935.00</span> as the legal interest on
the total amount of rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request
for attorney's fees was denied pursuant to the Supreme Court decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs and defendant subsequently moved for re­consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, on October 1, 1965, de­nied
both motions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs pressed further with a second motion to reconsider
praying that appellant be ordered to pay the sum of P8<span class="GramE">,748.00</span>
representing the legal interests that had accrued since July 31,,1956 pursuant
to the court order of May 14, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
appellant's opposition again, the lower court on October 21, 1965, granted
plaintiff's mo­tion and ordered appellant to deposit the sum of P8<span class="GramE">,740.30</span> as legal interest within three days from
notification.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this direct appeal by appellant Yap question­ing the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo's</u> orders of September 3, 1965, October 1, 1965 and October
21, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is appellant's principal
submission that the judgment in Civil Case 1907 which be­came final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> did not provide for payment of legal interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant would have this Court overlook and disregard the lower court's
or­der of May 14, 1960 which expressly amended and modified the judgment
rendered on March 31, 1960 by directing the former to pay legal interest
starting July 31, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court's
authority to modify its judgment is not chal­lenged and it cannot be challenged
for the modification was made before the appeal was perfected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, this order of <st1:date year="1960" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1960</st1:date> was even included in the record on
appeal submitted in G.R. No. L-17681-82 hut appellant failed to raise any
question regarding the same in said case, although he should have done so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs, as the prevailing parties, could
not be expected to raise any question re­garding the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would also refer this Court to <span class="SpellE">Cordovero</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span>, 46 Phil. 473 and Robles v. <span class="SpellE">Timario</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-13911, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 28, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> in support of the proposition that there was no effective
modification of the original judgment since the lower court never set aside nor
revoked the same.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We know of no
rule requiring that when a court partially reconsiders its judgment, which is
not yet final or sub­ject of a perfected appeal, the former judgment must first
be totally revoked and a new judgment be rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither are <span class="GramE">We</span>
impressed by the cases cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Cordovero</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span>, it was
ruled, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that where a new
trial is granted, the former decision must be revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, no new trial was granted
for none was sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sustaining
plaintiffs' motion to reconsider, the lower court therefore did not have to
revoke totally its former judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Robles v. <span class="SpellE">Timario</span>, the judgment of the lower court,
which inadvertently omitted the imposition of inte­rest, had already become
final and it was only in the or­der of execution that attempt was made to cure
the over­sight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court ruled there
that said oversight should have been cured prior to the finality of the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, however,
the judgment was modified prior to the perfection of the appeal, and while the
lower court still had control over said judgment.</p>
