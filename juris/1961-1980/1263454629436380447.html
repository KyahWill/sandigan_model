(Civil Case No. 47) was filed on January 16, 1957 by <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span>
A. de <span class="SpellE">Obias</span> and her husband <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Obias</span> against Simeon <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>,
Juan Rubio, Juan <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>, Patricia <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tolero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nemesia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Santelices</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Santelices</span>, Jr., Victor <span class="SpellE">Adalla</span>, Catalina <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span> and
Ruben <span class="SpellE">Dacer</span>, in the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Garchitorena</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court
decided against defendants <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>, et al. Appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was taken by said defendants, to the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed therein as Civil Case
No. 3991.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of the appealed case
was sent by the clerk of court to the defendants themselves, not to their
lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs spouses <span class="SpellE">Obias</span>, alleging
failure at defendants to answer, moved to have them declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="5">May
 4, 1959</st1:date>, after hearing, the Court of First Instance rendered
judgment against defendants in default.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the court issued a writ of execution, but the judgment was
not fully satisfied because the defendants refused to vacate the premises as
ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this refusal, they were
charged with con­tempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending the contempt charge, the court issued, upon motion of
plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span> A. de <span class="SpellE">Obias</span>
and the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Obias</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> a
special of demolition, defendants 30 days from <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1962</st1:date> to demolished their houses, otherwise the
matter will be placed into the sheriff’s hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After obtaining an extension of 15 days, defendants on <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="9">September 5,1962</st1:date> filed before the same
court a complaint for the annulment of the judgment in Civil Case No. 3991 with
a petition ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction (Civil Case No. T-7), against <span class="SpellE">Basilisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Obias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> Rocha, Rosario
<span class="SpellE">Obias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Obias</span>, (heirs of <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Obias</span>) and the
Provincial Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day,
sustaining the allegations of nullity of the judgment in Civil Case No. 3991
because notice of the appealed case was sent to <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>,
at al. instead of their counsel, and that irreparable injury would result due
to the threatened demolition, the Court of First Instance in Civil Case No.T-7
enjoined <span class="SpellE">Obias</span>, at al. from executing the decision in
Case No. 3391.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>
et al. were required to post a bond of P500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="10">Octobers 9, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Obias</span> et al. moved to dismiss and set aside the order
and writ of preliminary injunc­tion in Civil Casa No. T-7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the objection of <span class="SpellE">Cor­dovis</span>
et al., the Court, of First Instance on January 18,1963 dismissed the complaint
and dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs in Civil Case No. T­-7 <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span>, et al., thereupon appealed to Us directly upon
questions purely of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of Rule 40 of the old Rules of Court (also Sec. 7 of
Rule 40 of the Revised Rules) in connection with appeals from the inferior
counts to the Courts of First Instance provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon the docketing of the cause under appeal, the complaint
filed in the Justice of the Peace or municipal court shall be considered
reproduced in the Court of First Ins­tance and it shall be the duty of the
clerk of court to notify the parties of that fact by registered mail, and the
period for making an answer shall begin with the date of the receipt of such
notice by the defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1953" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1953</st1:date>
Supreme Court, interpreting this provision, held that notice of the appealed
case to the parties was sufficient.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In 1962 however, in the case of Elli v. <span class="SpellE">Ditan</span>, G.R.
No. L-17444, June 30, 1962, the provision, ta­ken in conjunction with Sec. 2 of
Rule 27 of the old Rules (now Sec. 2 of Rule 13 of the Revised Rules) providing
for service of pleadings motions, etc., was held to require that notice of the
appealed ease to the par­ties themselves is properly only if the parties are
not represented by counsel; so that the moment attorney appears for the
parties, the notice should be sent to the attorney, otherwise there is no legal
service and there can be no default.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span> et al. argue that
the judgment of default rendered was a nullity because the notice of the
appealed case was sent to them not to their counsel, and cite the ruling in
Elli v. <span class="SpellE">Ditan</span>, supra, as the rule to follow, being
allegedly the most recent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention must fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the
notice of the appealed case was sent to <span class="SpellE">Cordovis</span> et
al., the doctrine prevailing was the rule in Ortiz v. Mania, supra, promulgated
in 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the <span class="SpellE">Ditan</span>
case was promulgated in 1962, the judgment in <span class="SpellE">CiviI</span>
Case No. 3991 had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And moreover, the <span class="SpellE">Ditan</span>
case was abandoned in Valenzuela v. <span class="SpellE">Balayo</span>, G.R. No. L-18748,
March 30, 1963 where We held that notice of the appealed case sent to parties
themselves, even represented by counsel, is proper, stating that the reason
“lies in the fact that on an appeal from an inferior court, only the complaint
in the justice of the peace court is deemed reproduced, and the proceeding
immediately following the filing of the complaint is the summoning of the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, however, of being
sum­moned, he is only personally notified because is ready within the court's
jurisdiction, the notice taking the place of the summons.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> </p>
