owing to the common issues therein raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants herein, the Manila Port Service (hereinafter re­ferred
to as MPS) and/or the Manila Railroad Company — or vice-versa — are defendants
in these cases, as operators of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service
in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are sued for damages to and/or loss of
goods consigned to the plaintiffs or their <span class="SpellE">subrogors</span>
or as­signors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts pertinent to
each case are:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">1. G.R. No. L-23444 (PECO vs.
MPS)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine Education Co., Inc. (PECO) was the con­signee of
one-hundred five (105) packages of books and magazines shipped on board
"SS Susan <span class="SpellE">Maersk</span><span class="GramE">, "</span>
under Bill of Lading No. 147.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the
one-hundred four (104) packages discharged unto the de­fendants' custody, only
ninety-seven (97) packages – thirty (30) of them in bad order condition – were
delivered to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirteen
(13) of said thirty (30) packages were damaged on board the carrying vessel –
whose representative paid the correspond­ing indemnity – and seventeen (17)
while in defendants' custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
provisional claim, filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="5">May 21,
 1960</st1:date>, two (2) days after the discharge of the last package, was
followed, in October 1960, by a formal claim for P921.64, later reduced to
P528.41, the CIF value of the packages short delivered, the invoice value of
which was P287.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, as in
the other six (6) cases involved in this joint decision, the value of the goods
was not stated in the shipping manifest or in the bill of lading, and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges were paid on the basis of weight or
measurement, mot of said value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City
Court of Manila, in which the case was initiated, having rendered judgment for
the plaintiff in the sum of P528.41, with interest thereon at the legal rate,
from the filing of the com­plaint (on May 16, 1961) until fully paid, and P100
as attorney's fees, apart from the costs, the defendants appealed to the Court
of First Instance of Manila, with the same result, except as to the attorney's
fees, which were increased to P200.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">2. G.R. No. L-23521 (Malayan
Insurance vs. MPS)</p>

<p class="BODY">As marine-insurer-<span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> of two (2)
consignees, the Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. filed, with the Court of First In­stance
of Manila, on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1963</st1:date>,
a complaint setting up five (5) causes of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first was for the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,287.69</span>

Mart." The last discharge took place on <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1962</st1:date>, and the correspond­ing provisional claim
was filed eight (8) days later, or on Jan­uary 26.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second was for the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,947.42</span>
paid by the plain­tiff for seven (7) damaged packages of auto parts identically
con­signed, under Bill of Lading No. 299, covering forty-nine (49) such
packages, shipped on board the same vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The corres­ponding provisional claim was filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1962</st1:date>, seven (7) days after the last
discharge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third was for the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,363.28</span>
paid by the plaintiff for four (4) similarly damaged packages, consigned to <span class="SpellE">Dupro</span>, Inc., under Bill of Lading No. 144, covering
fifty-seven (57) packages shipped on board the "SS Pioneer Mill." The

four (4) damaged bundles of galvanized steel sheets consigned to <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Chaco &amp; Sons, Inc., under Bill of Lading No. 2-A,
cover­ing thirty-eight (38) bundles of said goods, shipped on board "SS
Philippine President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>." The corresponding
provisional claim, filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="1">January
 31, 1962</st1:date>, three (3) days after the last discharge, was followed, on
<st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1962</st1:date>, by a formal
claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the trial court sentenced the defendants to,
jointly and severally, pay to the plaintiff P10<span class="GramE">,997.65</span>
-- represent­ing the aggregate sum paid by the plaintiff to the respective con­signees
– in addition to the costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">3. G.R. No. L-23522 (PECO vs.
MPS)</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was commenced in the City Court of Manila on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It involves two (2) shipments of books and
magazines on board "SS FERNWAVE," consigned to the plaintiff, under

delivered to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provisional claims, filed on <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="1">Jan­uary
 30, 1961</st1:date>, two (2) days after the last discharge, were followed by a
formal claim dated <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The city court having rendered judgment for
the plaintiff, the defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance of
Manila, which sentenced the de­fendants to, jointly and severally, pay to the
plaintiff the invoice value of the missing merchandise, which the Court held to
be P1<span class="GramE">,548.11</span>, with interest thereon at the legal rate
from the date of the filing of the complaint until fully paid, aside from

as indemnity - and shipped on board "SS Pioneer Ming." The
corresponding provisional claim, filed on January 5, 1962, five (5) days after

formal claim for P2<span class="GramE">,015.44</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was filed, on January 2, 1963,

<p class="BODY">The first was for two (2) missing drums of petroleum addi­tives
consigned to the plaintiff, under a bill of lading covering fifteen (15) drums
shipped on board the "SS <span class="SpellE">Turandot</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pro­visional claim, filed on August 22,

shipped on board the "SS Pioneer Minx," from which it was discharged
on September 14, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
subsequently been missing, the corresponding provisional claim, filed on
September 17, 1962, was followed on January 4, 1963, by a formal claim for
P501.42.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth was for four (4) missing bars of pig lead shipped on
board the "SS <span class="SpellE">Samos</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corresponding provisional claim, filed on
September 17, 1962, the very same day of the last discharge of the shipment of
three-hundred seventeen (317) bars, was followed by a formal claim, for
P173.80, on January 4, 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fifth was dismissed by the lower court, from the de­cision of
which plaintiff did not appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sixth was for three (3) missing crates of air compres­sors,
shipped on board the "SS Philippine President <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The corresponding

grease shipped on board the "SS Philippine Jose <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
Santos." The goods having been discharged on December 2, 3 and 4, 1962,
the provisional claim, filed on December 3, 1962, was followed by a formal

<p class="BODY">This case involves the indemnity for five (5) missing cases of
Carter carburetor repair kits consigned to the Philippine Coco­nut Products
Federation, Inc., under Bill of Lading No. 22, and shipped on board the
"SS FERNBANK." The corresponding pro­visional claim, filed on August

followed by a formal claim, for P2<span class="GramE">,085.98</span>, on
September 15, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having insured the con­signee
against all risks and claiming to have been subrogated to its rights by virtue
of a "Loan Receipt" issued by the consignee, the Capital Insurance
and Surety Co. brought this action, on Sep­tember 2, 1961, in the Court of
First Instance of Manila, which sentenced the defendants to, jointly and
severally, indemnify the plaintiff in the sum of P2,085.98 - the stipulated
value of the missing goods - with interest thereon at the rate of six (6) per
cent per annum from said date, until fully paid, and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">These cases hinge on the proper interpretation of paragraph 15 of
the management contract between the defendants herein, as operators of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service in the Port of Manila, on the one hand,
and the Government of the Philippines, thru the Bureau of Customs, on the
other, which paragraph binds the plaintiffs in view of the use made by them or
their predecessors-in-interest of the corresponding delivery receipts bearing,
stamped thereon, as part thereof, the gist of the contents of said paragraph,
which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->In G.R. No. L-24799 there was no express denial
or rejection of the claim filed by the consignee, so that the aforementioned
period commenced to run upon the expiration of one (1) year from <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1959</st1:date>, the date of discharge
of the last package involved in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said period expired on July 27, 1961, or over a month <u>before</u> the
filing of the complaint on September 2, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's action is thus barred by prescription, the same having been
specifically pleaded in defendants' answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the extent of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator's liability for goods damaged or lost in its possession, the
above-quoted paragraph 15 of the management contract provides that said
liability shall be limited to "the invoice value of each package but which
in no case shall be more than five hundred pesos (P500.00) for each package
unless the value is otherwise specified or manifested, and the cor­responding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges had been paid, including all damages that
may be suffered on account of loss, destruction or damage of any merchandise
while in the custody or under the control of the contractor x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." In none of the cases
under consideration have the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges been
paid on the basis of the value of the goods involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither had such value been stated, either in
the ship manifest or in the bill of lading.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the liability of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator in these cases is limited to the invoice value of each package, plus
"all damages that may be suffered on account of loss, destruction or
damage of any merchandise while in the custody or under the control of the
contrac­tor"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
— which liability may in no case exceed P500.00 for each package.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Phil. Education Co., Inc.
v. Manila Port Service<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
a number of cases we have inter­preted this provision in the management
contract as embracing not only the actual amount of costs, insurance and
freight but even marginal fees which had been paid in connection with the
shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freight and insurance charges
were paid in addition to costs of the shipment, and the shortages suffered by
the shipment resulted in their loss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are actual damages suffered on account of the short-delivery, and,
in accordance with par. 15 of the management contract, the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator must answer for them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the defendants are liable for the CIF value of
the goods in question and other legitimate expenses incurred in connection
therewith, all of which, however, shall not exceed P500.00 for each package.</p>

<p class="BODY">With reference now to the propriety of the awards for attor­ney's
fees, We have held in Phil. Education Co., Inc. v. Manila Port Service<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>
that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (a)<span class="SpellE">ppellant</span> (Manila Port Service) has been systematically
rejecting claims of the kind shown at bar, as attested by numerous decisions of
this Court in this and past years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
conduct renders the award of attorneys' fees just and equitable and the
objection (thereto) must be rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Civil Code, Art. 2208, No. 11)." Defendants have not advanced any
reason, and <span class="GramE">We</span> find none, to warrant departure from
this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the con­trary, the appeals
of similar nature that have kept on coming de­spite said view demand a more
emphatic reiteration thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G.R. No.</span> L-24799, defendants assail
the plaintiff's right to prose­cute the case upon the ground that it is not the
real party in inter­est, despite a "loan receipt" whereby the
consignee appointed "the agent and/or officers of said (plaintiff)
insurance company and their successors severally my/our agents and attorneys in
fact with irrevocable power of attorney to collect any claim, and to begin,
prosecute, compromise or withdraw in my or our name x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> and to execute in my or our name any documents
which may be necessary to carry into effect the purpose of this agree­ment."
We find no merit in defendants' pretense, it being undis­puted that plaintiff
is the insurer of the goods involved in the case and that, as such, it stands
to lose the value of the insur­ance policy issued <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
should the claim involved in the complaint be disallowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The irrevocable nature of said power of
attorney, coupled with the insurance contract in favor of the consignee, has
vested in the plaintiff an actual and special inter­est different from that of
an ordinary attorney-in-fact.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G.R. No.</span> L-24622, defendants allege
that they cannot be held liable under the sixth and seventh causes of action
therein set up, the contract in favor of the Manila Port Service as <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator having expired on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is clearly untenable insofar as
the goods involved in the sixth cause of action are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said goods were delivered to the MPS on
November 11, 1962, and the provisional claim for short-delivery was filed on
November 13, 1962, prior to the expiration of the management contract in favor
of the MPS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the shortage
took place while the goods were in its custody.</p>

<p class="BODY">The seventh cause of action refers to goods discharged from the
carrying vessel on December 2, .3 and 4, 1962, or after the expiration of the
aforementioned management contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears, however, that on January 23, 1963, the MPS issued a certificate to the
effect that "out of the manifested 510 packages" consigned to the
plaintiff under Bill of Lading No. 66, "only 508 packages appear in <u>our</u>
records to have been delivered as of this date." What is more, on
September 23, 1963, the MPS acknow­ledged receipt of plaintiff's claim for the
shortage, with a state­ment that said claim "is under careful
consideration and we shall let you know of our action thereon in due
time." These acts necessarily imply that the 510 packages were discharged
from the carrying vessel unto the custody <u>of the MPS</u>, which in turn
delivered only 508 packages to the consignees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidently, it took some time before the MPS could actually turn over the
<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service to the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants are accordingly liable for the
missing packages.</p>
