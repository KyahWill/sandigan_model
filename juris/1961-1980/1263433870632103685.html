				<H3>MANUEL J.C. REYES, PETITIONER, VS. HON. LEONOR
INES-LUCIANO, AS JUDGE OF THE JUVENILE AND DOMESTIC RELATIONS COURT, QUEZON CITY, COURT OF APPEALS AND CELIA ILUSTRE-REYES, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a motion for reconsideration filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1979</st1:date> by the private
respondent, Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes, asking that the
decision be modified by making the payment of the support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> of Four Thousand Pesos (P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) a month retroact to June 1976, on the following
grounds:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is ample evidence that the businesses of
the petitioner, Manuel J. C. Reyes, can very easily bear the burden of support;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> is directed mainly on the private
respondent's share in the conjugal partnership;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Full support may be taken from the private
respondent's share of the conjugal properties;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent, Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes, has incurred obligations during the three
(3) year period that she was not given any actual support and she also has to
pay attorney's fees;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corporation, Development and Technology
Consultants, Inc., of which the petitioner is the controlling stockholder, in
addition to four (4) cars in its name, has acquired two (2) new <span class="SpellE">Opel</span> Record sedan cars, each worth One Hundred Twenty
Thousand Pesos (P120<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), and the petitioner lives
in an expensive condominium and maintains business offices in different
buildings in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> and Manila; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1979</st1:date>, the petitioner and his three (3) children
went abroad on a two-month pleasure trip, while the private respondent, Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes, lives in a difficult and penurious
situation, deeply in debt and caught in the web of high prices and current
inflation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has also filed a motion for reconsideration of the
decision on the grounds that (1) the trial court should be ordered to receive
evidence on the issue of whether or not the private respondent is entitled to
support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>;
and (2) assuming, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that the private
respondent is entitled to support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, the amount of Four Thousand Pesos (P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) is not only excessive for the needs of private
respondent but beyond the means of the petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court has gone over
the different exhibits attached by the parties to their respective
motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Development and Technology
Consultants, Inc. has multi-million construction projects with gross receipts
of several million pesos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cannot seriously complain that the amount of
support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>
he is ordered to pay will ruin him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
has not denied the allegations of the private respondent that the Development
and Technology Consultants, Inc. has acquired two (2) new automobiles and that
the petitioner maintains expensive offices and resides in an expensive
condominium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not also denied that
he and his three (3) children had recently traveled abroad for two (2) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">The support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> in the amount of Four Thousand Pesos (P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) is reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the motion for reconsideration of the petitioner has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving the motion for reconsideration of the private
respondent, Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes, the Court has taken
into consideration the fact that in view of the issuance of the restraining
order by the Court of Appeals she had not received any support at all until
this Court issued a resolution allowing her only One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00)
a month.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Obviously, during the
period that she was not </span>receiving any support she incurred debts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must also pay attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that whatever support the private respondent, Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes, might now be receiving will be deducted from
her share of the conjugal properties, the Court finds that under the equities
and circumstances of the case, the decision should be modified so as to make
the support <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendente</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>
of Four Thousand Pesos (P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) a month retroact to
November 1, 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1979</st1:date> is hereby modified
in the sense that the support <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendente</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> at the rate of Four Thousand Pesos (P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) a month should commence from <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1977</st1:date>.</p>
