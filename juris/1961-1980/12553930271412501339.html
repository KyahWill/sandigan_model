				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by certiorari taken by Valleson, Inc. from a decision of 
the Court of Industrial Relations.<p></p>
<p>The facts are set forth in said decision, from which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * petitioner was employed as cashier by respondent company from 
September 1, 1955 up to November 23, 1957. She worked from 9:00 o'clock a.m. to 
1:00 o'clock p.m. and from 4:00 o'clock p.m. to 7:00 o'clock p.m., or a total of 
seven (7) hours daily, for which she was paid P3.50 a day. During her 
employment, petitioner got married but inspite her marriage, she did not change 
her usual signature in the payroll. There is an unwritten policy in respondent 
company that all female employees should be single during their employment. 
Sometime in October, 1956, petitioner personally asked the general manager of 
respondent company, Mr. Rqstituto M. Sibal, (not in writing) for maternity leave 
with pay but the latter refused to grant the same. On January 12, 1957, 
petitioner delivered her first child. Sometime in October, 1957, petitioner 
personally asked again Mr. Sibal for maternity leave with pay because she was 
then pregnant on her second child but she was again refused such benefit. 
Sometime in November, 1957, Ruben Mallari, the accountant of respondent company, 
found a shortage of P50.00 when he checked up the cashier's report of the 
petitioner. Mallari reported the matter to Mr. Sibal and the latter immediately 
conducted an investigation. It was found out that the petitioner and one Lecita 
Abary, also a cashier in the respondent company, were, from time to time, taking 
from their cash registers certain amounts of money and lending them to different 
employees which practice was not only without the knowledge of the management 
but also contrary to the rules and regulations of said store. This finding was 
admitted by said cashiers in a written statement dated November 18, 1957. On 
November 23, 1957, upon recommendation of the legal department of respondent 
company, the two cashiers were temporarily suspended which was later made 
permanent dismissal. On January 2, 1958, petitioner gave birth to her second 
child."</p></blockquote>
<p>On April 6, 1960, Bessie C. Tiburcio filed, with the Court of Industrial 
Relations, a petition which was amended on May 3, 1960, praying for differential 
pay, maternity leave pay and reinstatement, in addition to attorney's fees. 
After appropriate proceedings, a decision was rendered by Hon. Amando C. 
Bugayong, Associate Judge of said court, the dispositive part of which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition for the payment of wage 
differential under the Minimum Wage Law at the rate of Fifty Centavos (P0.50) 
per day of work in which petitioner was paid only P3.50 a day during the period 
from September 1, 1955 up to November 23, 1957 and the petition for maternity 
leave with pay for the delivery of petitioner's two children on January 12, 1957 
and January 2, 1958 are hereby granted, while the petition for reinstatement 
with back wages is hereby dismissed.</p>
<p>"In order to have an accurate computation of the wage differentials and 
maternity leave with pay, the Field Corporation Auditor of this Court or any of 
his assistants is hereby directed to proceed to the premises of respondent 
company at 558 Carriedo, Manila and examine its payrolls, daily time records and 
other pertinent papers for purposes of computing petitioner's wage differentials 
and maternity pay in accordance with this decision, and submit a report thereof 
for further disposition by this Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>The company moved for a reconsideration of said decision, but the motion was 
denied by unanimous resolution of said Court sitting <em>en banc</em>. Hence, 
this appeal by writ of certiorari.</p>
<p>Petitioner Valleson, Inc. assails the decision appealed from upon several 
grounds, only one of which need be considered in view of the conclusion we have 
reached in connection therewith. We refer to the jurisdiction of the Court of 
Industrial Relations to hear and decide this case. Petitioner maintained in said 
Court, and still maintains, that the same had no such jurisdiction, for the 
following reasons:</p>
<ol><li>The Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875) merely allows the Court of 
Industrial Relations to retain its jurisdiction to hear the cases, involving the 
application of Republic Act No. 602 (the Minimum Wage Law), referred to in 
paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of section 16 of said Act, which are 
limited, respectively, to cases in which there is "a dispute as to minimum wages 
<i>above</i> the applicable statutory minimum" and cases "where the demands of 
minimum wages involve an <i>actual strike</i>", and the present case does not 
come under either of these two (2) categories; and<br><br>
</li><li>The right to maternity leave is not one of those which the Court of 
Industrial Relations may hear and decide under Republic Act No. 875. 
</li></ol>We find that petitioner's pretense is well taken. At the outset, it is 
not denied that claims for maternity leave are per se beyond the jurisdiction of 
the Court of Industrial Relations. The latter's assertion for authority to pass 
upon the maternity leave pay sought to be recovered by Bessie C. Tiburcio is 
predicated upon the theory that her cause of action therefor is, or may be 
considered, incidental to her claim for differential pay under the Minimum Wage 
Law. 
<p>As regards this claim for differential pay, section 7 of Republic Act No. 875 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In order to prevent undue restriction of free enterprise for capital and 
labor and to encourage the truly democratic method of regulating the relations 
between the employer and employee by means of an agreement freely entered into 
in collective bargaining, no court of the Philippines shall have the power to 
set wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of employment except 
as in this Act is otherwise provided and except as is provided in Republic Act 
Numbered Six hundred two and Commonwealth Act Numbered Four hundred forty-four 
as to hours of work."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the other hand, section 16 of Republic Act No. 602 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) The Court of First Instance shall have jurisdiction to restrain 
violations of this Act; action by the Secretary or by the employees affected to 
recover underpayment may be brought in any competent court, which shall render 
its decision on such cases within fifteen days from the time the case has been 
submitted for decision; in appropriate instances, appeal from the decision of 
these courts on any action under this Act shall be in accordance with applicable 
laws.</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) In the event that a dispute case before the Court of Industrial 
Relations involves as the sole issue or as one of the issues a dispute as to 
minimum wages above the applicable statutory minimum, and the Secretary of Labor 
has issued no wage order for the industry or locality applicable to the 
enterprise, the Court of Industrial Relations may hear and decide such wage 
issue: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary of Labor shall not 
undertake to fix the minimum wage for an industry or branch thereof which 
involves only a single enterprise or a single employer.</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) Where the demands of minimum wages involves an actual strike, the 
matter shall be submitted to the Secretary of Labor, who shall attempt to secure 
a settlement between the parties through conciliation. Should the Secretary fail 
within fifteen days to effect said settlement, he shall endorse the matter 
together with other issues involved, to the Court of Industrial Relations which 
will acquire jurisdiction on the case including the minimum wage issue, and 
after a hearing where the views of the Secretary of Labor will be given, will 
decide the case in the same manner as provided in other cases. The decision 
shall be rendered by the court <i>en banc</i> within fifteen days after the case 
has been submitted for the determination, and its finding of facts shall be 
conclusive if supported by substantial evidence and shall be subject only to an 
appeal by certiorari."</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears from this section 16 that, for the Court of Industrial Relations 
to have jurisdiction over a minimum wage case, it is necessary, either that the 
wage therein claimed be "<em>above</em> the applicable statutory minimum", or, 
else, that the demand of minimum wage therein made "involve an actual strike". 
No such actual strike is involved in the present case. Furthermore, the 
differential pay claimed by Bessie C. Tiburcio is based only upon the statutory 
minimum of P4.00 a day. In fact, it is not disputed that the case at bar does 
not fall under subdivisions (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of said section 16. It is 
thus apparent that the Court of Industrial Relations had no jurisdiction to hear 
and decide this case, insofar as the issue of differential pay is concerned, 
and, consequently, as regards, the maternity leave pay.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, and this case is hereby 
dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs. It is so ordered.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., 
Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
