				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 22 February 1957 in the Court of First Instance of Manila the Solicitor 
General, in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, brought an action against 
J. Amado Araneta and J. Amado Araneta &amp; Company, Inc., as principals, and 
the Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Company, Inc., as surety, to recover from them 
jointly and severally the sum of P30, as fixed tax upon business due from 1946 
to 1948, imposed by section 182, in connection with sections 178 to 180 of the 
National Internal Revenue Code, as amended; P5,067.42, as 2% tax on P253,370.84, 
the gross receipts from their business as a common carrier during the said 
period, pursuant to section 192 of the same Code; and P1,266.86, as 25% 
surcharge, or a total sum of P6,364.28, the payment of which was guaranteed by a 
bond (Annex B) executed by the defendant-surety, and 6% interest on the amount 
of P6,364.28 from 6 December 1951, when the first extrajudicial demand was made, 
until fully paid. On 12 March 1957 the defendants-principals filed a motion to 
dismiss the plaintiff's complaint on the ground that its cause of action is 
barred by the statute of limitations and on 20 March 1957 the plaintiff, an 
objection thereto. On 23 March 1957 the Court denied the defendants-principals' 
motion to dismiss.
<p>On 29 March 1957 the defendants-principals filed their answer denying that 
they had operated their vessel as a common carrier, the truth being that they 
had used it to ship, goods and cargoes manufactured and sold by them and allied 
companies owned and/or controlled by them; asserting that granting without 
admitting that they were liable for common carrier's tax, their gross receipts 
during the alleged period was P166,299.67 only and not P253,370.24; and that the 
"Bond to Guarantee Payment of Common Carrier's Tax and Compensating Tax," 
attached to the complaint as Annex A or to the stipulation of facts filed on 25 
February 1958 as Annex B, is not genuine and had not been duly executed because 
the same had not been approved by the Collector of Internal Revenue; and setting 
up affirmative defenses that the five-year period of limitation provided for in 
section 332, paragraph (<i>c</i>), of the National Internal Revenue Code, as 
amended, already had elapsed, hence the plaintiff's action was barred; and that 
granting that the said bond was valid, the enforcement of the principal 
obligation having been barred, it follows that the enforcement of the obligation 
undertaken in the said bond was also barred. They set up a counterclaim of 
P2,000 for expenses of litigation and attorney's fees incurred in defending 
their legal rights. On 30 March 1957 the defendant-surety filed its answer 
setting up the following affirmative defenses; that the plaintiff's complaint 
states no cause of action; that its liability under the bond (Annex B) was 
extinguished by its novation and alteration without its knowledge and consent; 
that granting that its liability still subsists, the said bond being merely 
secondary or auxiliary to a principal obligation that could no longer be 
enforced by reason of prescription, its obligation thereunder could, likewise, 
no longer be enforced; and that the bond (Annex B), not having been approved by 
the Collector of Internal Revenue, was void. As counterclaim, it sought from the 
plaintiff the sum of P2,500 for expenses of litigation and attorney's fees 
incurred for the protection of its rights.</p>
<p>On 10 April 1957 the plaintiff answered the defendants' respective 
counterclaims, alleging that it has a valid cause of action against them and 
that its complaint was filed pursuant to its policy of collecting long overdue 
accounts from delinquent taxpayers.</p>
<p>After obtaining leave of court, on 25 May 1957 the defendant-surety filed an 
amended answer reiterating its denials, affirmative defenses and counterclaim in 
its first answer and adding or including a cross-claim against the 
defendants-principals for recovery from the latter of whatever sum of money it 
might be ordered to.pay the plaintiff by judgment of the Court, with interest at 
the rate of 12% per annum from the date of payment until the sum it shall have 
paid be fully reimbursed to it by the defendants-principals; of the sum of 
P3,598.20 as premiums due for the period from 18 September 1949 to 18 March 
1957, with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from 16 March 1957 until fully 
paid; of a sum equivalent to 15% of the total amount claimed as attorney's fees, 
as agreed upon in the indemnity bond executed by the cross-defendants on 21 
March 1949 and accepted by the cross-plaintiff (Annex "1-MSFCI") attached to the 
amended answer and made a part thereof; and of the costs of the suit with 
respect to its cross-claim. It prayed further for any other just and equitable 
relief.</p>
<p>On 10 June 1957 the cross-defendants filed an answer to the cross-complaint 
of the defendant-surety, denying the truth, genuineness and correctness of the 
copy of the bond attached to the complaint as Annex A and as Annex B of the 
stipulation of facts; and claiming that the mere filing of a suit against the 
cross-plaintiff did not render it liable to pay the alleged tax liability of the 
cross-defendants; that the bond file on 18 March 1949 by the cross-plaintiff 
(Annex B) was null and void, hence the same could not be the basis of the 
cross-plaintiff's cross-claim against the cross-defendants; that since both of 
them have denied liability to the plaintiff for any amount, the cross-plaintiff 
has no cause of action against the cross-defendants; and that the amount of 
expenses of litigation and attorney's fees claimed by the cross-plaintiff, 
should there be any, is to be determined by the Court in the exercise of its 
discretion. As counterclaim, they prayed for recovery from the cross-plaintiff 
of the sum of P2,000 as expenses of litigation and attorney's fees incurred in 
defending their rights on the cross-claim.</p>
<p>On 18 June 1957 the cross-plaintiff filed an answer to the cross-defendants' 
counterclaim denying the allegations therein and setting up a counterclaim to 
the cross-defendants' counterclaim in the amount of P1,000 as exemplary 
damages.</p>
<p>On 3 December 1957 the defendants-principals filed a motion to dismiss on the 
ground of lack of jurisdiction because the case involves a disputed tax 
assessment; on 9 December 1957 the plaintiff, an "opposition" thereto. On 12 
December 1957 the Court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>On 25 February 1957 the cross-plaintiff and the cross-defendants entered into 
the following stipulation of facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COME NOW, the parties in the cross-complaint represented by their respective 
counsel and to this Honorable Court respectfully submit the following 
stipulation of facts:</p>
<ol><li>That the jurisdictional facts and the capacity of the parties to sue and be 
sued are admitted; 

<p></p></li><li>That on or about March 18, 1949, cross-defendant J. Amado Araneta and J. 
Amado Araneta &amp; Co., Inc. (Philippine Shipping Lines) represented by J. 
Amado Araneta requested the herein cross-plaintiff to post a surety bond in 
behalf of cross-defendant Philippine Shipping Lines and in favor of the Republic 
of the Philippines in the amount of P11,814.00 to guarantee the payment of the 
Common Carrier's Tax and Compensating Tax of the former with the latter, to 
which request the cross-plaintiff agreed and did in fact post the said bond, the 
original copy of which is attached as Annex "A" of the Stipulation of Facts 
entered into with the plaintiff Republic of the Philippines and made an integral 
part hereof by reference as Annex "1-MSFC";<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That the parties admit the truth of the terms and conditions of said bond;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That the cross-plaintiff agreed and did in fact post the aforesaid surety 
bond upon written undertaking of the cross-defendants the original carbon copy 
of which is hereto attached as Annex "2-MSFCI" and made an integral part of this 
stipulation of facts obligating themselves to indemnify the cross-plaintiff for 
any damage, losses, costs, charges or expenses of whatever kind and nature 
including counsel or attorney's fees which the company may incur at any time as 
a consequence of having become surety of the above-mentioned bond;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That the parties admit the truth of the terms and conditions of the said 
written undertakings marked Annex "2-MSFCI";<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That upon the passage and approval of Republic Act No. 361 on June 9, 1949, 
exempting from payment of the compensating tax the purchase or receipt of 
vessels, their equipment and/or appurtenances, from without the Philippines, 
before or after the taking effect of said Republic Act No. 361, the alleged tax 
liability of the cross-defendant was reduced by P5,250.00 from the original 
assessment of P11,814.00 leaving the sum of P6,364.28 only, representing the 
fixed and common carrier's tax allegedly due the Government;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That on February 22, 1957, the Republic of the Philippines initiated court 
proceedings seeking to recover from the cross-defendants as principal and the 
cross-plaintiff as surety the said sum of P6,364.28 including penalties plus six 
(6%) percent thereon from December 6, 1951 until fully paid plus costs;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That in accordance with the indemnity agreement Annex "2-MSFCI", the 
cross-defendants agreed to indemnify the cross-plaintiff as soon as the latter 
has become liable for the payment of any amount under the aforementioned bond, 
whether or not it shall have paid such sum or sums of money, or any part 
thereof;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That in spite of repeated demands cross-defendants have failed and refused 
and still fail and refuse to indemnify the cross-plaintiff the amount claimed 
for in the cross-plaintiff's complaint;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That the cross-plaintiff hereby withdraws the second and third causes of 
action as contained in the cross-claim; and<p></p> </li><li>That the parties hereto hereby withdraw their respective counterclaims. 
</li></ol></blockquote>
<p>which they submitted to the Court (pp. 71-76; 84-91, recs. on app.).</p> <p>On the same day, 25 February 1957, all the parties to this case submitted to 
the Court the following stipulation of facts dated 7 February 1957:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COME NOW the parties in the above-entitled case represented by their 
respective counsel and to this Honorable Court respectfully submit the following 
stipulation of facts:</p>
<ol><li>That the jurisdictional facts and the capacity of the parties to sue and be 
sued are admitted; 

<p></p></li><li>That sometime in 1946, the defendant J. Amado Araneta purchased from the 
Philippine Shipping Commission, and received delivery of one F. S. vessel for 
the sum of P120,000.00;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That during the fourth quarter of 1946 up to and including the fourth 
quarter of 194&amp;, defendants J. Amado Araneta and/or J, Amado Araneta &amp; 
Co., operated said F. S. vessel within Philippine waters under the business 
style "Philippine Shipping Lines" without first providing themselves with the 
necessary fixed tax C-3-C required by Sec. 182 of the Tax Code;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That during the above-mentioned period from the fourth quarter of 1946 to 
the fourth quarter of 1947, said defendants J. Amado Araneta and/or J. Amado 
Araneta &amp; Co., failed to make a return of gross receipts from the operation 
of said F. S. Vessel;<p></p> </li><li>That the Bureau of Internal Revenue conducted an examination of the books of 
the Philippine Shipping Lines, as a result of which the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue assessed defendant in the sums of P6,361.28, as fixed and percentage 
taxes and surcharge and P5,250.00 as compensating tax and surcharge, or a total 
of P11,614.28, as evidenced by the letter, dated May 15, 1943, hereto attached

<p></p></li><li>That in view of the enactment of Rep. Act No. 361, the defendant J. Amado 
Araneta and/or J. Amado Araneta &amp; Co., Inc. sent a letter to the Collector 
of Internal Revenue dated June 14, 1949, a certified true copy of which is 
hereto attached with this stipulation of facts as Annex "C" and made an integral 
part hereof. Said letter was answered by the Collector of Internal Revenue dated 
June 21, 1949, a certified true copy of which is likewise attached to this 
stipulation of facts as Annex "D" and made an integral part hereof;<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That plaintiff through the Collector of Internal Revenue sent letters of 
demand to the defendants J. Amado Araneta and the Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity 
Co., Inc., dated December 6, 1951 and May 17, 1952, respectively, certified true 
copies of which are hereto attached to this stipulation of facts as Annexes "E" 
and "F" and made integral parts hereof. Another set of demand letters dated 
November 14, 1953, was sent to the defendant J. Amado Araneta under the firm

Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc., jointly and severally the amount of P6,364.28 
including penalties plus 6% interest thereon from December 6, 1951, until fully 
paid, and/or in default thereof, to execute upon the bond (Annex "B") for the 
satisfaction of the claim.</li></ol><p></p> Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that 
the above case be submitted for decision based upon the above stipulation of 
facts. (pp. 76-101; 66-83, recs. on app.). </blockquote>
<p>On 31 May 1958 the Court rendered judgment holding that the action brought by 
the plaintiff was for the enforcement of an obligation undertaken by the 
defendants-principals and the defendant-surety in the bond executed by them in 
favor of the plaintiff (Annex B); that the action having been brought on 22 
February 1957 was within the period of ten years from 18 March 1949, the date of 
execution of the bond; that the defendants-principals having defaulted in the 
payment of their tax obligation, which the defendant-surety had guaranteed to 
pay should the principals fail, the surety's obligation undertaken in the bond 
became a principal obligation; and that although the Collector of Internal 
Revenue failed to affix his signature in the bond (Annex B), the latter's 
acceptance constituted approval thereof, and ordering the defendants, jointly 
and severally, to pay the plaintiff the sum of P6,364.28, with interest at the 
rate of 6% per annum from 22 February 1957, the date of the filing of the 
complaint, until fully paid; and dismissing the defendants' counterclaim against 
the plaintiff and those against each other as well as the cross-claim by the 
cross-plaintiff and defendant-surety against the cross-defendants and 
defendants-principals, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p>On 12 June and 5 July 1958 the defendants filed motions for reconsideration; 
on 14 June 1958, the cross-defendants, an objection to the cross-plaintiff's 
motion for reconsideration.</p>
<p>On 27 June and 8 July 1958 the Court denied the defendants' respective 
motions for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The defendants have appealed separately.</p>
<p>The contention of the appellants-taxpayers (J. Amado Araneta and J. Amado 
Araneta &amp; Company, Inc.) is that the appellee's cause of action has 
prescribed, because the action for recovery of internal revenue taxes and 
surcharge due brought on 22 February 1957, was not commenced within the period 
of five years after the assessment dated 15 May 1948 had been made (Annex A); 
that the bond executed by them and the appellant-surety (Manila Surety &amp; 
Fidelity Company, Inc.) to guarantee payment of the common carrier's tax (Annex 
B), being merely auxiliary or ancillary to the principal obligation the 
enforcement of which has prescribed, the enforcement of their auxiliary 
obligation in the bond also has prescribed; and that the bond (Annex B) is null 
and void because the same was not approved by the Collector of Internal 
Revenue.</p>
<p>The ground of the appellant-surety's appeal is that, notwithstanding the fact 
that the appellants-taxpayers had bound themselves to indemnify it "for any 
damage, loss, costs, charges, or expenses of whatever kind and nature," as a 
result of its having executed and filed the bond marked as Annex B (Annex 
2-MSFCI), the trial court dismissed its cross-claim against the 
appellants-taxpayers instead of ordering them to pay it whatever amount it shall 
have paid to the appellee by virtue of its judgment and the stipulated interests 
thereon from the date of payment of said amount by the cross-plaintiff to the 
appellee until full payment thereof by the cross-defendants to the 
cross-plaintiff.</p>
<p>The appellants-taxpayers' appeal is without merit. They cannot invoke 
prescription under the provisions of section 331 of the National Internal 
Revenue Code, as amended, because the appellee is suing on the bond executed and 
filed by them and the appellant-surety (Annex B). It must be borne in mind that 
on 15 March 1948 the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed the 
appellants-taxpayers for fixed tax upon business due from 1946 to 1948 under the 
provisions of section 182, in connection with sections 172 to 180, of the 
National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and 2% tax on gross receipts from 
their business as common carrier under those of section 192 of the same Code, 
and surcharge, all amounting to P6,364.28 (Annex A)<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>; that the appellants-taxpayers requested the 
Collector of Internal Revenue to be allowed to pay their tax liability in six 
equal monthly installments beginning 15 April 1949; that the Collector of 
Internal Revenue granted their request provided a bond to guarantee payment of 
their tax liability be filed by them (Annex B); that the appellants-taxpayers 
requested the appellant-surety to underwrite the required bond (Annex 2-MSFCI); 
and that on 18 March 1949 the appellants-taxpayers and the appellant-surety 
executed the required bond (Annex B) and submitted it to the Collector of 
Internal Revenue who received and kept it. The condition of the bond is—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * that if the above-bounden Principal (the appellants-taxpayers) truly 
and faithfully make a prompt and complete payment of the 2% common carrier's tax 
and compensating tax due on the above-mentioned vessel for the year 1948, in six 
(6) equal monthly installment commencing on April 15, 1949, as well as all fines 
and penalties imposed m accordance with the National Internal Revenue Code, then 
this obligation shall be null and void, otherwise it shall remain in full force 
and effect. (Annex B).</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellants-taxpayers failed to pay any of the installments .due despite 
demand (Annexes E, G &amp; I). Hence, the appellee sued on the bond (Annex B) 
which is a separate and distinct obligation of the parties thereto. For this 
Court to sustain the appellants' defense of prescription would in effect nullify 
their undertaking in the bond which was executed and filed by them to lighten 
their tax obligation or burden by being allowed to pay in six equal monthly 
installments.</p>
<p>The action to enforce the obligation on the bond executed on 18 March 1949, 
having been filed in court by the appellee on 22 February 1957, was within the 
prescriptive period of ten years.</p>
<p>The appellants-taxpayers argument that the bond (Annex B) being ancillary to 
the principal obligation to pay their tax liability, which already has 
prescribed, the enforcement of their obligation in the bond also has prescribed, 
is untenable. What has been said about their claim of prescription against the 
collection of the tax equally applies to the claim of prescription against the 
enforcement of the bond obligation or undertaking.</p>
<p>The act of the Collector of Internal Revenue in receiving and keeping the 
bond, deferring collection of the tax, and suing on the bond (Annex B) upon 
failure of the appellants-taxpayers to pay the tax, the payment of which is 
guaranteed by the bond, meant or amounted to approval thereof.</p>
<p>Turning now to the appeal of the appellant-surety, the appellants-taxpayers 
having bound themselves to the former, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INDEMNITY: (b) To indemnify the Company for any damage, loss, costs, charges, 
or expenses of whatever kind and nature, including counsel or attorney's fees, 
which the Company may, at any time, sustain or incur, as a consequence of having 
become surety upon the abovementioned bond; said attorney's fees shall not be 
less than fifteen (15%) per cent of the total amount claimed in any action which 
the Company may institute against the undersigned in Court.</p>
<p>MATURITY OF THE OBLIGATION UNDER THIS BOND: (<i>c</i>) <i>Said indemnity 
shall be paid to the COMPANY as soon as it has become liable for the payment of 
any amount, under the abovementioned bond, whether or not it shall have paid 
such sum or sums of money, or any part thereof</i>.</p>
<p>INTEREST IN CASE OF DEFAULT: (d) And in the case of non-payment of the said 
sum.or sums of money to the Company by the undersigned, the said undersigned 
shall pay, upon said sum or sums of money, an interest of twelve (12%) per cent 
per annum, which interest, while not paid, shall be liquidated and accumulated 
monthly to the capital owned by the undersigned, drawing the same interest as 
the said capital.</p>
<p>UNQUESTIONABILITY OF THE PAYMENT AND DISBURSEMENT MADE BY THE COMPANY: (e) 
Any payment or disbursement made by the COMPANY on account of the abovementioned 
bond, either in the belief that it was bound to make said payment or 
disbursement, or in the belief that the payment or disbursement made was 
necessary or expedient, in order to avoid greater losses or obligations for 
which it would be liable under the abovementioned bond, shall be final and shall 
not be questioned by the undersigned who hereby agree to indemnify, jointly and 
severally to the Company, for each and everyone of said payments and 
disbursements. (Italics supplied.) Annex "2-MSFCI"</p></blockquote>
<p>should be ordered to reimburse the appellant-surety for whatever amount it 
shall have paid to the appellee by virtue of the judgment rendered in this case 
and to pay the stipulated interest thereon. The premium and attorney's fees 
sought to be collected by the appellant-surety in the second and third causes of 
action of its cross-complaint against the appellants-taxpayers have been
