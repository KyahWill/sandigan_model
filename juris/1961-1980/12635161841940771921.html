				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction, to
annul an order for the execution of the decision of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carigara</span>, in
Civil Case No. 433 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
filing of said petition we authorized the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction prayed for, upon the filing and approval of the requisite bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> and Lucia, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Alcober</span>
- hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span> - were
defendants in said civil case, which was instituted by respondents <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gardon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Gler</span> - hereinafter
referred to as the plaintiffs - to establish their title to a parcel of land
described in the com­plaint, as alleged owners of said land, and to annul the
title thereto issued in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span>, with
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents, <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Herculano</span> <span class="SpellE">Basea</span> - hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Baseas</span>
- were <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> in said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1965</st1:date>,
respondent Judge, <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> <span class="SpellE">Garciano</span>,
who presided over said court, rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and
the <span class="SpellE">Baseas</span> and against the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter filed, on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1965</st1:date>, their notice of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their appeal bond and record on appeal were
approved by respondent Judge on April 3, 1965, Four days later, or on April 7,
1965, the plaintiffs filed a motion for the execution of said decision pending
appeal, which motion was granted by respondent Judge, in an order dated April
20, 1965, directing the issuance of the writ prayed for, upon the posting of a
bond of P500,00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1965</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Baseas</span>, likewise, moved for the execution of the same
judgment, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal, at the
same time stating that they adopted as theirs plaintiffs' motion of <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1965</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span> moved for a reconsideration of said
order of <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1965</st1:date>,
and filed, on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1965</st1:date>, a
motion for the approval of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond in the
sum of P1,000.00 posted by them and the stay of said execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1965</st1:date>, respondent Judge denied said motion for
reconsideration, as well as the motion to stay execution, and granted the
motion of the <span class="SpellE">Baseas</span> dated <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span> moved to set aside the
order of <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1965</st1:date>,
which respondent Judge denied on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="5">May
 29, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1965</st1:date>, the clerk of court had
issued the corresponding writ of execution, whereupon the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span>
commenced the present action.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case hinges on the question whether or not respondent Judge
had jurisdiction to issue its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="4">April
 20, 1965</st1:date>, directing the execution of the decision rendered in the
main case, considering that plaintiffs' motion for execution had been filed
after the perfection of the appeal from said decision taken by the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge resolved the issue in the affirmative, upon the
authority of <span class="SpellE">Laurilla</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Uichangco</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and, also, upon the ground that "the plaintiffs on the day the record on
appeal was submitted for approval, manifested to the Court (their intention) to
file a motion for execution pending appeal, which was actually filed on April
7, 1965 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Laurilla</span> case is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for execution of the judgment
therein was <u>actually filed before the perfection of the appeal</u> therein
taken, although it was <u>not granted until after the approval of the record on
appeal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, accordingly
declared that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
approval given to the record on appeal filed by the petitioner in the court
below was <u>merely provisional</u>; and that both the court and the parties
understood that <u>such approval was not final</u>, since there was another
question still pending, to wit, whether a writ of execution should be issued
pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be presumed
that the court and the parties knew that if the court granted the writ of
execution, <u>its order had to be included in the records to be elevated to the
appellate court</u> (Rule 39, sec. 2) and hence, <u>the record of appeal</u>, <u>as
it stood before the court acted on the motion for execution</u>, <u>could not
be considered complete and definitive</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is plain that if the approval of the record was final and not merely
provisional, there was no sense in giving the parties time to submit memoranda
on the merits of the motion for execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the appellant, now petitioner, did not call attention at
the time to the futility of submitting a memorandum, since upon approval of the
record of appeal the court would no longer have jurisdiction to issue
execution, confirms our view that the approval of the record was understood by
all concerned to be <u>provisional</u> in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That being the case</u>, the court
retained jurisdiction to resolve the motion for execution and to order it
issued unless the appellant filed the corresponding <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent issuance of the
writs of execution were <u>mere implementations of the power thus reserved</u>
and consequently, it can not be said that the court acted without or in excess
of its jurisdiction in issuing the same." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Section 9 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court
provides that "upon the approval of the record on appeal and of the appeal
bond" - "if the notice of appeal, the appeal bond and the record on
appeal have been filed in due time," – the "<u>trial court loses its
jurisdiction over the case</u>, except":<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) to "issue orders for the <u>protection and preservation</u> of
the rights of the parties <u>which do not involve any matter litigated by the
appeal</u>;" (2) to "approve compromises offered by the parties prior
to the trans­mittal of the record on appeal to the appellate court," and
(3) to "permit the prosecution of a pauper's appeal."</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for execution filed by the plaintiffs in the lower
court does not come under any of these ex­ceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the writ of execution issued in pursuance
of the order of respondent Judge of April 20, 1965, directed that the
plaintiffs be placed in possession of one-third (1/3) of the litigated
property; that one-half (1/2) thereof be placed in the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Baseas</span>; that the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span> be made
to execute the corresponding deeds of conveyance of said portions in favor of
the plaintiffs and the <span class="SpellE">Baseas</span>, as well as to pay the
costs and attorney's fees in the sum of P500.00, in addition to the expenses
incidental to the execution of the decision appealed from - the propriety of
which is the very issue litigated in the appeal taken by the <span class="SpellE">Alcobers</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Zurbano</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
we used the following language:</p>

<blockquote>"The sole question now before this Court is whether or not the
trial court may issue partial execution of its judgment after appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> had been perfected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By statute, once the appeal is perfected, 'the trial court
loses its jurisdiction over the case, except to issue orders for the protection
and preservation of the rights of the parties which do not involve any matter
litigated by the appeal' (Sec. 9, Rule 41, Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Execution of a judgment is a proceeding
affecting the rights of the parties</u>, <u>involving the matter litigated by
the appeal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Its purpose is not to
preserve and protect the subject of the litigation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The lower court accordingly has lost its
power<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to issue a writ of partial
execution of the <span class="SpellE">judgement</span> herein</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Marcelo vs. <span class="SpellE">Estacio</span>,
69 Phil., 145, 148, 149, citing <span class="SpellE">Syquia</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, et al., 60 Phil. 186, 190-191; <span class="SpellE">Abrasaldo</span> vs. Fernandez, et al., 97 Phil., 964-965)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This view was, in effect, reiterated in our decision in <span class="SpellE">Cabilao</span> vs. Hon. Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"It is different, however, with respect to the order of
execution pending appeal granted by the trial court after perfection of the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that the execution
of a judgment is a proceeding affecting the rights of the parties, which are the
subject matter thereof, and from which appeal is taken, and its purpose is <u>not</u>
to protect and preserve the subject matter of the litigation (<span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span> vs. Imperial, 51 Phil., 251; <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Syquia</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
60 Phil., 186; De la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span>,
76 Phil., 718).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Summarizing, therefore, the above considerations, We find
that the trial court had jurisdiction to reconsider the approval of the record
on appeal, <u>solely for the purpose of ordering its completion or correction</u>;
<u>said order did not produce the effect of reviving the trial court's full
jurisdiction over the case</u>, <u>and said court still had no power to order
execution of its judg­ment pending appeal</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court's order of execution issued on <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1961</st1:date>, and the writ of
execution issued pursuant thereto, on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="5">May
 9, 1961</st1:date>, are, therefore, null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the execution had <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> should be set aside and the status quo
restored." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> Bros. Estate Inc.
vs. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
invoked by the plaintiffs, does not justify the order complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case involved the execution of an order
appointing the widow of a deceased person as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of his estate and ordering the former administrator, who had been removed as
such - by virtue of an order that had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
sometime before - to deliver to her certain records in his possession and
notifying the bank, in which some assets of said estate were deposited, of the
change of administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order
merely sought to protect and preserve the decedent's estate, because there was
no one in charge there­of since the removal of said former administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although an appeal had been taken from the
order appointing the new <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, the
aforementioned order directing the turn over of the records and notifying the
bank falls under one of the exceptions set forth in Section 9 of Rule 41 of the
Rules of Court, to which class the motion for execution of the plaintiffs in
the main case involved herein does not belong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
had not been authorized to dispose of any of the properties of the decedent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of respondent Judge dated April 20,
1965, and the writ of execution subsequently issued in compliance therewith are
null and void, and, hence, may not be enforced, with the costs of this instance
against respondents herein, except respondent Judge.</p>
