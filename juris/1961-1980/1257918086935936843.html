				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition was filed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cebu to obtain 
review of a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals dismissing his appeal from the 
ruling of the Collector (now Commissioner) of Internal Revenue of February 1,

<p>On the theory that the gross incomes in 1955 and 1956 were realized 
independently of the use of the building, furniture and fixtures, respondent 
totally disallowed the deductions for depreciation, thereby determining against 
petitioner, on July 15, 1956 and March 30, 1957, income tax liabilities for 1955 
and 1956 in the respective amounts of P1,825.00 and P2,493.00 (Exhibits "1-B" 
&amp; "2-B", pp. 17 &amp; 3, BIR rec.). On May 10 and 14, 1957, petitioner 
requested for the reconsideration of the determinations (Exhibits "G" &amp; "H", 
pp. 15-16 &amp; 12-13, BIR re.), which request were denied by respondent in a 
letter dated July 18, 1957, wherein he demanded the payment of P1,825.00 and 
P2,493.00, including 5% surcharge and 1% legal interest on the latter amount 
(Exhibit "3", pp. 18-23, BIR rec.). On August 28, 1957, petitioner requested for 
the reconsideration of the denial and the cancellation of the assessments 
(Exhibits "J", pp. 24-30, BIR rec.). On November 5, 1957, respondent denied this 
request for reconsideration and demanded the payment of P4,318.00, plus 
delinquency penalties incident to late payment (Exhibit "4'', pp. 36-37, BIR 
rec.). Again, on November 23, 1957, petitioner requested for the reconsideration 
and cancellation of the assessments (Exhibit "K", pp. 38-44, BIR rec.), which 
request was denied on January 20, 1958, with a demand 'for the last time to pay 
the total sum of P4,318.00 plus delinquency penalties incident to late payment 
immediately upon receipt hereof in order that no drastic action may be taken by 
this office on the matter" (Exhibit "5", pp. 45-46, BIR rec.).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on December 4, 1957, respondent issued a warrant of distraint and 
levy against the properties of the Roman Catholic Church of D. Jakosalem St., 
Cebu City, to satisfy the sums of P1,916.25 and P2,617.65 as deficiency income 
tax and surcharge due for 1955 and 1956.</p>
<p>On February 7, 1958, petitioner paid under protest the total amount of 
P5,201.52 as income tax for the years 1955 and 1956, including surcharge and 
interests. And on February 1, 1958, he filed before this Court his petition for 
review." (Annex "E", Petition, pp. 1-3)</p></blockquote>
<p>The respondent Collector (now Commissioner) of Internal Revenue set up 
several defenses, one of which is that petitioner failed to file a claim for 
refund of the taxes paid as required by Section 306 of the Tax Code, which claim 
for refund is allegedly mandatory and a condition precedent to an action for the 
recovery of the taxes paid; and the Tax Court, convinced that the lack of a 
claim for refund was fatal to petitioner's appeal, dismissed the same for lack 
of jurisdiction to take cognizance thereof. From this ruling, the petitioner 
appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>We agree with petitioner that Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125, creating 
the Court of Tax Appeals, in providing for appeals fromâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) Decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases involving 
disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, 
penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the 
National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of the law administered by 
the Bureau of Internal Revenue;",</p></blockquote>
<p>allows an appeal from a decision of the Collector in cases involving 
"disputed assessments'' as distinguished from cases involving "refunds of 
internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, * * *"; that the present 
action involves a "disputed assessment", because from the time petitioner 
received Assessments Nos. 17-EC-00301-55 and 17-AC-600107-56 disallowing certain 
deductions claimed by him in his income tax returns for the years 1955 and 1956, 
he already protested and refused to pay the same, questioning the correctness 
and legality of such assessments; and that the petitioner paid the disputed 
assessments under protest before filing his petition for review with the Court 
<i>a quo,</i> only to forestall the sale of his properties that had been placed 
under distraint by the respondent Collector since December 4, 1957. To hold that 
the taxpayer has now lost the right to appeal from the ruling on the disputed 
assessment but must prosecute his appeal under section 306 of the Tax Code, 
which requires a taxpayer to file a claim for refund of the taxes paid as a 
condition precedent to his right to appeal, would in effect require of him to go 
through a useless and needless ceremony that would only delay the disposition of 
the case, for the Collector (now Commissioner) would certainly disallow the 
claim for refund in the same way as he disallowed the protest against the 
assessment. The law should not be interpreted as to result in absurdities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we find the dismissal of petitioner's appeal to be 
substantially correct, for the reason that said appeal was not taken within the 
thirty (30) day period prescribed by section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125. The 
petitioner has submitted not less than three (3) motions or requests for the 
reconsideration of his Tax Assessments Nos. 17-EC-00301-55 and 17-AC-600107-56. 
The first he submitted to the Regional Director, and it was denied on July 18, 
1957; the second was on August 18, 1957, addressed to the Collector of Internal 
Revenue, and was denied by the latter on November 5, 1957, in a letter received 
by petitioner on November 21, 1957; and the third request was made on November 
23, 1957, and again denied on January 20, 1958, notified to petitioner on 
February 1, 1958. All motions for reconsideration were premised on the same 
grounds, deduction of the depreciation of the buildings in question. The appeal 
to the Tax Court was filed only on February 19, 1958.</p>
<p>By these successive motions for reconsideration, the petitioner managed to 
delay the review of his case by the Tax Court for nearly two years. Such delays 
are plainly inimical to the general interest, ascertainment and collection of 
taxes being essential to the maintenance of the State. The decision by the 
Collector of Internal Revenue dated November 5, 1957, denying the second request 
for reconsideration of the assessment, was certainly reviewable by the Court of 
Tax Appeals. Hence, the 30-day appeal, period should be counted from November 
21, 1957, when the taxpayer received copy of the Collector's ruling. The 
running of the period was not interrupted by the filing of the third request for 
reconsideration, because the latter did not advance new grounds not previously 
alleged, and was, therefore, merely <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span>. Therefore, petitioner's petition 
for review should have been lodged with the Tax Court not later than December 
21, 1957, but it was actually filed only on February 1, 1958.</p>
<p>Our ruling here is in line with the doctrine laid down by us in North 
Camarines Lumber Co. vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, (109 Phil., 511), 
wherein we held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As the petitioner had consumed thirty-three days, its appeal was clearly 
filed out of time. It is argued, however, that in computing the 30-day period 
fixed in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, the letter of the respondent 
Collector dated January 30, 1956, denying the second request for 
reconsideration, should be considered as the final decision contemplated in 
Section 7, and not the letter of demand dated August 30, 1955.</p>
<p>This contention is untenable. We cannot countenance the theory that would 
make the commencement of the statutory 30-day period solely dependent on the 
will of the taxpayer and place the latter in a position to put off indefinitely 
and at his convenience the finality of a tax assessment. Such an absurd 
procedure would be detrimental to the interest of the Government, for 'taxes are 
the lifeblood of the government, and their prompt and certain availability an 
imperious need.' (Bull vs. U. S. 295, U. S. 247)."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the dismissal of the petitioner's appeal by the 
Court of Tax Appeals is hereby affirmed. Costs against the petitioner.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon, </i>and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.
