equivalent portion of the liability from such original insurances.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1951, Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. filed its Philippine income tax 
return for 1950, claiming therein, among others, a deduction of P37.147.04 as 
net addition to marine insurance reserve equivalent to 40% of the gross marine 
insurance premiums received during the year. The Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue disallowed P11<span class="GramE">,772.57</span> of such claim for 
deduction and subsequently assessed against Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. the sum 
of Pl,884.00 as deficiency income tax. The disallowance resulted from the fixing 
by the Commissioner of the net addition to the marine insurance reserve at 100% 
of the marine insurance premiums received during the last three months of the 
year. The Commissioner assumed that "ninety and thirty days are approximately 
the length of time required before shipments reach their destination or before 
claims are received by the insurance companies.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1953 Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. filed its Philippine income tax 
return for 1952, declaring therein a deduction from gross income of P35<span class="GramE">,912.25</span> as part of the head office expenses incurred for its 
Philippine business, computed at 5% on its gross Philippine income.</p>
<p>On August 30, 1055 it amended its income tax return for 1952 by excluding 
from its' gross income the amount of P316,526.75 representing reinsurance 
premiums ceded to foreign <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> and further 
eliminating deductions corresponding to the ceded premiums. The amended return 
showed an income tax due in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,502.00</span>. 
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed P15<span class="GramE">,826.35</span> of the claimed deduction for head office expenses and 
assessed a deficiency tax of P5, 667.00 on <st1:date month="7" day="24" year="1958">July 24,1958</st1:date>.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1954">April 30, 1954</st1:date> Phoenix 
Assurance Co., Ltd. filed its Philippine income tax return for 1953 and claimed 
therein a deduction from gross income of P33<span class="GramE">,070.88</span> as 
head office expenses allocable to its Philippine business, equivalent to 5% of 
its gross Philippine income. On <st1:date month="8" day="30" year="1955">August 
30, 1955</st1:date> it amended its 1953 income tax return to exclude from its 
gross income the amount of P246<span class="GramE">,082.04</span> representing 
reinsurance premiums ceded to foreign <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>. At 
the same time it requested the refund of P23<span class="GramE">,409.00</span> as 
overpaid income tax for 1953. To avoid the prescriptive period provided for in 
Section 306 of the Tax Code, it filed a petition for review on <st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1956">August 11, 1956</st1:date> in the Court of Tax 
Appeals praying for such refund. After verification of the amended income lax 
return the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed P12.304.10 of the 
deduction representing head office expenses allocable to Philippine business 
thereby reducing the refundable amount to P20<span class="GramE">,180.00</span>.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1955">April 29, 1955</st1:date> Phoenix 
Assurance Co., Ltd. filed Philippine income tax return for 1954 claiming 
therein, among others, a deduction from gross income of P29<span class="GramE">,624.75</span> as head office expenses allocable to its Philippine 
Business, computed at 5% of its gross Philippine income. It also excluded from 
its gross income the amount of P203<span class="GramE">,384.69</span> representing 
reinsurance premiums ceded to foreign <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> not 
doing business in the

deficiency income tax in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,667.00</span>. The 
Court of Tax Appeals found the right of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
barred by prescription, the same having been exercised more than live years from 
the date the original return was filed. On the other hand, the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue insists that his right to issue the assessment has not 
prescribed inasmuch as the same was availed of before the 5-year period provided 
for in Section 331 of the Tax Code expired, counting the running of the period 
from August 30, 1955, the date when the amended return was filed.</p>
<p>Section 331 of the Tax Code, which limits the right of the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue to assess income tax within five years from the filing of the 
income tax return, states:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SEC. 331.</span> <i>Period of limitation upon assessment 
and collection</i><span class="GramE">.—</span> Except as provided in the 
succeeding section, internal-revenue taxes shall be assessed within five years 
after the return was filed, and no proceeding in court without assessment for 
the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period. 
For the purposes of thin section a return filed before the last day prescribed 
by law for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day: 
Provided, <span class="GramE">That</span> this limitation shall not apply to cases 
already investigated prior to the approval of this Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>The question is: Should the running of the prescriptive period commence from 
the filing of the original or amended return?</p>
<p>The Court of Tax Appeals ruled that the original return was a complete return 
containing "information on various items of income and deduction from which 
respondent may intelligently compute and determine the tax liability of 
petitioner", hence, the .prescriptive period should be counted from the filing 
of said original return. On the other hand, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
maintains that:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"* * * the deficiency income tax in question could not possibly he 
determined, or assessed, on the basis of the original return filed on April 1, 
1953, for considering that the declared loss amounted to P199<span class="GramE">,583.93</span>, the mere disallowance of part of the head office 
expense could not possibly result in said loss being completely wiped out and 
Phoenix being liable to deficiency tax. Not until the amended return was filed 
on <st1:date month="8" day="30" year="1955">August 30, 1955</st1:date> could the 
Commissioner assess the deficiency income tax in question."</p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, he would wish to press for the counting of the prescriptive 
period from the filing of the amended return.</p>
<p>To our mind, the Commissioner's view should he sustained. The changes and 
alterations embodied in the amended income tax return consisted of the exclusion 
of reinsurance premiums received from domestic insurance companies by Phoenix 
Assurance Co., <span class="SpellE">Ltd.'s</span> London head office, reinsurance 
premiums ceded to foreign <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> not doing 
business in the Philippines and various items of deduction attributable to such 
excluded reinsurance premiums, thereby substantially modifying the original 
return. Furthermore, although the deduction for head office expenses allocable 
to Philippine business, whose disallowance gave rise to the deficiency tax, was 
claimed also in the original return, the Commissioner could not have possibly 
determined a deficiency tax <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> because Phoenix 
Assurance Co., Ltd. declared a loss of P199<span class="GramE">,583.93</span> 
therein which would have more than offset such disallowance of P15,826.35. 
Considering that the deficiency assessment was based on the amended return 
which, as afore-stated, is substantially different from the original return, the 
period of limitation of the right to issue the same should be counted from the 
filing of the amended income tax return. From August 30, 1955, when the amended 
return was filed, to July 24, 1958, when the deficiency assessment was issued, 
less than five years elapsed. The right of .the Commissioner to assess the 
deficiency tax on such amended return has not prescribed.</p>
<p>To strengthen our opinion, we believe that to hold otherwise, we would be 
paving the way for taxpayers to evade the payment of taxes by simply reporting 
in their original return heavy losses and amending the same more than five years 
later when the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has lost his authority to assess 
the proper tax <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>. The object of the Tax Code 
is to impose taxes for the needs of the Government, not to enhance tax avoidance 
to its prejudice.</p>
<p>We next consider Phoenix Assurance Co., <span class="SpellE">Ltd.'s</span> 
claim for deduction of P37<span class="GramE">,147.04</span> for 1950 representing 
net addition to reserve computed at 40% of the marine insurance premiums 
received during the year. Treating said deduction to be excessive, the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue reduced the same to P25<span class="GramE">,374.47</span> which is equivalent to 100% of all marine insurance 
premiums received during the last three months of the year.</p>
<p>Paragraph (a) of Section 32 of the Tax Code states:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">"SEC. 32.</span> <i>Special provisions regarding income and 
deductions of insurance companies, whether domestic or foreign.—(a) Special 
deduction allowed to insurance companies.</i>—In the case of insurance 
companies, whether domestic or foreign, the net additions, if any, required by 
law to be made within the year to reserve funds and the sums other than 
dividends paid within the year on policy and annuity contracts may be deducted 
from, their grogs income."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 186 of the Insurance Law requires the setting up of reserves for 
liability on marine insurance:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Section 186<span class="GramE">. "</span>* * * <i>Provided, That for marine 
risks the insuring company shall be required to charge as the liability for 
reinsurance fifty per centum of the premiums written in the policies upon yearly 
risks, and the full premiums written in the policies upon alt other marine risks 
not terminated."</i> (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The reserve required for marine insurance is determined on two bases: 50% of 
premiums under policies on yearly risks and 100 % of premiums under policies of 
marine risks not terminated during the year.<span class="style11"><sup>*</sup></span> Section 32 (a) of the Tax Code quoted above 
allows the full amount of such reserve to be deducted from gross income.</p>
<p>It may be noteworthy to observe that the formulas for determining the marine 
reserve employed by Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. and the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue—40% of premiums received during the year and 100% of premiums received 
during the last three months of the year, respectively—do not comply with 
Section 186. Said determinations run short of the requirement. For purposes of 
the Insurance Law, this Court therefore cannot countenance the same. The reserve 
called for in Section 186 is a safeguard to the general public and should be 
strictly followed not only because it is an express provision but also as a 
matter of public policy. However, for income tax purposes a taxpayer is free to 
deduct from its gross income a lesser amount, or not to claim any deduction at 
all. What is prohibited by the income tax law is to claim a deduction beyond the 
amount authorized therein.</p>
<p>Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd/s claim for deduction of P37<span class="GramE">,147.01</span> being less than the amount required in Section 186 of 
the Insurance Law, the same cannot be and is not excessive, and should therefore 
be fully allowed.</p>
<p>We come now to the controversy on the taxpayer's claim for deduction on head 
office expenses incurred during 1952, 1953 and 1954 allocable to its Philippine 
business computed at 5% on its <i>gross income</i> in the Philippines. The 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue <span class="SpellE">redetermined</span> such 
deduction at 5% on Phoenix Assurance Co., <span class="SpellE">Ltd.'s</span> 
<i>net income</i> thereby partially disallowing the latter's claim. The parties 
are agreed as to the percentage—5%—but differ as to the basis of computation. 
Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. insists that the 5% head office expenses be 
determined from the <i>gross income</i>, while the Commissioner wants the 
computation to be made on the <i>net income</i>. What, therefore, needs to be 
resolved is: Should the 5% be computed on the gross or net income?</p>
<p>The record shows that the gross income of Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. 
consists of income from its Philippic business as well as reinsurance premiums 
received for its head office in London and reinsurance premiums c to foreign 
<span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>. Since the items of income belonging to its 
Philippine business are not taxable to Philippine branch, they should be 
excluded in the head office expenses allocable to said Philippine branch. This 
conclusion finds support in paragraph 2, subsection (a), Section 30 of the Tax 
Code, quoted hereunder:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"(2) Expenses allowable to non-resident alien individual and foreign 
corporations.—In thee case of a non-resident alien individual or a foreign 
corporation, the expenses deductible are the n expenses paid or incurred in 
carrying on any business or trade conducted within the Philippines exclusively." 
(Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Consequently, the deficiency assessments for 1952<span class="GramE">,1953</span> and 1954, resulting from partial disallowance of 
deduction representing head office expenses, are sustained.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assails the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the Tax Court's decision limiting the 
maximum amount of interest collectible for delinquency to an account 
corresponding to a period of .throe years. He contends that since such 
limitation we incorporated into Section 51 of the Tax Code by Republic Act 2343 
which took effect only on June 20, 1959, it must not be applied retroactively on 
withholding tax for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954.</p>
<p>The imposition of interest on unpaid taxes is one of the statutory penalties 
for tax delinquency, from the payments of which the Court of Tax Appeals 
absolved the Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. on the equitable ground that the 
latter's failure to pay the withholding tax was due to the Commissioner's 
opinion that no withholding tax was due. Consequently, the taxpayer could be 
liable for the payment of statutory penalties only upon its failure to comply 
with the. Tax Court's judgment rendered on February 14, 1962, after Republic Act 
2343 took effect. This part of the ruling of the court ought not to be 
disturbed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is modified. Phoenix Assurance Co., 
Ltd. is hereby ordered to pay the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the amount of 
p75,966.42, P59,059.68 and P48,812.32 as withholding tax for the years 1952, 
1953 and 1954, respectively, and the sums of P5,667.00 and P2,847.00 as income 
tax for 1952 and 1954 or a total of P192,352.42. The Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue is ordered to refund to Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd. the amount of 
P20<span class="GramE">,180.00</span> as overpaid income tax for 1953, which 
should be deducted from the amount of P192,352.42.</p>
<p>If the amount of P192<span class="GramE">,352.42</span> or a portion thereof is 
not paid within thirty (30) days from the date this judgment becomes final, 
there shall be collected a surcharge and interest as provided for in Section 51 
(e) (2) of the Tax Code. No costs. It is so ordered.</p>
