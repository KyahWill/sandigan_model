the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">, </span>pursuant
to a verbal agreement forged between the parties, issued an order requiring

<blockquote>"OPPOSITOR admits that petitioner is the legitimate mother of

is the legally adopted child of the late FELIX L. <st1:state><st1:place>DEL</st1:place></st1:state>
ROSARIO and DOROTEA DEL ROSARIO CONANAN.</blockquote>

<st1:city><st1:place>ROSARIO</st1:place></st1:city> died last September 12,

<blockquote>"That the only surviving nearest relatives <span style="">of </span>deceased FELIX L. DEL ROSARIO are
the petitioner and <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> DOROTEA O. CONANAN and
MARILOU DEL ROSARIO.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Parties admit to pay their respective counsel in the amount

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully <span style="">prayed </span>of this Honorable Court that on
the basis of the facts stipulated, the Court declare the heirs <span style="">of </span>the deceased" (pp. 9-10,
rec.).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1973</st1:date>,
the lower court issued the challenged order, pertinent portions of which read:</p>

<blockquote>"A perusal of the petition shows that the instant case was
filed under the provisions of Section 2, Rule 74 of the Revised Rules of Court,
which reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Whenever the gross value of the estate of a deceased person, whether
he died testate or intestate, does not exceed ten<span style=""> thousand pesos, and that </span>fact is made to appear to the Court of
First Instance having jurisdiction of the estate by the petition of an
interested person and upon hearing, which shall be held not less than one (1)
month nor more than three (3) months from the date of the last publication of <span style="">a </span>notice which shall be published once
a week for three (3) con­secutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation
in the province, and after such other notice to interested persons as the court
may direct, the court may proceed summarily, without the appointment of an
executor or administrator, and without delay, to grant, if proper, allowance of
the will, if any there is, to determine who are the persons legally entitled to
participate in the estate, and to apportion and divide it among them after the
payment of such debts of the estate as the court shall then find to be due; and
such persons, in their own right, if they are of lawful age and legal capacity,
or by their guardians or trustees legally appointed and qualified, if
otherwise, shall thereupon be entitled to receive and enter into the possession
of the portions of the estate so awarded <span style="">to
</span>them respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
shall make such order as may be just respecting the costs of the proceedings,
and all orders and judgment made or rendered in the course thereof shall be
recorded in the office of the clerk, and the order of partition or award, if it
involves real estate, shall be recorded in the proper registrar's office.</p>

<blockquote>"While it may be true that a petition for summary settlement
is allowed under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of the
rules, the same rule specifically limits the action to estates the gross value
of which does not exceed P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant petition, however, clearly
alleges that the value of the real properties alone left by the deceased Felix
del Rosario amounts to P33,000.00 which is obviously over and above the value
of the estate allowed under the rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The action taken by the petitioner (cannot be) construed as one filed
under an intestate proceeding as the requirements provided by law for the same
has not been complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on the
foregoing observation alone, the petition must perforce be dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But granting <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arguendo</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>that
this Court may consider the petition as an exercise <span style="">(of) </span>the powers of a probate Court in determining and declaring
the heirs of the deceased as prayed for in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
partial joint stipulation of facts, the law on intestate succession is clear
that an adopted child concurring with the surviving spouse of the adopter
excludes the legitimate ascendants from succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention of the petitioner that Article 343 is
applicable in the instant <span style="">case </span>finds
no basis for the said article is applicable in cases where there are no other
concurring intestate heirs of the adopted child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Based on the foregoing, therefore, the petitioner not being
included as intestate heir of the deceased cannot be considered as <span style="">a </span>co-owner of or have any right over
the properties sought to be partitioned and under the pro<span style="">visions of Section 1, Rule 69 in relation to
Section 2, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of Court, such action must be </span><span style="">commenced or instituted by the </span><span style="">party in interest.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing
findings, the Court hereby DISMISSES the petition without pronounce­ment as to
costs" (pp. 10-12, rec.).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1973</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a notice of appeal, record on appeal and appeal bond (see
respondents' comments, p. 18, <span class="GramE">rec</span>.).</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">WE rule that on purely jurisdictional consideration, the instant
petition should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, in a litany of precedents dating as far back as the 1938
case of <span class="SpellE">Utulo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pasiono</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Garcia (66 Phil. 302) and
reaffirmed in <st1:city><st1:place>Asuncion</st1:place></st1:city> and Castro
vs. De la Cruz (No. <span class="GramE">L-7855, </span><st1:date year="1955" day="23" month="11"><span class="GramE">November 23, 1955</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 97 Phil. 910) and Gutierrez vs. Cruz (G.R. No.</span> L-21027,
July 20, 1968, 24 SCRA 69), WE uniformly held that for the court to acquire
jurisdiction in a petition for summary settlement of estate under the rules,
the requirement that the amount of the estate involved should not exceed
P10,000.00 (P6,000.00 under the old rules) is jurisdictional.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, both parties jointly affirmed that the value
of the realty left by the deceased Felix del Rosario is in the aggregate amount
of P33<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which, as the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
correctly found, is obviously "over and above the value allowed under the
rules."</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">However, by virtue of the transcendental implications of the
holding of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, in the sense that once wholly
sustained, said holding would preclude petitioner from re-filing the proper
action - <span style="">a</span> consequence which, on
the grounds of equity and fair play, WE cannot allow to befall on petitioner -
WE deem it essential, for the guidance of the parties, especially herein
petitioner, to point out the demerits of the appealed verdict.</p>

<p class="BODY">A couple of important issues are posed for our consideration, <span style="">to </span>wit:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Which of the following articles of the New Civil Code will
apply, Article 343 on the one hand, or Articles 341, 978 and 979 on the other;
and</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Whether the material data rule enunciated by Rule 41, Section 6
of the New Rules of Court should be followed, <u>ex</u> <u>cathedra</u>, in the
present case.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">A</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court found the following provisions of the New Civil
Code germane to the instant case:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 341.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The adoption
shall:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1) Give to the
adopted person the same rights and duties as if he were a legitimate child of
the adopter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) <span class="GramE">Dissolve</span> the authority vested in the
parents by nature;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) <span class="GramE">Make</span> the adopted person a legal heir
of the adopter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4) <span class="GramE">Entitle</span> the adopted person to use the
adopter's surname."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 978<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Succession</span> pertains, in the first place, to the descending direct
line."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 979<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Legitimate</span> children and their descendants succeed the parents and
other ascendants, without distinction as to sex or age, and even if they should
come from different marriages."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">WE opine that the governing provision is the hereinafter quoted
Article 343 of the New Civil Code, in relation to Articles 893 and 1000 of said
law, which directs that:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 343<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If</span> the adopter is survived by legitimate parents or ascendants
and by an adopted person, the latter shall not have more <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights than an acknowledged natural child."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 343 of the New Civil Code is qualifi­cation to Article
341 which gives an adopted child the same rights and duties as though he were a
legitimate child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this is
that:</p>

<blockquote>"(I<span class="GramE">)t</span> is
unjust to exclude the adopter's parents from the inheritance in favor of an adopted
person" (Report of the Code Commissioner, p. 92).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is most unfair to accord more <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights to the adopted, who is only related artificially by fiction of law to
the deceased, than those who are naturally related to him by blood in the
direct ascending line.</p>

<p class="BODY">The applicability of Article 343 does not exclude the surviving
parent of the deceased adopter, not only because a contrary view would defeat
the intent of the framers of the law, but also because in intestate succession,
where legitimate parents or ascendants concur with the surviving <span style="">spouse </span>of <span style="">the deceased, the latter does not necessarily exclude the former from
the inheritance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is affirmed by
Article 893 of the New Civil Code which states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"If the testator leaves no legitimate descendants, but leaves
legitimate ascendants, the surviving spouse shall have a right to one-fourth
(only) of the hereditary estate.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"This fourth shall be
taken from the free portion."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 343 does not require that the concurring heirs should be
the adopted child and the legitimate parents or ascendants only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The language of the law <span style="">is </span>clear, and a contrary view cannot
be presumed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, thus, OUR view that Article 343 should be made to apply,
consonant with the cardinal rule <span style="">in
statutory construction </span>that all <span style="">the
</span>provisions <span style="">of the </span><span style="">New </span>Civil
Code <span style="">must </span>be reconciled and
given <span style="">effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 343, an adopted child surviving with legitimate
parents of the deceased <span class="GramE">adopter,</span> has the same <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights as an acknowledged natural child, which
is comprehended in the term "illegitimate children".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the respective shares of the
surviving spouse, ascendant and adopted child should be determined by Article
1000 of the New Civil Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1000<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If</span> legitimate ascendants, the surviving spouse and illegitimate
children are left, the ascendants shall be entitled to one-half of the
inheritance, and the other half shall be divided between the surviving spouse
and the illegitimate children so that such widow or widower shall have
one-fourth of the estate, the illegitimate children the other fourth."</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">B</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the other issue, respondents, in their comment of June 29,
1973, emphasize that the petitioner's record on appeal violates the material
data rule in that</p>

<blockquote>"It does not state when the notice of appeal and appeal bond
were filed with the lower court in disregard of the requirement of Section 6,
Rule 41 of the Rules of Court that the record on appeal must contain such data
as will show that the appeal was perfected on time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Recent jurisprudence has construed liberally the material data
rule, whenever circumstances and substantial justice warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The cases of <span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-36629, September 28, 1973
(53 SCRA 228) and Villanueva vs. Court of Appeals (No.</span> L-29719, November
28, 1975, 68 SCRA 216, 220) are particularly in point.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Villanueva, WE held:</p>

<blockquote>"The deviation from the rigid <span style="">rule adopted in the </span>case of Government of <span style="">the Philippines vs. Antonio, et al., G.R. <span class="GramE">No</span>. </span><span style="">L-23736, </span><span style="">October 19, 1965, is due to our realization
that after all what is of vital importance in the requirement of Section <span class="GramE">6,</span> Rule 41 of the Rules of Court is that the Record on
Appeal shall show that the appeal was really perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it could be ascertained from the record of the case that the appeal
was perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period,
although such fact did not evidently appear on the face of the record on
appeal, the defect or deficiency is not fatal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>If the appellate court is </u><u><span style="">con­</span>vinced that the appeal was perfected on time, it should not
throw </u><u><span style="">out but </span>assume
jurisdiction over it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, that
procedural requirement </u><u><span style="">is </span>only
intended to enable the appellate court to determine if the appeal </u><u><span style="">is </span>still within its jurisdiction and
nothing more</u>" <span style="">(Villanueva vs.
Court of Appeals, 68 SCRA 220, underscoring supplied).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the docket and process slip of this case, it is shown that
the date of notice of the Court of First Instance decision is July 3, 1973 and
that the expiry date to file petition for <i>certiorari</i> with <span style="">the Supreme Court is December 14, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed her notice </span>of appeal,
appeal bond and record <span style="">on appeal on
July 10, 1973 - or still very much within </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">perfect an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And although
this is not </span><span style="">mentioned in the
record on appeal, it is, nevertheless, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">fact of record, the
veracity </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">which this COURT does not doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Perforce, there being substantial compliance <span style="">with </span>the requirement of the Rules of
Court, WE resolve this issue in favor <span style="">of
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">liberal
interpretation </span>of <span style="">the </span>material
data rule aimed at serving the ends <span style="">of
substantial justice </span>has found amplification in the recent cases of <span style="">Pimentel, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et
