<p class="BODY" style="">It is the contention of petitioner
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span> in this <i>certiorari</i> proceeding
by way of review of a decision of the Court of Industrial Relations that his
employment <span style="">was </span>termi­nated after
five months of service as chief mechanical engineer and plant superintendent
with private respondent, allegedly for "no other cause than his active
participation in the formation of the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Technical

Respondent Court, however, in its decision, concluded "that Mr. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span> was employed by the respondent company only on a

his employment could be terminated at the pleasure of the employer, the
respondent herein."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Moreover, it likewise concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Consequently, the charge that his

been denied, the matter was elevated to this Court in this <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Notwithstanding the very
able brief for the petitioner filed </span><span style="">by the </span><span style="">Mendoza and
Fernandez law firm, with its exhaustive discussion of the legal issues
involved, this Court, in the light of the facts as found, finds no justifiable
basis for reversal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of whether
or not petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span> had a fixed tenure of
employment, the decision sought to be reviewed appraised the facts as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"From the foregoing, we
are convinced that the complainant, Mr. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>,
was employed in the respondent company as Chief Mechanical Engineer and Plant
Superintendent only on a trial basis or in a temporary capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the probationary period of
three months was extended for another two months did not change the temporary
character of complainant's employment in the respondent company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is more so because the reason for the
extension had been clearly explained by no less than three witnesses for the
respondent, including for that matter Mr. Ricardo Perez who, admittedly, was
the very same person who introduced and recommended Mr. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span> for employment with the respondent company and who,
again, interceded for the complainant in having his services extended for
another two months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Even the
complainant himself was not certain whether or not he would be employed
permanently or be fired out of job; that he was only told by the management
that he could continue working; * * * and he knew that there was no definite or
fixed term for him to work as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's
pretense that he was already a permanent employee after the probationary period
of three months is hardly acceptable for it does not jibe with the
circumstances then obtaining in the respondent company as it was just start­ing
operation with the advent or arrival of new machineries from abroad and
everything was then on trial basis including for that matter the choice by the
respondent company for a very high and responsible official to occupy the
position of Plant Superintendent and Chief Mechanical Engineer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, we are constrained
to conclude that Mr. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span> was employed by
the respondent company only on a temporary (trial) capacity without any fixed
tenure of employment and as such, his employment could be terminated at the
pleasure of the employer, the respondent herein."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a finding of fact, supported as it was by substantial evidence, is
entitled to full respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has been
decided by this Court time and time again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As was pointed out in Phil. Educational Institution v. <span class="SpellE">MLQSEA</span> Faculty Association,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice Laurel, "in the first decision, promulgated in 1939, concerning
the scope of the power of this Court to alter factual conclusions reached by
the Court of Industrial Relations, expressed the view that we should not
disturb 'the findings of facts made by the Court of Industrial Relations * *
*.' A year and two months later on November, 1940, he was much more
definite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such findings 'are conclusive
and will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing [of abuse of] discretion.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

National Labor Union.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The latest case in point, decided less than
a year ago, is National Labor Union v. Court of Industrial Relations.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did respondent Court
of Industrial Relations neglect to pass upon the claim of petitioner that his
services were terminated for "no other cause than his active participation
in the formation of the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Technical Union."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
As noted at the outset, respondent Court reached this conclusion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Consequently, the charge that his
dismissal was due to union membership and activities <span style="">is unfounded."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It explained why:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Apparently, manage­ment came to know of
this organization and so expressed its disapproval thereof on the claim that it
is against the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elucidating on this
point, Col. <span class="SpellE">Mariñas</span>, the personnel manager of
respondent, on cross examination by counsel for the complainant, [petitioner]
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'[Atty. Mendoza] Q - So you had
occasion to inform Mr. Castillo that the <span class="SpellE">AFTO</span> proposed
to include both supervisors and workers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is that right?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - I saw them in
the list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q - So you had occasion to
inform Mr. Castillo that you saw in the list members and prospective members of
the <span class="SpellE">AFTO</span> both workers and supervisors?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>A - Yes, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q - That was before Mr. <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>
<span style="">was </span>separated from the
company?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - <span style="">Yes, </span>sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q - Did Mr.
Castillo not tell you or instruct you to do anything to stop the organization
of the <span class="SpellE">AFTO</span> because it was against the law?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - Well, he just told me it was against the
law and he did not want it like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
feels we might be part of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q - That
is all he told you?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - That is all he
told.' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 69-71, <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1962</st1:date>) That the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">AFTO</span></span><span style=""> is of </span>mixed membership among the supervisors and ordinary workers
is every explicit from the document evidencing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is likewise admitted by <span style="">no less </span>than the complainant himself
when he testified on direct exami­nation as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Q - Who are those persons whom you
approached to sign?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - Well, I
approached the heads of the department as technicians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[The Court] The names?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A - And then Mr. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
I do not recall his first name - the superintendent of the Preparatory
Department; Mr. Passion of the refrigeration department; Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rueda</span>, the spinning department; and then Mr. Ricardo Perez,
the boiler superintendent and the electrician and many others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not recall all of them but I got in
touch with the heads and subheads of the finishing department, a certain Mr.
Acosta and <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> Romero, I approached those who are
supposed to be technicians and personnel and all that.' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pp. 16-17, <st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="12">Dec. 17, 1960</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the personnel manager of the respon­dent
company further stated on the improper composition of the organization sought
to be established:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A - Because the
title of the organization says it is a technicians organization and the members
we found out are not technicians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
cannot expect the office to like it.' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp.
20, <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1962</st1:date>; also
pp. 8 and 61, <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1962</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For being the plant superintendent and Chief
Mechanical Engineer, as well as a key man in the respondent company, (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Jan. 27, 1963), it cannot be doubted that he (Mr.
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>) cannot lawfully organize a labor
union [composed] of the men under his supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prohibition is explicitly provided for
in Section 3 of the Industrial Peace Act:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'* * * Individuals employed as supervisors shall not be eligible for
membership in a labor organization of employees under their supervision but may
form a separate organization of their own.' For this, a supervisor, the
complainant for that matter, may be dismissed without subjecting the employer
to prosecution under the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
also the rule in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
after whose law our own Industrial Peace Act has been patterned."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>This is another finding of fact that
must <span style="">remain undisturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the charge of private
respondent having committed an unfair labor practice falls to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was held in <span class="SpellE">Genconsu</span>
Free Workers Union v. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> not only the latest case <span style="">in point but also a reiteration of the
applicability of such </span>principle to a controversy, the proven facts of
which display the closest similarity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is no occasion
to pass upon the allegation in the petition that certain discriminatory acts,
anti-union in character, could be attributed to private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Deputy Minister of Labor and the
National Labor Relations Commission absolved it from such a charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a finding of fact to which deference
must be paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That norm has invariably
been followed by this Court."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Under the circumstances, the rather cogent
presentation of the Mendoza and Hernandez law firm as to the limits that must
