				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 46525 of the Court of First Instance of Manila
the Court denied appellant's petition to have <span style="">his </span>name as recorded in the Local Civil Registry of the City of
Manila corrected so as to make it <span style="">read </span>SENCIO
YU instead of <span style="">SINCIO C. YEE, </span>on
the ground that the correction sought was substantial and not within the
meaning of the provisions of Article 412 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's verified petition alleged that he was born <span style="">on </span>May 16, 1967 in the City of Manila,
Chinese citizens Yu <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Koo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Oh <span class="SpellE">Yek</span> being his
parents; that he was re­gistered in the Bureau of Immigration under the name of
<span class="SpellE">Sincio</span> C. Yu; that the fact of his birth had been
entered in the Office of the Local Civil Registrar for the City of Manila under
Registry No. 1543 (e37) under the name of <span class="SpellE">Sin­cio</span> Yee;
that a mistake was committed in said entry as a result of the report made by
the Chinese midwife who as­sisted in his delivery who wrote his name as "<span class="SpellE">Sincio</span>", <span style="">instead
of "<span class="SpellE">Sencio</span>", and spelled his surname as
"Yee", instead of as "Yu".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Attached to the petition were a cer­tified true copy of appellant’s
birth certificate and the affidavits of his father and the aforementioned
midwife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> filed an opposition alleging that the
desired correction did not partake of the nature of a clerical error but was
substantial in character, and, therefore, did not fall within the meaning of
Article 412 of the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the hearing, the
Solicitor representing <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> withdrew his objection
to the change of the family name of appellant from "Yee" to
"Yu" since it appeared from appellant's original record of birth that
his surname was not "Yee" but "Yu" - his father's surname -
(trans. of August 10, 1961, p. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is obvious that the
only issue in the instant case is whether the change of appellant's name from “<span class="SpellE">Sincio</span>” to "<span class="SpellE">Sencio</span>"
involves a mere clerical error or, as the lower court held, it involves
"already a change of name" and must</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">therefore, be obtained in "another petition".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the facts <span class="SpellE">setforth</span> above, <span class="GramE">We</span> are of the
opinion, and so hold, that what </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">involved in this case is merely the
correction of a mistake in appellant's <span class="SpellE">christian</span>
named.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To change "<span class="SpellE">Sincio</span>" into "<span class="SpellE">Sencio</span>",
which merely involves the substitution of the first vowel "<span class="SpellE">i</span>" in the first name into the vowel "e"
amounts merely to the righting of a </span><span style="">clerical</span><span style=""> error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A
</span><span style="">clerical error has been defined
as one made "in copying or writing" (Black's Law Dictionary; In re -
Stewart N.Y.S. 957, 966).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has also
been held that a misspelled word is a clerical error (<span class="SpellE">Amicon</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Holtc</span> 160 N.E. 482 – 483).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In the
case of <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> vs. Republic of the </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="">; 102 Phil. 1046; 540 Off.</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 5886, We
held the clerical errors correctible through judicial sanction under Article
412 of the New Civil Code would be "those harmless and innocuous changes,
such as correction of a name that </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">clearly misspelled; etc."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And in <span class="SpellE">Barillo</span>
vs. Republic of the </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="">, G.R. No.</span></span><span style=""> L-14823, December 23, 1961, We reiterated
the same view to the effect that the correction authorized under Article 412 of
the New Civil Code are harmless and innocuous changes, such as the correction
of a name that is clearly misspelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed and set
aside and, as a consequence, appellant's petition is granted so that he may
heretofore use the name "SENCIO YU", and with the further result that
<span style="">his name </span>appearing in the
Office of the Local Civil Registrar for the City of Manila under Registry No.
1543 should also be changed correspondingly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span></p>
