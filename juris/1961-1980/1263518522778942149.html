<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1964</st1:date>,
before the appellate court's decision dismissing <span class="GramE">Socorro' s</span>
petition became final, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> filed with the
appellate court his claim for damages in the amount of P199,000 on account of
the wrongful issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court denied <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> claim, for want of bad faith and malice on the
part of Socorro in filing his petition and securing the <span style="">issuance of the </span>writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> subsequent
motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review the
resolution of the Court of Appeals denying his claim for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> contends that the respondent
appellate court erred in denying his claim for damages on the ground of want of
bad faith and malice on the part of the respondent Socorro in filing the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> re the main case and securing the issuance of
the writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
invokes the provisions of Section 9, Rule 58 in relation to Section 20, Rule
57, of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 9,
Rule 58 recites:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><u>"Judgment to include damages against
party and sureties</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Upon
the trial the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, or to the
defendant, as the case may be, upon the bond of the other party, shall be
claimed, ascertained, and awarded under the same procedure as prescribed in
Section 20 of Rule 57."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 20, Rule 57 reads:</p>

<blockquote><u>"Claim for damages on account of illegal attachment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If the judgment on the action be in favor
of the party against whom attachment was issued, he may recover, upon the bond
given or deposit made <span style="">by the attaching
creditor, any </span><span style="">damages resulting from the attachment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such damages maybe awarded only upon application </span><span style="">and after proper hearing, and shall be
included in the final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
applica­tion must be filed before the trial or before appeal is perfected or
before the judgment becomes <span class="SpellE">execu­tory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With due notice to the
attaching creditor and his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing
his right to damages and the amount thereof.</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the judgment of the appellate court be fa­vorable to <span style="">the </span>p<span style="">arty against whom the </span>attachment was issued, he must claim
damages sustained during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal
by filing an application with <span style="">notice to
the party </span><span style="">in whose favor the attachment </span><span style="">was</span><span style=""> issued or his </span><span style="">surety <span style="">or sureties, before the </span></span><span style="">judgment of the </span><span style="">appellate court
becomes <span class="SpellE">executo­ry</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">The
appellate </span><span style="">court may allow the application </span><span style="">to heard and </span><span style="">decided </span><span style="">by the </span><span style="">trial court."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> points out that the said
provisions do not require a claimant who seeks to recover <span style="">damages on account of the wrong­</span>ful
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, <span style="">to prove </span>bad faith and malice on the part of the party <span style="">who obtained the issuance of the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>To reinforce his contention, he <span style="">invokes the provisions </span>of Section 4(b)
of Rule 58 of <span style="">the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
avers, makes the </span>party applying <span style="">for
</span>an <span style="">injunction liable for all da­</span>mages
sustained by <span style="">the other party if the
court finally decides the </span>party applicant as <span style="">not entitled thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He maintains
that, in the </span>case at bar, the dissolution of the writ of <span style="">preliminary injunction </span><span style="">by the respondent appellate court clearly <span style="">demonstrates that the respondent </span>Socorro
was not entitled thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Socorro, on the other hand, prays <span style="">for the dismissal of the present </span>petition on the following
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="GramE">The</span>
<span style="">petitioner </span>"re­fused <span style="">to </span>prosecute his claim for damages
.... <span class="GramE">in</span> the main action then already on appeal to this
Court;" (2) <span style="">The petitioner
"failed to state in </span>his motion claiming for <span style="">damages the facts upon which his </span>rights thereto are based;"
(3) The <span style="">petitioner, </span>if <span style="">"suing on the bond .... </span><span class="GramE">has</span> no more cause of action as <span style="">the said bond had already been dissolved</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>upon motion by <span style="">the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>;"
and (4) The peti­tioner, if </span>"suing beyond the bond .... failed <span style="">to show, or there is </span>no showing that
the respondent <span style="">Socorro," in filing
his petition for </span><i>certiorari</i> and securing the issuance <span style="">of the writ of preliminary in­</span>junction,
"was motivated by <span style="">malice or </span>bad
faith."</p>

<p class="BODY">The present case raises the question of whether <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> claim for damages on account of the improvident
issuance by the respondent appellate court of the writ of <span style="">preliminary injunction </span>should be
dismissed on the ground that he has failed to show or prove bad faith and
malice on the part of the respondent Socorro in obtaining the issuance of <span style="">the writ of preliminary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span><u> vs. <span class="GramE">The</span> Commission
on Elections</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court </span>made an extensive
discussion <span style="">of the principals applicable
to the </span>recovery of damages caused <span style="">through the improvident issuance </span>of a writ of preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">Court said that "damages sustained </span>as a result of <span style="">a </span><span style="">wrongfully obtained injunction may be </span>recovered upon the
injunction bond required to be filed with the court."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same provisions permitting the issuance
of the writ of preliminary injunction require the filing of <span style="">a bond</span><span style=""> </span>before the grant of the writ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The statutory undertaking of the bond is that it shall answer for
all damages which the party <span style="">to be
restrained </span>may sustain <span style="">by </span>reason
of the injunction if the court should finally decide that the plaintiff was not
entitled thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Malice or lack </span>of good faith is not an
element of recovery on the <span style="">bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must </span>be so, because to require
malice as <span style="">a prerequisite would make </span>the
filing of the bond a useless formality."</p>

<p class="BODY">Continuing, this Court said that "the dissolution of the in­junction,
even if the injunction was obtained in good faith, amounts to a determination
that the injunction was wrongfully obtained and a right of action on the
injunction bond immediately accrues."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, for the purpose of recovery upon the injunction bond, "the
dissolution of the injunction because of the failure of petitioner's main cause
of action" provides <span style="">the
"actionable wrong" </span>for the purpose of recovery upon the bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court also stressed, in the<span style=""> </span>same case, that "there is nothing in the Rules of Court
which allows recovery of damages other than upon the bond pledged by the party <span style="">suing for </span>an injunc­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 9, Rule 58, <span style="">limits recovery only upon </span>the bond, and it specifically states
that ... 'the amount of damages to be award­ed to the plaintiff, or to the
defendant, as the case may be, upon the bond of the other party, <span style="">shall </span>be claimed<span style="">, ascertained, </span><span style="">and </span>awarded under the same procedure
as prescribed in Section <span style="">20 of </span>Rule 57.'<span style="">" </span>Under
<span style="">this provision, the party restrained,
if he can </span>recover anything, can recover <span style="">only by reason of and upon the </span>bond - the only security and
protection conceded to<span style=""> </span><span style="">him </span><span style="">by the </span>rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the rule limits the<span style=""> </span>amount of recovery in <span style="">a </span>suit on
an injunction bond <span style="">to the sum thus
fixed, the amount mea­</span>suring the extent of the assumed <span style="">liability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court also finds it necessary to restate the rule in <u>Molina
vs. <span class="SpellE">Somes</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that "an action for damages for the improper suing out of an injunction <span style="">must </span>be maintained upon the same prin­ciples
which govern an action for <span style="">the </span>wrongful
bringing of an action."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule,
however, applies only when the party restrained pursues his claim for damages <span style="">not upon the
injunction </span>bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case
where the party restrained sues not on the injunction bond, the rules accord
him no relief by way of a claim for damages unless he can establish that the
party applicant secured the issuance of the writ maliciously and <span style="">without probable </span>cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court stated that "... when the
process has been sued out maliciously there may be a right of action in favor
of the <span style="">defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>But this right depends upon the law
governing<span style=""> </span>malicious
prosecutions, and has no relation to the claim for damages urged by<span style=""> </span>the defendant in this case. ...

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Additionally, this </span><span style="">Court, </span><span style="">citing <u>P</u></span><u><span style="">almer vs. Foley</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">(71 </span><span style="">N. Y. 106, </span><span style="">108), said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It seems that, without some security given before the
granting of an <span style="">injunction order, </span>or without some order of the court<span style=""> </span>or <span style="">a </span><span style="">judge, </span><span style="">requiring </span><span style="">some </span>act on
the part of the plaintiff, which is equivalent to the giving of security - <span style="">s</span><span style="">u</span>ch
as a deposit of money in court - the defendant has no remedy for any damages
which he may sustain from the issuing of the injunction, <span style="">unless the conduct of the </span>plaintiff
has been such as <span style="">to give ground for an
action for </span>ma­<span style="">licious prosecution."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
</span>the case <span style="">at bar, the </span><span style="">r</span><span style="">ecord
reveals that <span style="">the petitioner <span class="SpellE">A<span style="">quino</span></span></span>,
</span>in the proceedings before the respondent appellate court, filed a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> in the amount of P2<span class="GramE"><span style="">,</span><span style="">0</span>00</span>
and opposed the injunction bond filed by the respondent Socorro on the ground
of its<span style="">&nbsp; </span>insufficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In effect, these brought about the immediate
dissolution of </span>the writ of <span style="">preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> p</span>ursue<span style="">s</span> his claim for damages in the amount
of P19<span style="">9</span><span class="GramE"><span style="">,000</span></span>
no longer <span style="">upon
the injunction </span>bond in th<span style="">e</span>
amount <span style="">of P1,000 </span>filed by <span style="">Socorro</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">with the </span>respondent
<span style="">a</span>ppellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the <span style="">case, </span>applicable here is <span style="">the
holding in <u>Molina vs. <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>,</u><i> </i><u>supra,</u></span><span style=""> that an application for damages on account
of the improvement <span style="">issuance </span></span><span style="">of a </span><span style="">preliminary injunction writ must be governed
by the same principles</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">applicable to an action
for the wrongful bringing</span><span style=""> of an </span>action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the respondent's liability can attach,
it must ap­pear that he filed his petition for <i>certiorari</i> re the main
action and obtained the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction
maliciously and without probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These two essential re­quisites, malicious<span style=""> prosecution</span> and lack of probable cause, are neither alleged <span style="">nor proved </span>in this case before
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record tends to <span style="">establish </span>the liability of the
respondent Socorro.</p>

Respondent Socorro alleges on page five of his brief that the filing by the <span style="">petitioner </span>of <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> brought about the

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first thing I would like to clarify because it is not touched
in the main opinion is that were it not for the fact that petitioner has
erroneously <span style="">assumed
</span>that respondent's injunction bond had been validly cancelled, apparently
without any objection or protest on his part, and, on the basis of such erroneous
assumption, he filed his application for damages without regard to said bond, I
<span style="">would have
voted to reverse the appealed resolution in order to allow petitioner </span>to
recover on the said injunction bond to the full extent thereof, its
cancellation, if true, having <span style="">been </span>improperly made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, <span style="">I </span>consider
it necessary to emphasize that the appealed main resolution of the Court of Appeals
made reference to the "want of bad faith and malice on the part of
petitioner (herein respondent) in filing <u>the instant</u> (in that court) <u><span style="">petition</span></u><span style="">". </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In other words,
the want of bad faith or malice contemplated by the appellate court is not with
reference to the seeking or securing of the injunction itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stress this point because, indeed, the
records <span style="">fail
</span>to show any specific finding of the appellate court that the injunction
in question had been improvidently issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am not ready to hold that the mere dismissal of an action wherein a
preliminary injunction has been is­sued at the instance of plaintiff or the
mere rendition of a judgment favorable to defendant in such an action
constitutes in <span class="GramE">itself</span> <span style="">an implied </span>finding that the plaintiff
was not entitled to the injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provision in Section <span style="">20 </span>of Rule
57 on Attachment to the effect that "if the judgment on the action be in
favor of the party against whom attachment was issued, he <span style="">may recover, upon
the bond given or deposit </span>made by the attaching creditor, any damages
resulting from the <span style="">attachment" may not necessarily apply to injunc</span>tions, since
it <span style="">is </span>conceivable
<span style="">that the </span>propriety
or impropriety of an injunction may not depend on the tenability or lack of it
of plaintiff's alleged cause of action as in the case of attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms of Section 3 of Rule <span style="">58, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">"SEC.
3.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">Grounds for issuance
of preliminary injunction.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A
preliminary injunction may be granted at any time after the commencement of the
action and before judgment, when it is established:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiff is entitled to the relief
demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the
commission or continuance of the acts complained of, or in the performance of
an act or acts, either for <span style="">a </span>limited
period or perpetually;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the commission or continuance of some act
complained of during the <span style="">litigation or </span><span style="">the nonperformance thereof would probably </span>work injustice to the
plaintiff; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the defendant <span style="">is </span>doing, threatens, or <span style="">is </span><span style="">about </span>to do, or is procuring or <span style="">suffering to be done, some act probably </span><span style="">in violation </span><span style="">of the plaintiff's </span><span style="">rights respecting </span><span style="">the subject of the action, and tending to </span><span style="">render the judgment
ineffect</span><span style="">ual."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">do</span> not
necessarily exclude the possibility of an injunc<span style="">tion being </span><span style="">properly and justly issued, even if the plaintiff ultimately fails to
prove the </span><span style="">cause </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">action alleged in
his complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, an examination of Annex C of the petition reveals that
all that petitioner alleged in his "Claim for Damages <span style="">for Wrongful Injunction" were <span class="GramE">these:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"COMES now respondent <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> C. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aquino</span></span><span style=""> through </span><span style="">counsel and </span><span style="">before this
honorable Court respectfully states:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That
this Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction in the above-entitled <span style="">case </span>subject
to the condition that petitioner shall answer for whatever damages that may be
suffered by respond­ents;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That because of the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction, respondent <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> suffered
damages amounting to P199<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that after due trial, petitioner
be ordered to pay damages to respondent <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> in the
sum of P199<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the face of the <span class="SpellE">undenied</span>
statement of fact in respond­ent's brief to the effect that upon the
dissolution of the injunction on account of petitioner's having filed a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> of P2,000.00 "Socorro (respondent) did not
press on the injunction and had not taken possession and enjoyed the use of
said forest area", I sustain respond­ent's contention that for such a huge
claim of practi­cally one-fifth of a million pesos, petitioner's above-quoted
application does not comply with the requirement of Section 20 of Rule 57 in
relation to Section 9 of <span style="">Rule </span>58
of "setting forth the facts showing his right to damages".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioner has not even
alleged that after the writ of injunction was issue it was actually enforced or
implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot imagine how the
mere issuance of the writ, without more, could have occasioned the huge amount
of damages claimed by <span style="">petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, the main opinion gives me the impres­sion that the
ruling in <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As stated, this present proceed­ing <span style="">is </span>upon a motion for assessment of
damages on the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in
the Rules of Court which allows recovery of damages other than upon the bond
pledged by the party <span style="">suing </span>for an injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sec<span style="">tion 9, Rule 58, limits
recovery only upon the bond, thus:</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'SEC. 9.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><i>Judgment to in­clude damages against par­ty and
sureties</i>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Upon the trial
the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, or to the defendant, as
the case may be, <i>upon the bond</i> of the other party, shall be claimed,
ascertained, and awarded under the same procedure as prescribed in Section 20
of Rule 57.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Italics supplied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 20, Rule 57, has been here quoted
earlier.)</p>

<blockquote>It would be misreading the rule to allow
damages beyond the amount of the bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bond, under this rule, is the only protection con­ceded to the party
restrained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­covery cannot be made
beyond what the law permits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This principle is skillfully ex­plained in Molina vs. <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>, supra, at pp. 64-65, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The assertion by some text writers and courts that the one who
sues out an in­junction without legal cause is liable on the theory that he
wrongfully induced or moved the court to take the action which it did, <span style="">is, </span>in <span style="">our judgment, without stable foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">He</span> who obtains</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a
thing by permission of the law, and by strict com­pliance with the law, </span>ought
not to be held liable in any manner except that specified in the law under
which he operates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ought not to be
held for a trespass or other wrong, as they assert he may be in <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
can it be logically said that one who, acting in good faith, obtains an injunc­tion
or property under <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">replevin</span> in precisely the manner
required by law has <span style="">committed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">legal wrong against the person as to whom the
law authorizes him to obtain the injunc­tion?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law itself, by virtue of the conditions which it imposes, fully
protects the defendant against the evil effects of the injunction; and if the
party securing the injunc­tion has performed all that the law requires of him
as a condition prece­dent to obtaining it, what more can be asked?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In re­turn for the restrictions of the
injunction, the de­fendant has been given cer­tain legal rights against the
plaintiff by way of an undertaking which, by vir­tue of the law itself, ful­ly
compensates him for the change of position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bond is full compensation for the privileges which the plaintiff
receives and for those which the defend­ant loses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law says so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute asserts that the doing of certain
things by the plaintiff shall be a complete compensation to the defendant for
that which the law requires him to give up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it is not complete compensation, then the law is unjust, in that it
requires the defendant to give up something for which he receives no
compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be presumed
or believed that the legislature intend­ed to do such a thing, and it is not to
be presumed or believed that it did do it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, even, if the law be unjust, an injustice of the law cannot be cured
by an injustice to a party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The giving
of the undertaking legally equalizes the sta­tus of the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To put upon the plaintiff the addi­tional burden
of a trespass or other wrong would destroy the legal equilibrium and produce an
injustice.'</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Recovery of private respondent must therefore be limited to
the amount of the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the bond
is insuffi­cient in amount, the law expressly gives the party affected the
recourse of <span class="GramE">ex<span style="">cepting</span></span><span style=""> thereto and provides for the dissolution of
the injunction if 'a bond sufficient in amount with suffi­cient sureties
approved after justifi­cation is not filed forthwith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec­tion 8, Rule 58, Rules of Court.)"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">which to me means that a defendant in
injunction has no remedy for the recovery of damages arising from the un­warranted
or unjustified issuance of the injunction other than upon the bond, is
qualified by <span class="SpellE">Somes</span> in that independently of the bond
or when the amount of damages <span style="">claimed is </span><span style="">in excess of the amount of the bond, the en­joined party may sue for
damages upon a showing of ma­licious prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not sure that such is the true import of
<span class="SpellE">Somes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I
</span><span style="">may </span><span style="">admit that some of the decisions cited or
quoted in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Somes</span></span><span style=""> do </span><span style="">give hints of such a possibility, I do not see that the statutory
background of the injunction bonds in those cases is the same <span style="">as </span>ours in this jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the following passage in <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>,
added to that quoted by Justice Sanchez in <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, is
to me clear enough in indicating that when a bond is required by law, it is the
exclusive recourse to <span style="">which </span>an
injunc­tion defendant is entitled:</p>

<blockquote>"The assertion of text writers that the party in cases of <span class="SpellE">reple­vin</span> or injunction, wrongfully put the court in
operation, and that, therefore, he is liable as in tort or otherwise apart from
his bond to the defendant therefore, is, in our judgment, also unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a theory is bad not only for the reasons
already given but also for the further reason that it <span style="">makes </span>the plaintiff an insurer of the judgment of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, upon that theory,
the plain­tiff, before he can safely obtain an injunction or a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>, must be certain that the court will de­cide in
his favor; that is, the plaintiff must insure a judgment of the court in his
favor, on the pain of being sued in tort or other legal wrong, in addition to
his liability resulting from the responsibility of his sureties on the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a theory nulli­fies the symmetry of the
law and destroys the equality between the parties which the law
establishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have said, the
statute as­serts conclusively that the giv­ing of a bond to the defendant is an
exact equivalent fore the loss <span style="">which he
sustains by reason of his change of position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the plaintiff has paid </span><span style="">the defendant in full for what­ever benefits
he has obtained from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, now, we
add to </span><span style="">that payment the
obligation to respond to a defense in damage for the commission of a tort or
other wrong, we at once destroy that equality </span><span style="">which the law has </span><span style="">established, and lay a burden upon the
plaintiff which, in equity, he ought not to bear and which, </span><span style="">under </span><span style="">the law, he is not required to bear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law </span><span style="">expressly </span><span style="">states </span><span style="">what shall </span><span style="">be his
punishment if he is wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts cannot
by their own fiat add anything more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
injury is caused by operation of the law, not by the act of plain­tiff."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Molina vs. <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>,
24 Phil. 49, 65-66.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">I am more inclined, therefore, to hold
that <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> has re­stricted whatever broad
implications <span class="SpellE">Somes</span> may have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, my view is that under <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> there is no re­medy other than upon the bond, whether
the injunction is maliciously or otherwise obtained, and that good faith of the
enjoiner is never a defense <span style="">in a claim
for damages </span>caused by the unwarranted or unjustified issuance of the
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If additional authority of
similar weight to those relied upon in <span class="SpellE">Somes</span> is
needed to support this view, I find that in Gorton v. Brown, 27 Ill. 489, 81
Am. Dec. 245, wherein it appeared that <span style="">a
</span>bond had been given upon <span style="">obtaining
an </span>injunction, the bond being required by sta­tute, it was held that the
remedy of the defendant in in­junction proceedings was exclusively upon the
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We hold the remedy on the bond given on
ob­taining the injunction is <span style="">all the </span>remedy
to which the in­<span style="">jured party can </span>resort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is designed by the statute, to cover all
damages the party enjoined can possibly sus­tain, <span style="">and it is </span>in the power of the judge or officer granting the writ
to require a bond in a penalty suffi­<span style="">cient
to cover </span>all conceivable damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This bond is a high security which the law requites the complainant in <span style="">a bill for an injunction to </span>execute,
to indemnify the de­fendant, in case the <span style="">injunction
shall be dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a familiar
principle, when a party has taken a higher </span>security, his suit must be
brought on that <span style="">security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bond becomes, </span>when forfeited, the
cause of action, and is <span style="">intended </span>by
<span style="">the law, to measure the</span> <span style="">damages of every kind which the party may
sustain by wrongfully suing out the </span>injunction in case it is
dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is not at all like the official bonds of
sheriffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are made payable to the
People of the State, not to any particular person, and consequently do not
merge a remedy one may have outside of the bond, and besides, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the policy of the law to multiply the remedies against public
officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not so with the injunction
bond; that is made payable to the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is the only person interested in it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is his security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">all the law gives him as his security, and he is bound to sue on the
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were no bond given or re­quired,
then the action might lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action
on the case, under the circumstances shown, cannot and ought not to be
maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is against public
policy." (150 ALR 907-908.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">This case looks to me nearer to our statutory back­ground
than any of those cited in <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, I do not feel it is necessary for me to make a
definite commitment on this point in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first three reasons I have given above, are more than enough to
justify the denial of the present petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Withal, although it appears that in its ori­ginal appealed resolution of
denial the Court of Ap­peals did mention "want of bad faith or
malice", it is not clear to me that after the petitioner filed his mo­tion
for reconsideration, the appellate court was still of the same view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that respondent filed with
the said appellate court the following oppo­sition or answer to petitioner's
motion for reconsider­ation, which motion pointed out that the rules do not
require any showing of the malice or bad faith referred to by the Court of
Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"Comes now petitioner above, and per order of this Court,
dated Octo­ber 2, 1964, in answer to the motion for reconsideration to the
denial of the original motion of respondents demanding damages for wrongful in­junction,
respectfully submit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the decision of this Honorable Court
under date of June 29, 1964, having been appealed for review with the Supreme
Court under case No. L-23605 and the petition for the issuance of a writ of
Certiorari, still pending with said Superior Court, it is deemed that said
motion on the part of respondents is still premature and should be addressed to
the latter as it was held in said decision that this Court lacked jurisdic­tion
over the petition as above-entitled; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the matter of the de­termination whether
there was any wrongful attachment or not is still to be resolved in what final
decision may be made on the case of Certiorari and Mandamus, and therefore, any
issues incidental to the question of the issuance of a preliminary injunction,
should be resolved in a court with proper jurisdiction and not with this Court,
as it was held that it had no jurisdiction over the <span style="">main </span>action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is prayed that the motion
for reconsideration be denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">and</span></span><span style=""> the </span>appellate court simply resolved
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Upon consideration of the mo­tion filed by
counsel for the respondents in case CA-G.</span> <span style="">R. No. 33560-R, Francisco Socorro vs. Hon. Montano A. Ortiz, etc., et
al., praying that </span><span style="">the </span>resolution
of Aug­ust 17, 1964, be reconsidered on the ground that malice and bad faith or
<span style="">motive are not factors in </span>the
determination of whether or not a party litigant <span style="">is liable for damages for the wrongful issuance </span>of a writ of <span style="">preliminary injunc­</span>tion, and that <span style="">as </span><span style="">long as the is­</span>suance
of the writ caused damages <span style="">to </span>the
adverse party he <span style="">is enti­</span>tled to
<span style="">a </span>judgment for <span style="">damages; </span>and of <span style="">the answer thereto of coun</span><span style="">sel for petitioner;
the Court RESOLVED to DENY the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let the resolution of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="8"><span style="">August 17, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, denying
respondent <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span>
claim for damages, STAND."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, I am not convinced that the grounds of
the action taken by the Court of Appeals being assailed in the present case
before Us is clear enough for Us to make a categorical ruling on the point
under discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I prefer to reserve my
final opinion on it until a more appropriate case comes to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, if <span style="">the </span>ruling
in the main opinion that an action for malicious prosecution lies independently
of the claim on the injunction bond is meant to prevail, I believe it is but
fair to petitioner to hold also as a corollary to said ruling that the
procedural requirements and limitations of Section 9 of Rule 58, which contem­plates
exclusively claims upon the injunction bond, do not apply to such action for <span style="">malicious prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In con­sequence, the Court of Appeals
is not the proper court where petitioner's claim should have been filed and,
therefore, petitioner is still free to <span style="">pursue
such </span>claim elsewhere.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before closing, I notice that the main opinion holds towards the
end thus:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> This
being the case, applicable here is the holding in <u>Molina vs. <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>,</u> <u>supra</u>, that an application for damages on
<span style="">account </span>of the improvident
issuance of a preliminary injunction writ must be governed by the same
principles applicable to an action for the wrongful bringing of an action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the respondent's liability can attach,
it must appear that he filed his petition for certiorari re the main action and
obtain­ed the issuance of the writ of preliminary <span style="">injunction malicious­ly and </span>without probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two essential requisites, malicious
prosecution and lack of probable cause, are neither alleged nor proved in this
case before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the re­cord
tends to establish the liability of the respondent Socorro.<span style="">"</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Does this mean that in the action for malicious prosecution to
recover damages arising from an unwar­ranted injunction, the damaged party has
to show ma­lice or bad faith in both the filing of the action and the securing
of the injunction, otherwise, he cannot recover?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the affirmative, <span style="">is the resolution </span>of the Court of Appeals which <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> are refusing to review, </span>cor­rect in requiring the showing of <span style="">malice or bad faith </span>in the main claim,
without also referring to the ma­lice or bad faith in the securing of the
injunction?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>
require malice or <span style="">bad faith in filing
the main action in </span>order that there may <span style="">be a recovery </span>for malicious obtaining of <span style="">an injunction in connection with such main </span>action?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What, <span style="">indeed,
is the basis of the possible </span>award of damages, the malicious prosecution
of the suit, the malicious securing of <span style="">the
injunction, </span>or both?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>, Justice Moreland quotes from <span class="SpellE">Rus­sel</span>
vs. Farley, 105 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
433, 438, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"And if the legal right <span style="">is doubt­</span>ful, either in point of law or of fact, the court is
always reluctant to take a course which <span style="">may
result in material injury to either party, </span>for the damage arising from
the act of the court <span style="">itself is a <span class="SpellE"><u>damnum</u></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>absque</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>injuria</u></span>, for which there <span style="">is </span>no redress except a <span style="">decree for the </span>costs of the <span style="">suit, or in </span>a <span style="">particu­</span>lar (proper) case, an action for malicious
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To remedy this defect
(difficulty), the court, in the exercise of its discretion, frequently resorts
to the expedient of imposing terms and conditions upon the party at <span style="">whose instance </span>it proposes to
act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Is it clear from this that the action
that can be filed independently of the bond is one for malicious prosecu­tion
of the main action or merely for malicious suing <span style="">out of the injunction?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frankly, I
cannot answer these questions in </span>the light of the main opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">These considerations <span style="">have
compelled me to write this </span>separate concurring opinion.</p>
