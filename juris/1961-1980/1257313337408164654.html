				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><h3></h3><p>Petition for review by certiorari of the decision of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations.</p>
<p>The facts are: Sometime in March 1958 tenants Juanito Tugba and Abraham Rubi 
filed in the Court of Agrarian Relations against landholder Jose B. Yusay 
separate petitions seeking reliquidation of their respective palay produce for 
the agricultural years 1952-53 to 1956-57, inclusive (Annexes A and B). It was 
specifically alleged that they did not receive their entire share of the produce 
for each cf those years and therefore prayed that Yusay be ordered to pay the 
difference. In his answers (Annexes C and D) to the petitions, Yusay put up the 
affirmative defense, among others, that Tugba and Rubi's causes of action had 
prescribed. Upon agreement of the parties, the two cases were heard jointly. On 
October 24, 1959 the court promulgated a single decision which, after finding 
that Yusay had "short-shared" his two tenants by 10% of the produce for the 
years 1952-53 to 1956-57, ordered him to pay them the corresponding undelivered 
portions, and dismissed Rubi and Tugba's claims for recovery of alleged 
overpayments of loans as well as Yusay's counterclaim for damages and attorney's 
fees. The decision did not touch upon the issue oi prescription.</p>
<p>In his motion for reconsideration of the decision (Annex F), Yusay called the 
attention of the court to the affirmative defense of prescription. The court 
denied the motion on.the ground that prescription did not lie because the right 
of action to demand a written accounting is different from reliquidation of 
harvests or crops.</p>
<p>Yusay filed the present petition for review, raising as sole issue whether or 
not the cause of action of respondents Tugba and Rubi had prescribed. 
Essentially, the issue is whether or not an action to demand a written 
accounting is the same as an action for reliquidation.</p>
<p>Petitioner claims that they are one and the same, and and relying on the 
provisions of Section 17, Republic Act No. 1199, which states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the absence of a written accounting in accordance with the preceding 
paragraph, the tenant may, within three years from the date of the threshing of 
the crop in question, petition the Court to compel the landholder to render an 
accounting of the same in accordance with this section,"</p></blockquote>
<p>argues that respondents' cause of action in so far as the agricultural years 
1952-53 to 1954-55 are concerned had already prescribed. If an action for 
reliquidation is equivalent to a suit for accounting under the aforequoted 
provision of law, then the plea of prescription is in order.</p>
<p>However, this Court, in a recent decision, has defined the difference between 
reliquidation and accounting thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="style2">"This provision (Section 17, R.A. 1199) refers, however, to the 
right to demand a written <i>accounting</i>, which—petitioners maintain—is 
different from a <i>reliquidation</i>. Indeed, an accounting between a landowner 
and an agricultural tenant is a <i>statement </i>made by the former of the 
contributions made by both, the expenses incurred, the amount harvested, the 
sharing system followed by the parties and the share actually received by each. 
Upon the other hand, a reliquidation involves the determination, based either 
upon the accounting made by the landholder, or upon the facts and determined bv 
the court, of the share to which each party is entitled. The period within which 
an accounting may be demanded is limited to three (3) years, for the lawmaker 
evidently deems it unreasonable to expect or require the landholder to remember 
distinctly or keep a complete record of the pertinent items for a longer period 
of time. When such items are not disputed, and the only issue refers to the 
proportion in which the net produce shall be divided—and such is the situation 
obtaining in tho case at bar—the reason for the rule disappears." (Benson, et 
al., <i>vs.</i> Ocampo, L-18189, December 29, 1962). </p></blockquote>
<p class="style2">The Agricultural Tenancy Act (Republic Act No. 1199) provides a 
prescriptive period for accounting suite only but makes no mention of the period 
within which an action for reliquidation may be brought. Consequently, we have 
to rely on the Civil Code provisions on prescription. If not appearing that 
there was a written contract between the parties, respondents' actions prescribe 
within six years (Article 1145 (1), new civil code). Respondents, therefore, 
instituted their respective suits well within the period.</p>
<p class="style2">The decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
petitioner.</p>
