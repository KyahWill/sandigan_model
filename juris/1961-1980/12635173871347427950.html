concerning the employer's power of dismissal and the corresponding right of the
employee not to be dismissed without just cause during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>,
of his contract of employment for a fixed period.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal had its roots in a rather trifling incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="11" month="1">11 January 1956</st1:date> the teaching force of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place> was convened by the school
principal to select the muse of the sophomore class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the meeting, a disagreement in the
choice of the muse arose between present appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> and his co-teacher Catalina <span style="">Luna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
found by the Court of Appeals, the following remarks were exchanged (C. A.
decision, peti­<span style="">tion, Annex "C", </span>pages 3-4, Record, pages 21-22):</p>

<blockquote>"'<span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, that cannot be, Miss Luna, I have chosen
Miss Sophomore, Miss Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Pavillon</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luna:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>, the principal gave me the
authority for having Miss <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span> Miss Sophomore.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> (in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miss Luna,

as <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place> (Miss Luna, I should be the
one to be obeyed here because I am an old teacher in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luna (also in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>):<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Yabang</span> <span class="SpellE">naman</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> (You are boastful, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>

<span class="SpellE">ko</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It is
true I am boastful, but I make good my boasts).'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Feeling insulted by the word "<span class="SpellE">yabang</span>",
<span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> absented himself from his classes for the
next two days and went to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> to
consult a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of <st1:date year="1956" day="13" month="1">13
 January 1956</st1:date>, Luna, accompanied by two other teachers, went to <span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span> house to apologize and settle the case
amicably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was, however, advised by <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> to arrange the matter with his lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the case was not settled because on <st1:date year="1956" day="17" month="1">17 January 1956</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>
filed a criminal complaint for serious oral defamation against Luna in the
Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, or on <st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="1">18
 January 1956</st1:date>, the Board of Trustees of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>
hastily convoked a special meeting to probe the <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>-Luna
tiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the investigation, the board
passed a reso­lution finding <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> guilty of the
following charges, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For grave misconduct as teacher in the Academy
for having deliberately disregarded the Board of Trustees and immediately
brought their case before the Court of the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span>, with­out first giving the Board of Trustees a
chance to in­vestigate their case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For violation of civil service rules for
absent­ing from his teaching on January 12 and 13, 1956, with­out permission
from the Principal of the Academy, and went to Manila for his personal
interests in order to look for a lawyer to handle his case against Miss Luna;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For violation of the professional ethics of
the teaching profession;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For refusing to amicably settle his case with
Miss Luna unless he be paid with P500.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for other cases of inefficiency in
school."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and suspended him from his teaching
position in the academy from <st1:date year="1956" day="19" month="1">19
 January 1956</st1:date> up to the end of the school year, without pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board denied <span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span>
subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="5" month="3">5 March 1957</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> lodged with the Bureau of Private Schools an
administrative complaint against the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the director of the bureau
handed down his decision clearing <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> of all the
above-enumerated charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
suspension having been consequently declared unjustified, the academy was
directed to pay the complainant teacher's salary for the period covered by said
suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision was affirmed on
appeal by the Secretary of Education.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place> thereafter elevated the
case to the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="2">18 February 1957</st1:date>,
another case, a civil case for damages that was to become the immediate
precursor of the instant appeal, <span style="">was
initiated </span>by <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
This was decided on <st1:date year="1957" day="26" month="9">26 September 1957</st1:date>
again in favor of <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> <span style="">who</span> <span style="">was </span>found by
the trial court innocent of each and every culpable act or conduct imputed
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His suspension was thus
adjudged also as one without just cause, in violation of the terms of <span style="">his contract of </span>employment with the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the contract, <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> bound himself, for P150-a-month salary, to teach <span style="">in the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pag</span>bilao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place> for the school year
1955-1956, during which period the academy bound itself, in turn, not to
dismiss or suspend him, subject to a certain condition, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"(T)he services of the above-mentioned instructor (<span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>) will not be terminated or suspended during the
term of the contract (<st1:date year="1955" day="1" month="6">1 June 1955</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1956" day="31" month="3">31 March 1956</st1:date>) without
notifying the Director of Private Schools."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The suspension was, as previously
intimated, effected in the middle of the school year, and the report or notice
thereof was filed with the Bureau of Private Schools only after the receipt by
the academy of a copy of the complaint in the administrative case instituted by
<span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> against it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of the foregoing, the trial court ordered the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to pay <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> P360.00,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
representing his salary for the period starting 19 January to <st1:date year="1956" day="31" month="3">31 March 1956</st1:date>; P900.00 as
compensatory damages; P1,500.00 as moral damages; P1,000.00 as attorney's fees
and expenses of litigation; and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the criminal case against Luna was remanded to the
same Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which court, after trial, rendered a judgment of conviction for slight oral
defamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luna appealed to the Court
of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and won an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appel­late
court held that, considered in the context it was uttered, the word "<span class="SpellE">yabang</span>" (boastful or arrogant) was not defamatory and
did not lower other's estimation of the person of <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>
nor cast <span class="SpellE">approbrium</span> on his character or
reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then towards the end of the
decision, the court dropped a remark to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span>
"subsequent recourse to the law (court) on oral defamation" was
"not justified at all".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="16" month="10">16 October 1957</st1:date>,
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place> filed with the trial court a
motion for new trial of the civil case <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> vs. <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>
which had earlier been adversely decided against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground was newly discovered evidence
consisting of the above decision in People vs. Luna rendered on <st1:date year="1957" day="30" month="8">30 August 1957</st1:date> by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span>
Academy advanced the view that since the filing of the criminal case against
Luna was "the main cause of (<span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span>)
suspension" the trial court could not have held that <span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span>
suspension was unjustified, and the corresponding award to him proper, had the
appellate court's decision in the criminal case in question been duly
considered <span style="">in </span>the disposition of
the civil case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for new trial
was, however, denied on the ground that the decision of the Court of Appeals in
the criminal case did not constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> in the later civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place> duly appealed to the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After lengthily quoting that
portion of the decision in People vs. Luna discussing the non-defamatory nature
of the word "<span class="SpellE">yabang</span>" and ending with a
one-sentence comment that <span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span> subsequent
recourse to the court was unwarranted, the Court of Appeals concluded that the
actuations of <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> in accusing Luna of a crime in
court although he "knew beforehand that he had no <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
case," in refusing "to consider all overtures for amicable settlement
. . . . in his vindictive determination to embarrass not only Miss Luna but
also the <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span> Academy", and in maligning the
Board of Trustees by uttering such expression as "Board of Trustees, <span class="SpellE">puwit</span> <span class="SpellE">nila</span>" (Board of
Trustees, their * * * *), upon being reminded by one of his co-teachers who
went to his house in the evening of 13 January 1956 that he should have first
reported to the board before "consulting lawyer, rendered him "no
longer . . . . a desirable member of the teaching staff of the <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span> Academy who (could) measure up to the moral
responsibility of his calling to set by <span class="SpellE">exemple</span> and
precept the proper norms of conduct to be emulated by the students of the
school;" that "(h)is continued presence (therein) would have been
prejudicial to the welfare and discipline and good name of the school;"
and that "the suspension was, therefore, in the best interest of
defendant-appellant (<span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span> Academy) to avoid the
evil consequences of probable factional strife and tension among the teachers
and students".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court further
ruled that implied in the academy's right of appointment as an employer was its
power of dismissal or suspension of its employees, which power was, under the
circumstances surrounding the present case, properly exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision, <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>
resorted to this Tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find ourselves unable to concur in the views of the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>
was no lawyer, and could not have known "before­hand that he had no <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> case".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span>
and the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> found that
he had been slandered by his co-teacher, and although the latter <span style="">was </span>ultimately acquitted by a superior
court, the events previously narrated support <span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span>
good faith (which must also be presumed) in making the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it can not be said that his
"recourse to the <span style="">law is </span>not
justified at all".</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that the regulations of the Academy required <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> to first refer his case to the Trustees of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Academy</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incident with Miss Luna was a personal
matter, and anyway, the Trustees were not competent to determine whether the
felony of oral defamation had been committed or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly remarked by the trial court,
"by entering into a contract of service with the school" <span class="SpellE">Jami­lano</span> "did not surrender his right to seek justice
from the courts when occasion so demands".</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is characterized by the Court of Appeals as vindictive
because of his refusal to settle the case amicably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the con­clusion unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His refusal was not absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision appealed from (page 4) quotes <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> as saying "it is for you to drop at my
attorney's office and arrange the case with him", which is reasonable;
petitioner had contracted for legal services before he was approached and could
not expect that his counsel would waive compensation if he decided to drop the
charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as to the remark made by petitioner to his co-teacher (<span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Orito</span>), in answer to the
plea that <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span> should have first reported the
incident to the Academy Trustees - "board of trustees, <span class="SpellE">puwit</span>
<span class="SpellE">nila</span>" - the anatomical expletive does not appear
to have been made with deliberate intent to denigrate the Trustees, but as an
expression, in the heat of pique or chagrin, of a belief that the affair was
not within the jurisdiction of the trustees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The public officials charged with the duty of supervising the <span style="">school have </span>found, after hearing, that
<span class="SpellE">Jamilano's</span> conduct did not warrant the suspension
decreed by the Academy authorities, and with that conclusion this Court
concurs, having due regard to the surrounding circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to recall here <span style="">that </span>the <span style="">employer's discretion to select </span>and discipline <span style="">his employees, retaining </span>the best and
weeding out the undesirable, is not absolute but must remain subject to such
reasonable regulation as the police power of the State may impose, pursuant to
the Constitutional prescription to afford protection to labor and promote
social justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One employed without
definite term can not be dismissed without just cause (R. A. 1787); one
employed for a specified period should enjoy no less protection.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering, however, that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Jamilano</span>
is not altogether blameless, since he was not justified in abandoning his
classes and students for <span style="">two days </span>without
notice or provision for his replacement, thereby recklessly disregarding the
supreme interest of the students (and, incidentally, those of the school) and
subordinating them to his private resentment, and that he brought this action
without giving respondent Academy opportunity to comply with the exe­cutive
directives for his reinstatement, this Court is of the opinion that the
petitioner is not entitled to recover damages beyond the compensation due him
for the period of his suspension, plus a reasonable amount for attorney's fees
and expenses of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is set
aside, and that of the Court of First Instance reaffirmed with the modification
that petitioner <span class="SpellE">jamilano</span> recover from respondent <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span> Academy damages in the sum of P<span style="">3</span>60.00 plus legal interest from the
filing of the complaint, and a further P1,000.00 as counsel fees and <span class="SpellE">litis</span> expenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Costs against respondent.</p>
