<blockquote>&quot;It would seem, therefore, that, according to law, the

of <span class=SpellE>Cavite</span> has fully acquiesced to this interpretation

the present action was pending, in view of the reinstatement of <span

that the power to appoint officers and employees of the <span class=SpellE>Cavite</span>

<span class=SpellE>Osmeña</span> Waterworks System, 'the Director of Public
Works of the Philippines shall have exclusive charge and control of all work to
be done and improvements to be made' under the said Act, and in view of the
similarity in the provision of the charters of the cities of <span
class=SpellE>Cavite</span> and <span class=SpellE>Cebu</span> regarding their
Engineering Departments, We see no reason to deviate from the ruling laid down
in the <span class=SpellE>Cavite</span> Waterworks case, <u><span

the City had recognized and acquiesced to the appointments extended by the
Secretary of Public Works and Communications to such employees who were then
receiving their salaries as authorized in said appointments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;In conclusion, we declare that it is the Secretary of Public
