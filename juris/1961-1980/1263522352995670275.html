				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>A reading, even the most casual, of the administrative complaint
against respondent Judge Vicente <span class=SpellE>Ericta</span> would suffice
to make evident that it came from someone whose acquaintance with legal
concepts is of the slightest, if it could be said that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could justifiably have been dismissed
outright as being merely another manifestation of an offended party venting his
spleen on the unfortunate arbiter for failure to obtain in full measure the
retribution he would exact from someone who had done him wrong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As evidently he was a layman, it did require
a certain degree of temerity to call to task respondent Judge for alleged
deficiency of legal knowledge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of
course, there was the further accusation of partiality.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moreover, as the complaint was endorsed to us
by the Department of Justice and with complainant imputing to respondent Judge
bias in favor of the two accused, this Court deemed it best to require
comment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After all it is a prized ideal,
one always to be approximated even if the imperfections of human nature prevent
its full realization, that everyone who has an interest in a court proceeding
is entitled to the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Respondent <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>Judge, </span>however, instead of merely submitting his comments, chose
to file an answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What he did is
certainly not to be deplored.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
thereby a clearer picture emerged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
conviction becomes even stronger than that there is no basis for the complaint
and that he <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>is entitled to </span>be
fully absolved.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>The specific allegations,
in their totality, to follow the thinking of complainant, would demonstrate a
lack in the fund </span>of legal expertise of respondent Judge as well as a
predilection in favor of the accused indicative of his bias.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be useful though to have first a
recital of the facts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the answer of
respondent Judge, the following appears:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;On November 10, 1971, Assistant Fiscal <span class=SpellE>Melencio</span>
S. <span class=SpellE>Peña</span> of <span class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City
filed an information with the Court of First Instance of <span class=SpellE>Quezon</span>
City accusing two defendants of a crime he designates as 'Robbery Hold-up'. * *
* The case was set for arraignment on <st1:date Year="1971" Day="13" Month="12">December
 13, 1971</st1:date>. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The two (2)
defendants, namely, <span class=SpellE>Remigio</span> <span class=SpellE>Nadonga</span>
y Manahan and Rolando <span class=SpellE>Tupaz</span> y Hernandez were
detention prisoners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both were arraigned
on <st1:date Year="1971" Day="13" Month="12">December 13, 1971</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because they had no counsel, the Court
appointed Atty. <span class=SpellE>Abelardo</span> <span class=SpellE>Andal</span>
as their counsel de-officio.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon their
arraignment, both defendants pleaded guilty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Thereupon, upon motion of Atty. <span class=SpellE>Abelardo</span> <span
class=SpellE>Andal</span>, the defendants were allowed to prove the additional
mitigating circumstance of drunkenness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Defendant <span class=SpellE>Remigio</span> <span class=SpellE>Nadonga</span>
took the witness stand to prove drunkenness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After his testimony the fiscal did not ask for a chance to present
rebuttal evidence and the case was submitted for decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hence, a judgment of conviction was forthwith
rendered and promulgated in open Court after the plea of guilty. * * *.&quot;<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The complainant in this case, <span class=SpellE>Delfin</span> M. Tobias, is
the offended party in the above criminal case.</p>

<p class=BODY>The charges will now be examined one by one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is how respondent Judge refuted the
alleged unusual consideration shown both defendants:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;With respect to the first charge of
leniency, the law allows leniency in the imposition of the penalty to
defendants who plead guilty and who have mitigating circumstances in their
favor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this particular case, the
Court appreciated in favor <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>of the </span>defendants the mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty
and drunkenness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The penalty prescribed
for the offense charged in the information is <span class=SpellE>prision</span>
<span class=SpellE>correccional</span> in its maximum period to <span
class=SpellE>prision</span> mayor in its medium period or a range of four (4)
years, two (2) months and one (1) day to ten (10) years.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In view of the concurrence of two mitigating
circumstances in favor of the defendants without any aggravating circumstances
to offset the same, the defendants were entitled to a penalty one degree lower
than that prescribed by law for the offense in accordance with Article 64,
paragraph 5 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One degree lower is <span class=SpellE>arresto</span> mayor in its
maximum period to <span class=SpellE>prision</span> <span class=SpellE>correccional</span>
in its medium period which ranges from four (4) months and one (1) day to four
(4) years and two (2) months.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under the
law, respondent Judge could have imposed upon the defendants even as low a
penalty as four (4) months and one (1) day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But he did not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He imposed a
penalty of one (1) year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus,
respondent Judge was not exactly very lenient.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even if he was, the penalty imposed was within the range fixed by
law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Complainant claims he has evidence
of recidivism and use of motor vehicle against the defendants.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He should have so informed the fiscal before
the filing of the information in order that it could have been properly
alleged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The information filed alleges
no aggravating circumstance.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
No further attention need be paid to the second charge that respondent Judge
did not notify the offended party as to when the arraignment was set.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Clearly the law does not so require.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nor did respondent Judge incur any failure to
comply with a duty the law imposes on him when he did not send a copy of his
decision to the offended party.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Equally <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>so, </span>there is no merit to the alleged
grievance of the offended party that while the information charges
&quot;Robbery Hold-up&quot;, the decision found the accused guilty of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>robbery merely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As was noted in the answer of respondent
Judge, the appropriate legal terminology would be robbery with violence or
intimidation of persons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
unfortunate that the fiscal who filed the information was guilty of legal
imprecision when he added the term &quot;hold-up&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Much less could there be any basis for the last specified
grievance, the alleged ignorance of respondent Judge when he failed to sentence
the accused <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>to </span>suffer subsidiary <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>imprisonment in case </span>of inability to
pay the indemnity of P4,000.00.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It did
suffice for him in his answer to quote the letter of the then Undersecretary of
Justice, now Solicitor General, <span class=SpellE>Estelito</span> P. Mendoza,
to complainant regarding this point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Thus:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;And insofar as the <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>decision does not require </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>subsidiary imprisonment, this is but in
accordance with Republic Act 5465 approved on April 24, 1965 which amends
Article 39 of the Revised Penal Code by requiring subsidiary imprisonment only
in the event of failure to pay the fine imposed but not in case of failure to
pay reparation of damage caused.'<span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>&quot;</span></span><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'> </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>Nothing can be clearer, therefore, than that
respondent Judge has not in any wise, in this particular case at least,
rendered himself susceptible to the accusation that he did not live up to the
exacting standard of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>One last word.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
appears to be a querulous note in the answer of respondent Judge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was not at all <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>happy </span>about having to answer a complaint that, as he pointed out,
betrayed on its face ignorance of elementary legal doctrines.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such reaction, while understandable is not
justifiable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The constitutional right to
a petition, to enable the citizen to air his grievances,<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
would certainly be emasculated if the response of the governmental body to
which it is addressed is one of indifference.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The fate of the people and the supremacy of the Constitution would
thereby be sorely tested.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is worse,
a safety valve against a violent reaction would be closed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This constitutional guarantee requires then
that complaints against officialdom be seriously attended to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Where meritorious, the remedy could be
supplied.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If found to be devoid of
substance, the party charged is vindicated with the complainant having the
satisfaction of at least having been listened to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is thus fidelity to what the
Constitution ordains.</p>

<p class=BODY>More specifically, if this Court were not to take pains to
inquire seriously into any imputation of misconduct on the part of a lower
court, it exposes itself to criticism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It may be indicted for not living up to its responsibility.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Care is to be taken then lest a failure to
pay attention to any administrative suit against a judge may be characterized
as abdication of a solemn trust.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any
other norm of conduct might result in the diminution of the confidence reposed
in the judiciary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At any rate,
respondent Judge was merely asked to comment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That is a midway step between a curt and summary dismissal of a complaint,
invariably the product of a sincere conviction that one has been wronged, even
if not infrequently, without sufficient basis, and giving it due course by
requiring an answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently unaware
of such a difference, respondent Judge submitted an answer explaining in detail
his actuation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As was noted at the
outset, it was well that he did so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For,
as has been made so clearly evident, what was done by him was fully in accord
with the law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moreover, the least
suspicion that his conduct was impressed with leniency towards the accused
cannot justly be entertained.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His
vindication is thus entire and complete.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Respondent Judge, under the circumstances, should be the last to begrudge
that part of his valuable time had to be devoted to putting things in their
true light for the benefit, not <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>so </span>much
of this Court, but of the complainant and the lay public.</p>
