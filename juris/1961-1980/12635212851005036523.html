<p class="BODY">The questioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolution
RR-899 dated April 29, 1911 recounts how after its hearing and resolving the
referral of the provincial board of canvassers of the returns of the elections
for constitutional con­vention delegates held in November, 1970, as disputed by
the various candidates, the canvassing board on March 18, 1971, pursuant to its
di­rective, proclaimed the first nine winning candidates, namely M. ADIL, A.
VELASCO, D. SINSUAT, S. SAMBULAOAN, L. AMPATUAN, A. BADOY, Jr., M. CAMELLO, S.

petitioner Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span> and candidate A. <span class="SpellE">Bagundang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As per the tentative tabulation of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,

for the same set of ten to eleven candi­dates.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span> complains that
after the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> conducted on January 15, 1971 in
Manila the first and only hearing (which hearing was in connection with <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> alone, and
was incomplete with only two witnesses being able to testify for candidate <span class="SpellE">Bagundang</span>) the <span class="SpellE">Co­melec</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> and
without explanation cancelled, until further no­tice, the continuation of the
hearings it had scheduled for January 27-30, 1971 at <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
City (which were expressly ordered by it to be "<span class="SpellE">intrans­ferable</span>
in character"), to hear the testimonies of the chairmen of the boards Of
inspectors in the above questioned towns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span> further complains
that while the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, as early as the lone hearing
of January 15, 1971 had called for the precinct books of voters and the CE Form
39's in the questioned towns for exami­nation and analysis by its and the <span class="SpellE">NBI's</span> handwriting and fingerprint experts and technicians,
and such voting records are actually in its custody, (to determine whether the
returns are manufactured, should the examina­tion show that the
"voting" was but by a few hands or by fake or fictitious voters,
euphemistically called by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as
"substitute voters”), the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
"unreasonably deviated from the standard procedure it has applied in cases
of similar nature as in the <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> case; <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> case; Cadiz case <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>
case; and <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> case" and did not have such
examination and analysis carried out.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> issued its
questioned resolution of <st1:date year="1971" day="19" month="4">April 19,
 1971</st1:date>, wherein it ordered the dismissals of both the petitions of <span class="SpellE">Bagundang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span> on the
same ground of "failure to establish sufficient grounds for the rejection
of the returns" from the towns respectively questioned by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said resolution has become final as against candidate <span class="SpellE">Bagundang</span> who filed no appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span>, however, timely filed the
present petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his motion, the
Court issued on <st1:date year="1971" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1971</st1:date>
the writ of preliminary injunc­tion restraining the reconvening of the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> provincial canvassing board for the purpose of
completing the canvass and proclaiming the tenth winning candidate for delegate
from the province.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> justified its resolution
dismissing the two petitions, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span class="SpellE">Bagundang's</span> petition, it held that
"<u>in the absence, therefore, of any strong and convincing evidence
appearing on the face of the returns that said returns are manufactured</u> and
the figures therein were just pre­pared according to the fancy of the
inspectors without regard to the contents of the ballot box, the Commission
would not be justified in rejecting the returns as manufactured returns."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Realizing, however, that its present procedure differed from that
followed by it in the <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> and other cases,
where it had not merely relied <u>on the face of the returns</u>, but had
resorted to <u>examination and analysis of the signatures and thumbprints</u>
to arrive at its conclusion that the elections were "sham" and the
returns rejected as "manufactured re­turns", the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
sought to make the following distinction:</p>

<blockquote>"The Commission would like to distinguish the present case and
that of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> where the Commission ruled the
election returns were manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>rationale
of the decision of the Commission in the <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
case is that the election in the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
was sham and tantamount to no election at all since out of 9, 557 who voted in
the 42 precincts, only 239 were found to be those of the registered voters in
said 42 precincts</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding of
illegal voting was more than sufficient to overcome the presumptions of
regularity and justified the rejection of the returns as manufactured returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In the present case, we find no conclusive
evidence to warrant a finding that the election returns should not be accorded
any prima facie value because no elections were actually held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the allegation of
BAGUNDANG that many of his votes were not counted but were read as votes for
other candidates assumes that there was voting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How could he claim that he got at least 3 000 votes in each of the towns
of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> and in
<span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Piang</span> unless more than
three thousand voted in these towns?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the final analysis, <span class="SpellE">BAGUNDANG's</span> thesis is actually
one against the regularity of the counting of the votes, an incident of the
election, and not one of 'no election</u>' like what happened in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a
matter to be ventilated in an election protest."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Resolving <span class="SpellE">Estaniel's</span> petition "as
an incident or dependent upon <span class="SpellE">Bagundang's</span> petition”,
when as justifiably complained of by <span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span>, the
two petitions "are separate and distinct from one another aside from
containing substantially different allegations of facts," the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> dismissed <span class="SpellE">Estaniel's</span>
petition, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>For the same reasons, the Commission finds the pe­tition
of ESTANIEL to be without merit insofar as he ques­tioned the returns from <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, the same
towns included in the petition of BAGUNDANG.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The result of upholding the returns from these two (2) towns would be
that the returns from all the other towns questioned by ESTANIEL would no
longer affect the result of the elections</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The inclusion in the canvass of the returns from <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> would be fatal to the pretension of
ESTANIEL of joining the winning candidates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the Commission notes that the <u>main con­tention
of ESTANIEL</u> is that the returns from <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pagalung­an</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maganoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dinaig</span> were <u>manufactured because of the high percentages
of voting</u> in these towns, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> - 98%; <span class="SpellE">Maganoy</span> - 89. <span class="GramE">03%; <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span> - 83.68%; and <span class="SpellE">Dinaig</span> - 88.6%.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>The returns, however, from said towns cannot be excluded from the
canvass merely on said grounds for the doctrine of manu­factured returns based
on statistical improbability as laid down, in the LAGUMBAY case is that all the
candidates of one party had obtained 100%</u>, either of all the registered
voters or of the votes cast while all the candidates of the other party
received uniformly zero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission
further doubts the application of the LAGUMBAY doctrine in the election for
Constitutional delegates because of the fact that the participation of the
political parties in said elections had been banned and that all candidates are
supposed to be independent candidates running on their own without support from
any political party or civic organization.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nothing has been said as to why, notwithstanding that the peace
and order situation presumably sufficiently improved afterwards, the
continuation of the hearings has not been set and held, in order to give
petitioner his day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither has any valid reason been given by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
for its un­explained act of not implementing and in effect recalling <u>sub <span class="SpellE">rosa</span></u> its own announced action of causing the
examination and analysis of the voting records in the questioned towns and for
abruptly considering the hearings terminated, when petitioner had not yet
begun, much less sub­mitted his case.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
ground for dismissing <span class="SpellE">Bagundang's</span> petition (that <span class="SpellE">Bagundang's</span> "thesis is actually one against the
regularity of the counting of the votes, an incident of the election, and not
one of ‘no elections’) could not validly be invoked and used by it as the same
ground for dis­missing petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estaniel's</span>
petition, insofar as the returns from the two towns of <span class="SpellE"><u>Pikit</u></span><u>
and <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> commonly questioned</u> by the two
complainants were concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner's thesis, as expressly averred in his verified
petition before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, was that "no true
and expressive elections were therein held and if there be any, such were
minimal or disregarded, as in all the towns in question ballots were either
filled up by a few unauthorized hands or the returns accomplished as fancy,
gusto and scheme permitted" - which was but another way of alleging the
existence of "massive substitute voting" held to be anathema by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, since it necessarily signifies that the returns are
"manufactured returns" which should be entirely rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> itself, on the
strength thereof and of its own notice that "there have been anomalies
committed in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> every (time) during
elections", had ordered the holding of hearings to question the chairmen
of the boards of inspectors (as it had done in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sagada</span>, etc.) and to have the signatures and
fingerprints of the voting records examined and analyzed - which, however, it
has failed to implement and carry out up to now.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was concededly the <u>main contention</u> of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span>, and was so duly acted upon by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> until it reversed itself per its questioned
resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unusually high
percentage of voting in the ques­tioned towns was <u>not</u> the main
contention of <span class="SpellE">Estaniel</span>, as now erroneously stated in
the resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly stated in
the present petition, peti­tioner "had invited (<span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>)
attention to these high voting percentages simply as an index to the failure of
election or that substitute voters voted in these towns."</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
principal defense in the present case, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e.
"that the examination of election records for purposes of determining
irregularities in voting procedures is a matter of discretion on the part of
the Commis­sion on Elections depending upon the facts and circumstances of the
case"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
must necessarily fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did in fact exercise its discretion and order the
examination and analysis of the voting records signatures and fingerprints as
well as the questioning of the chairmen of the boards of inspectors, in order
to determine the genuineness or falsity of the elec­tion returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot recall such exercise of discretion
without valid reason and justification.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> case <span class="SpellE">resolve<i>r</i></span>
just now by the Court in <u>Diaz vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>,
L-33378, and likewise involving a delegate seat (from the Mountain Province for
the Constitutional Convention under Republic Act No. 6132, the Court sanctioned
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> procedure, upon establishment of a
strong <u>prima facie</u> case, of causing the examination and analysis of the
signatures and fingerprints of the precinct books of voters and the CE 39's and
voting records, in order to determine whether the reported elections were sham
and tantamount to no election at all and accordingly accord no <u>prima facie</u>
value to the election returns and reject them as manu­factured and false
returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, however, therein emphasized through Mr. Justice Reyes
that “justice and equity imperatively demand that there should be no
discrimination in the application of the rules by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>."</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The abrupt cancellation
of further hearings and the non-implementation of the announced examination and
analysis of the voting records give strong weight to petitioner's submittal
that he has not been afforded his right to due process and a fair and full
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bagundang's</span>
concession in his petition of mere irregularity in the counting of the votes
could not be extended to herein petitioner's own petition complaining of no
elections and manufactured returns - by virtue of the maxim of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> inter <span class="SpellE">alios</span> <span class="SpellE">acta</span> <span class="SpellE">alteri</span> <span class="SpellE">nocere</span>

<p class="BODY">Much as the Court wishes to pronounce finis to this contest,
(which must have been likewise the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
well-meaning but erroneously implemented motivation for its questioned resolution),
it is therefore constrained to remand the case to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
in the interest of the electorate of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> as well
as of the contending candidates, for the carrying out of the examination and
analysis by <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> own and deputized fingerprint
and handwriting experts of the voting records in the four municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maganoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dinaig</span>, and for the
questioning of the chairmen of the boards of inspectors in said four towns,
during the November, 1970 elections for Constitutional Convention delegates, to
the extent necessary for <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to determine whether
or not the elec­tions therein were sham and the corresponding election returns
should be rejected and excluded as manufactured returns and insofar as the
results for tenth place winner would be affected thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the writs of <i>certiorari</i> and prohi­bition
are granted and the questioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolu­tion
RR- 89 of <st1:date year="1971" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1971</st1:date>,
specifically paragraphs 2 and 3 of its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion, is hereby annulled and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writ of preliminary injunction here­tofore issued against said
resolution is hereby made permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

proceedings not inconsistent with this decision, and particularly, as set forth
in the preceding para­graph, <span class="SpellE">whereafter</span> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> shall direct the provin­cial canvassing board to
reconvene and proclaim whomsoever among the remaining fifty-two (52) candidates
is the tenth place winner, in accordance with its find­ings, as to the
inclusion or exclusion of the questioned returns from the four towns subject of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Estaniel’s</span> petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the urgency of the case, involving
as it does, the determination of who is entitled to be pro claimed and to
discharge the functions of tenth delegate from <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
