yielding obedience to such statutory prescription, saw nothing objectionable in
a tax­payer taking advantage of such a provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That much is clear; it is settled beyond
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is involved in this appeal
from a lower court decision of November 24, 1965, dismissing a complaint by
plaintiff-appellant Republic of the Philippines, seeking the invalidation of
the payment by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Philippine Rabbit
Bus Lines, Inc. for the registration fees<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of its motor vehicles in the sum of P78, 636.17, in the form of such negotiable
<span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates of indebtedness, is the
applicability of such a provision to such a situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court held that it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While originally the matter
was elevated to the Court of Appeals, it was certified to us, the decisive
issue being one of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute
having restricted the privilege to the satisfaction of a tax, a liability for
fees under the police power being thus excluded from its benefits, we cannot
uphold the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint of plaintiff-appellant Republic of the Philippines
was filed on January 17, 1963 alleging that defendant?<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
as the registered owner of two hundred thirty eight (238) motor vehicles, paid
to the Motor Vehicles Office in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> the amount of
P78, 636.17, corresponding to the second installment of registration fees for
1959, not in cash but in the form of negotiable certificate of indebtedness,
the defendant being merely an assignee and not the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
holder itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint sought the
payment of such amount with surcharges plus the legal rate of interest from the
filing thereof and a declaration of the nullity of the use of such negotiable
certificate of indebtedness to satisfy its obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1963</st1:date>,
alleged that what it did was in accordance with law, both the Treasurer of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the General Auditing Office having signified their conformity to such a
mode of payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sought the dismissal
of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">After noting the respective theories of both parties in its
pleadings, the lower court, in its decision, stated that the issue before it
"is whether or not the acceptance of the negotiable certificates of
indebtedness tendered by defendant bus firm to and accepted by the Motor
Vehicles Office of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City and the corresponding
issuance of official receipts <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> acknowledging
such payment by said office is valid and binding on plaintiff Republic."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision now on appeal, the lower court, after referring
to a documentary evidence introduced by plaintiff-appellant continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"From the evidence adduced by defendant
bus firm, it appears that as early as August 28, 1958, the National Treasurer
upon whom devolves the function of administering the Back Pay Law (Republic Act
304 as amended by Republic Act Nos. 800 and 897), in his letter to the Chief of
the Motor Vehicles Office who in turn quoted and circularized same in his
Circular No. 5 dated September 1, 1958, to draw the attention thereto of all
Motor Vehicle Supervisors, Registrars and employees * * *, had approved the
acceptance of negotiable certificates of indebtedness in payment of regis­tration
fees of motor vehicles with the view that such certificates 'should be accorded
with the same confidence by other govern­mental instrumentalities as other
evidences of public debt, such as bonds and treasury certificates'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the Auditor General concurred
in the said view of the National Treasurer.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of plaintiff-appellant that only the holders of the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates themselves could apply the same to the
payment of motor vehicle registration fees did not find favor with the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "[Plaintiff] Republic
urges that defendant bus firm being merely an assignee of the negotiable
certificates of indebtedness in <span class="GramE">question,</span> it could not
use the same in payment of taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
contention, this Court believes, runs counter to the recitals appearing on the
said certificates which states that 'the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
hereby acknowledges to (name) or assigns * * *’, legally allowing the
assignment of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> rights."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It therefore, as above noted, rendered judgment in favor of
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> "upholding the validity and
efficacy" of such payment made and dismissing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal which, on the decisive
legal issue already set forth at the outset, we find meritorious.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->If a registration fee were a tax, then what was
done by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was strictly in accordance
with law and its nullity, as sought by plaintiff-appellant Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
cannot be decreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But is it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer to that question is decisive of
this controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A tax refers to a
financial obligation imposed by a state on persons, whether natural or
juridical, within its jurisdiction, for property owned, income <span class="GramE">earned,</span> business or profession engaged in, or any such
activity analogous in character for raising the necessary revenues to take care
of the responsibilities of government.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An often-quoted definition is that of Cooley:
"Taxes are the enforced proportional contributions from persons and
property levied by the state by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of
government and for all public needs."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As distinguished from other pecuniary burdens, the
differentiating factor is that the purpose to be <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>
is the raising of revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A tax then is
<span class="GramE">neither a penalty that must be satisfied or</span> a
liability arising from contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Much less can it be confused or identified with a license or a fee as a
manifestation of an exercise of the police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been settled law in this jurisdiction
as far back as <span class="SpellE">Cuunjieng</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Patstone</span>,
decided in 1922,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that this broad and all-encompassing governmental competence to restrict rights
of liberty and property carries with it the undeniable power to collect a
regulatory fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike a tax, it has not
for its object the raising of revenue but looks rather to the enactment of
specific measures that govern the relations not only as between individuals but
also as between private parties and the political society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from Cooley anew: "Legislation
for these purposes it would seem proper to look upon as being made in the
exercise of that authority * * * spoken of as the police power."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The registration fee which defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had to pay was imposed by Section 8 of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its heading speaks of "registration
fees."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term is repeated four
times in the body thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally so,
mention is made of the "fee for registration."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A subsection starts with a categorical
statement "No fees shall be charged."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The conclusion is difficult to resist therefore that the Motor Vehicle Act
requires the payment not of a tax but of a registration fee under the police
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the inapplicability of the
section relied upon by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> under the
Back Pay Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not held liable for
a tax but for a registration fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
therefore cannot make use of a <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificate to
meet such an obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Any vestige of any doubt as to the correctness of the above
conclusion should be dissipated by Republic Act No. 5448.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
A special science fund was thereby created and its title expressly sets forth
that a tax on privately-owned passenger automobiles, motorcycles and scooters
was imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rates thereof were
provided for in its Section 3 which clearly specifies that "additional
tax" was to be paid as distinguished from the registration fee under the
Motor Vehicle Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There cannot be any
clearer expression there­fore of the legislative will, even on the assumption
that the earlier legislation could by stretching the point be susceptible of
the interpretation that a tax rather than a fee was levied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is thus most apparent is that where the
legislative body relies on its authority to tax it expressly so states, and
where it is enacting a regulatory measure, it is equally explicit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may further be stated that a statute is meaningful not only by
what it includes but also by what it omits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is left out is not devoid of significance. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As observed by Frankfurter: "An omission
at the time of enactment, whether careless or calculated, cannot be judicially
supplied however much later wisdom may recommend the inclusion.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In the light of this consideration, the reversal of the appealed judgment is
unavoidable.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->In the brief for plaintiff-appellant Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
filed by the then Solicitor General, now Justice, Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, the principal error imputed to the trial court is
its failure to hold that the Back Pay Law prohibits an assignee, as is
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, from using certificates of
indebtedness to pay their taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view
of the conclusion reached by us that the liability of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> under the Motor Vehicle Act does not arise under
the taxing power of the state, there is no need to pass upon this particular
question.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in its brief, likewise assigned as error the failure of the lower court to hold
that <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> does not lie against the government for
mistakes committed by its agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
could be discerned from an excerpt of the decision earlier referred to, the
lower court was impressed by the fact that the national treasurer to whom it
correctly referred as being vested with the function of administering the <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> law did in a communication to the Motor Vehicles
Office approve the acceptance of negotiable certificates of indebtedness in
payment of registration fees, a view with which the Auditor General was in
concurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision
likewise noted: "By the testimonies of Pedro Flores, the then Registrar of
the Motor Vehicles Office of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Catbagan</span>, the Cashier of
the Bureau of Public Highways in the same city, defendant bus firm has
undisputedly shown that, after the said certificates of indebted­ness were
properly indorsed in favor of the Motor Vehicles Office of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City and accepted by the Bureau of Public Highways on May 29, 1959, it was duly
and properly issued official receipts * * * acknowledging full payment of its
registration fees for the second installment of 1959 of its 238 vehicles, and
that the Bureau of Public Highways, thru its collecting and disbursing officer,
was validly and regularly authorized to receive such payment."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus did the lower court, as pointed out by the then Solicitor
General, conclude that the government was bound by the mistaken interpretation
arrived at by the national treasurer and the auditor general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would consider <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
as applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estoppel</span> does not
lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a principle dates back to <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> de Romero v.

a 1919 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the taxing
power is concerned, Pineda v. Court of First Instance, a 1929 decision, speaks
categorically: "The Government is never <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
by mistake or error on the part of its agents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that, in so far as this record shows, the petitioners have
not made it appear that the additional tax claimed by the Collector is not in
fact due and collectible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assessment
of the tax by the Collector creates, it must be remembered, a charge that is at
least <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> valid."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

While the question here is one of the <span class="GramE">collection</span> of a
regulatory fee under the police power, reliance on the above course of
decisions is not inappropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
