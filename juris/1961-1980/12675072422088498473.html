				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal by <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes from the order « the Court of First Instance 
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, dismissing the complaint against the 
spouses Sinai C. Hamada and <span class="SpellE">Geralda</span> in Civil Case No. 
1041, by reason of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another action 
(Civil Case No. 1025 of the same court) between the same parties, over the same 
properties an where the cause of action in this case, if at all, properly be 
brought up. In this appeal, plaintiff-appellant assails the correctness of the 
aforesaid order of dismissal on the ground that there is no identity of cause of 
action between Civil Case No. 1025 and Civil Case No. 1041, because the issue in 
the first is the matter of ownership and possession of the properties in 
dispute, whereas second is concerned with the recovery of rentals paid to the 
defendants by the tenants of the properties, to which rentals 
plaintiff-appellant is allegedly entitled under the Rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts of this case are not 
<span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As a consequence of the extra 
judicial foreclosure proceeding instituted by the Philippine National Bank, 
certain real properties of the spouses Hamada, located in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and mortgaged to the said institution, were sold at 
public auction on February 11, 1960, and awarded to <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes, the highest bidder, for P38.000.00. At 10 
o'clock in the evening of February 10, 1961 (the last day of redemption), the 
mortgagors delivered to the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> 
checks covering the redemption amount, which payment was accepted by the said 
official. The purchaser Reyes, however, refused to recognize the validity of 
such redemption and thereafter demanded the delivery of possession of the 
properties which remained with the defendant-mortgagors. Upon refusal of the 
spouses Hamada to do so, Reyes died on March 9, 1961, Civil Case No. 1025 in the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> for declaration of 
ownership and right to possession of the said properties by reason of his 
purchase thereof at the auction sale of February 11, 1960. During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of said case, or on May 26, 1961, Reyes filed the 
complaint in the present case (Civil Case No. 1041), for recovery of the rentals 
paid by the tenants of the properties involved in the dispute to defendants 
Hamada, on the ground that under Section 30 of Rule 39 of the (old) Rules of 
Court, plaintiff, as purchaser of the properties, was entitled to the rentals 
receivable from the tenants thereof which were paid to the mortgagors during in 
f. after the period of redemption. Upon defendants «on to dismiss, the lower 
court issued the order now appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The question to be determined 
here is whether tendency of Civil Case No. 1025, wherein the validity of the 
tender of redemption price and the ownership and the right to possession of the 
properties are in issue, precludes the institution of another action for the 
recovery of rentals receivable from the same properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant bases his argument on 
Section 30 of Rule 89 of the old Rules of Court which 
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Sec. 
30.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE"><i>Rents and profits pending redemption.</i></span><i> Statement 
thereof and credit <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> on redemption.</i>—The 
purchaser, from the time of the sale until a redemption, and a <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, from the time of his redemption until another 
redemption, is entitled to receive the rents of the property sold or the value 
of the use and occupation thereof when such property is in the possession of a 
tenant But when any such rents and profits have been received by the judgment 
creditor or purchaser, or by a <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>, or by the 
assignee of either of them, from property thus sold preceding suck redemption, 
the amounts of such rents and profits shall be a credit upon the redemption 
money to be paid; * * *.',<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">and concludes that, as it is not 
denied that appellant was the purchaser of the properties at the public auction 
held on February 11, 1960 and the said properties were being occupied by paying 
tenants, the right to the rentals thereof, granted to the said purchaser by the 
provision, can not be abated by any ruling in the involving the ownership and 
possession of the same properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Construing this Section 30 of 
Rule 39, which is applicable also to properties purchased in extrajudicial 
closure proceeding, this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The rule, therefore, is clear 
that if during the period of redemption the judgment-debtor is in possession and 
the property sold, he is entitled to retain it and to receive its fruits, the 
purchaser not being entitled to its possession; but if the property is in the 
possession of a tenant, it is only then that the purchaser is entitled to 
receive its rents or the reasonable value of its use and occupation. In such a 
case, the purchaser is accountable for the amount thus received to the 
judgment—debtor he effects the redemption. * * *." <span class="GramE">(Chan vs. 
<span class="SpellE">Espe</span>, G.R. No.</span> L-16777, April 20, 
1961.)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other words, before the 
expiration of the 1-year period within which the judgment-debtor or mortgagor 
may redeem the property, the purchaser thereof is not entitled, as a matter of 
right, to possession of the same. Thus, while it is true that the Rules of Court 
allow the purchaser to receive the rentals if the purchased property is occupied 
by tenants, he is, nevertheless, accountable to the judgment-debtor or 
mortgagor, as the case may be, for the amount so received and the same will be 
duly credited against the redemption price when the said debtor or mortgagor 
effects the redemption. Differently stated, the rentals receivable from tenants, 
although they may be collected by the purchaser during the redemption period, do 
not belong to the latter but still pertain to the debtor or mortgagor. The 
rationale for the Rule, it seems, is to secure for the benefit of the debtor or 
mortgagor, the payment of the redemption amount and the consequent return to him 
of his properties sold at public auction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In Civil Case No. 1025, the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of which was the reason given by the lower court 
for dismissing Civil Case No. 1041, for recovery of rentals, the question 
involved is whether or not there was a proper and timely redemption of the 
properties sold at public auction. It is clear, therefore, that the right to the 
rentals during the period of redemption and thereafter is necessarily included 
in the issue of the timeliness and adequacy of the redemption made or exercised 
by the mortgagors. Consequently, the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil 
Case No. 1025 is a bar to the prosecution of Civil Case No. 1041, inasmuch as 
the issues in both cases can properly be resolved only in one. The lower court, 
therefore, committed no error in dismissing the complaint in this 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the order appealed from is 
hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
