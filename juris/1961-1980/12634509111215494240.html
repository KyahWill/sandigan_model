				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The parties in this case are co-owners of a parcel of land the
assessed value of which is <u>P137<span class="GramE">,800.00</span></u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> Plaintiff represents the late Jose <span class="SpellE">Zaldarriaga</span> who owns an undivided 1/8 share according to
the transfer certificates of title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants own the remaining 7/8 shares and are the ones in possession
of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the 34 years that
they have been in possession, defendants cultivated a certain portion (7/8) of
the entire land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remaining 1/8
portion is uncultivated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff would
like to have her specific portion of the property and has demanded an
accounting of the produce thereof, rentals, profits, etc., all in all amounting
to <u>P202<span class="GramE">,302.00</span></u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Court of First Instance upheld her right to
one-eight (1/8) of the hacienda and granted to plaintiff her share of the
produce, back rentals and profits, plus damages, all amounting to <u><span style="">P139,586.00</span></u><span style=""> </span>only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And after further
proceedings, the lower court decreed that plaintiff's one-eight (1/8) share be
taken from the cultivated portion of the land and the remaining cul­tivated and
uncultivated portions should go to defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter are now contesting the award and the court order.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the second time that this case is before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time it
was brought was on questions purely of law, i.e., whether the decision rendered
by the court merely ordering a partition was already <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>,
and We decided speaking thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> that it
was not yet proper for appeal; hence it was remanded for continuation of the
partition proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, ques­tions
of fact and law are involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law provides that the Supreme Court shall have exclusive
appellate jurisdiction in "all civil cases in which the value in
controversy exceeds two hundred thou­sand pesos, exclusive of interest and
costs, or in which the title or possession of real estate exceeding in va­lue
the sum of two hundred thousand pesos to be ascer­tained by the oath of a party
to the cause or by other competent evidence, is involved or brought in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Sec. 17, par. 3, No. 5 of R.A. 296 as amended)</p>

<p class="BODY">Since plaintiff did not appeal from the decision, this Court
cannot increase the award of P139<span class="GramE">,586.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That amount <span style="">is, </span>for purposes of appeal, the value in contro­versy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While title to real estate is involved and
the whole land has an assessed value of P137<span class="GramE">,800.00</span>, yet
the parties are disputing only the 1/8 portion thereof that should go to
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff does not want the
entire hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1/8 of P137<span class="GramE">,800.00</span> is <u>P</u><u><span style="">17,300.00</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Adding
this to the disputed award of P139<span class="GramE">,586.00</span>, the result
is <u><span style="">P156,886.00</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence,
not exceeding P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants raise 22 errors but only 5 involve ques­tions purely
of law; the rest involve factual questions (since defendants assail the factual
findings of the lower court) and mixed questions of fact and law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the complaint asked for P202<span class="GramE">,302.00</span>,
the amount involved in the appeal is P156,886.00 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u><span style="">IMPERIAL
v. </span></u><st1:place><u><span style="">MANILA</span></u></st1:place><u><span style=""> TIMES</span></u><span style="">, </span>L-17430, <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="11">Nov. 30,
 1962</st1:date>, the complaint asked for P250<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
but the trial court awar­ded only P15,000.00 to each of the two
plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only defendants appealed and
their assignments of error in­volved factual questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held that it had no jurisdiction
and certified the case to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this appeal is hereby certified to the Court of
Appeals.</p>
