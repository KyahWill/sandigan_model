				G.R. No. L-17778, November 30, 1962</h4>
				<H3>IN RE CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ARMANDO RAMOS. JESUS L. CARMELO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PROBE COMMITTEE, OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF MANILA, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. ARMANDO RAMOS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 3, 1960, the Mayor of Manila issued an executive order creating a 
committee "to investigate the anomalies involving the license inspectors and 
other personnel of the License Inspection Division of the Office of the City 
Treasurer and of the License and Permits Division of this Office (of the 
Mayor)." He named Mr. Jesus L. Carmelo as chairman of said committee.
<p>It appears that the committee issued subpoenas to Armando Ramos, a private 
citizen working as a bookkeeper in the Casa de Alba, requiring him to appear 
before it on June 3, 8, 9, 15 and 16 and August 4 and 11, 1960, in connection 
with an administrative case against Crisanto Estanislao but that Ramos, on whom 
the subpoenas were duly served, refused to appear.</p>
<p>Claiming that Ramos' refusal tended "to impede, obstruct, or degrade the 
administrative proceedings," petitioner filed in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila a petition to declare Armando Ramos in contempt. After hearing, during 
which petitioner was required to show a <i>prima facie</i> case, the trial court 
dismissed the petition. The lower court held that there is no law empowering 
committees created by municipal mayors to issue subpoenas and demand that 
witnesses testify under oath. It also held that to compel Ramos to testify would 
be to violate his right against self-incrimination.</p>
<p>It appears that in a statement given to investigators of the office of the 
Mayor, Ramos admitted having misappropriated, on several occasions, sums of 
money given to him by the owner of Casa de Alba for the payment of the latter's 
taxes for 1956-1959 and that this fact had not been discovered earlier because 
Ramos used to entertain employees in the City Treasurer's office at Casa de Alba 
where Ramos was a bookkeeper as stated above. The trial court held that to 
compel Ramos to confirm this statement in the administrative case against 
certain employees in the Office of the City Treasurer would be to compel him to 
give testimony that could be used against him in a criminal case for estafa of 
which the owner of Casa de Alba was the offended party. From that decision, 
petitioner appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>The main issue in this case is the power, if any, of a committee, like the 
committee of which petitioner is the chairman, to subpoena witnesses to appear 
before it and to ask for their punishment in case of refusal.</p>
<p>The rule is that Rule 64 (Contempt)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
of the Rules of Court applies only to inferior and superior courts and does not 
comprehend contempt committed against administrative officials or bodies like 
the one in this case, unless said contempt is clearly considered and expressly 
defined as <i>contempt of court</i>, as in done in paragraph 2 of Section 580 of 
the Revised Administrative Code. (People vs. Mendoza and Dizon, 92 Phil., 570; 
49 Off. Gaz. No. 2, 541)</p>
<p>Petitioner invokes Section 580 of the Revised Administrative Code which 
provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Powers incidental to taking of testimony</i>. When authority to take 
testimony or evidence is conferred upon an administrative officer or upon any 
nonjudicial person, committee, or other body, such authority shall be understood 
to comprehend the right to administer oaths and summon witnesses and shall 
include authority to require the production of documents under a <i>subpoena 
duces tecum</i> or otherwise, subject in all respects to the same restrictions 
and qualifications as apply in judicial proceedings of a similar character.</p>
<p>"Saving the provisions of section one hundred and two of this Act, any one 
who, without lawful excuse, falls to appear upon summons issued under the 
authority of the preceding paragraph or who, appearing before any individual or 
body exercising the power therein defined, refuses to make oath, give testimony, 
or produce documents for inspection, when thereunto lawfully required, shall be 
subject to discipline as in case of contempt of court and upon application of 
the individual or body exercising the power in question shall be dealt with by 
the judge of first instance having jurisdiction of the case in the manner 
provided by law."</p></blockquote>
<p>One who invokes this provision of the law must first show that he has 
"authority to take the testimony or evidence" before he can apply to the courts 
for the punishment of hostile witnesses. (Francia vs. Pecson, et al., 87 Phil., 
100)</p>
<p>Now, what authority to take testimony does petitioner's committee have from 
which the power to cite witnesses may be implied, pursuant to section 580?</p>
<p>To be sure, there is nothing said in the executive order of the Mayor 
creating the committee about such a grant of power. All that the order gives to 
this body is the power to investigate anomalies involving certain city 
employees.</p>
<p>Petitioner contends that the Mayor of Manila has the implied power to 
investigate city officials and employees appointed by him to the end that the 
power expressly vested in him to suspend and remove such officials or employees 
(Sec. 22, Republic Act No. 409) may be justly and fairly exercised. We agree 
with this proposition and We held so in the case of Pagkanluñgan vs. de la 
Fuente, 92 Phil., 94; 48 Off. Gaz., No. 10, p. 4332. But We do not agree with 
the petitioner that a delegation of such power to investigate implies also a 
delegation of the power to take testimony or evidence of witnesses whose 
appearance may be required by the compulsory process of subpoena. Thus, in 
denying this power to an investigating body in the Office of the Mayor of 
Manila, We said in Francia vs. Pecson, et al., <i>supra</i>: "We do not think 
the mayor (of Manila) can delegate or confer the powers to administer oaths, to 
take testimony, and to issue subpoenas."</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is doubtful whether the provisions of section 580 of the 
Administrative Code are applicable to the City of Manila as these pertain to 
national bureaus or offices of the government.</p>
<p>Citing 50 Am. Jur. 449, petitioner contends that "the power of the 
investigation committee to issue compulsory process to secure the attendance of 
witnesses undoubtedly exists since only complimentary to the power of the mayor 
to investigate, suspend and remove city officers and employees, <i>supra</i>, is 
the recognized rule that where the statute grants a right, it also confers by 
implication every particularly power necessary for the exercise thereof." There 
is no merit in the argument. In the first place, the authority cited speaks of 
statutory grant of power to a body. Here, We have seen that whatever power may 
be claimed by petitioner's committee may only be traced to the power of the 
Mayor to investigate as implied from his power to suspend or remove certain city 
employees. There is no statutory grant of power to investigate to petitioner's 
committee.</p>
<p>In the second place, even granting that the Mayor has the implied power to 
require the appearance of witnesses before him, the rule, as noted earlier, is 
that the Mayor can not delegate this power to a body like the committee of the 
petitioner. (Francia vs. Pecson, et al., <i>supra</i>)</p>
<p>Lastly, 50 Am. Jur. Sec. 428, p. 450 itself admits an exception to the rule 
invoked by the petitioner. Thus, it is stated that "where the liberty and 
property of persons are sought to be brought within the operation of a power 
claimed to be impliedly granted by an act because necessary to its due 
execution, the case must be clearly seen to be within those intended to be 
reached." Here, no less than the liberty of Armando Ramos is involved in the 
claim of the committee to the right to cite witnesses.</p>
<p>We hold, therefore, that petitioner's committee has no power to cite 
witnesses to appear before it and to ask for their punishment in case of 
refusal. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for Us to pass upon the other 
error assigned by petitioner as having been allegedly committed by the trial 
court.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila is hereby 
affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>

<font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> Section 4 of this rule provides in part: 
"<i>Charge; Where filed</i>.—* * *And where a contempt punishable by law has 
been committed against an administrative officer or any non-judicial person, 
committee, or other body, the charge may be filed with the Court of First 
Instance of the province or city in which the contempt has been committed." This provision of Rule 64 embodies the historical notion that the contempt 
power is necessarily judicial. This notion dates as far back as 1893, when the 
Supreme Court of the United States, in ICC vs. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, remarked 
that such body as the Interstate Commerce Commission "could not, under our 
system of government, and consistently with due process of law, be invested with 
authority to compel obedience to its orders by a judgment of fine or 
imprisonment." But the Court went on to hold that a judicial proceeding to 
enforce a subpoena issued by the Commission satisfies the "case" or 
"controversy" requirement of the Constitution and that judicial enforcement does 
not violate the principle of separation of powers. Accordingly, since 1893, the 
Congress of the United States has consistently refused to empower any agency to 
commit for contempt, customarily providing instead that agencies may apply to 
appropriate district court for an order enforceable by contempt proceedings.
