				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From <span style="">1947 </span>to about
six years thereafter, respondent Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span> was
employed in the National Development Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="6">June <span style="">30, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>she
was discharged on account of total disability for labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At said time, her desig­nation was that of
spare weaver, at <span style="">P4.45 </span>a
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No benefits were paid by the
company except the medical treatment given by the company physician.</p>

<p class="BODY">As of the early part of <span style="">1952,
</span><span class="SpellE">Ayson</span> was still in good health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the later part of that year, however,
following an accident in the course of her employment, she began to spit blood
whenever she exerted pressure.</p>

<p class="BODY">After medical examination, <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span> was
diagnosed as suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As afore-stated, the National Development Co.
gave her free medical treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
also engaged the services of a private doctor, as well as had herself treated
in the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute, and incurred other medical
expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Alleging that her total disability is
compensable under Act No.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>3428
(Workmen's Compensation Act), <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span> filed on February
<span style="">27, 1961 </span>a claim for disability
compen­sation against the National Development Co., in the Regional Office of
the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent company answered on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="8">August <span style="">9, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>disclaiming liability and alleging
that, at the time of her discharge, <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span> was sick of
eczema, not of PTB, and that her work in the company was light and easy.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the Department's hearing officer rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1963</st1:date>,
granting the claim and ordering respondent to pay <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span>
P3<span class="GramE">,407.04</span> under Sec­tion 14 of the Act; P1,300.00 for
medical expenses allowed under Section 13 of the same law; P170.35 for
attorney's fees and P31.00 by way of fees for the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Review of said decision was sought with the Work­men's
Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1964</st1:date>, the Workmen's
Compensation Commissioner's decision affirmed the award as to the sums of P3<span class="GramE">,407.04</span> and P1,300.00 and increased the attorney's fees to
P255.53 plus P40.00 as fees for the WCC fund.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reconsideration thereof was sought by the company but denied by the Commission
en banc in its resolution of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="7">July 28,
 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">National Development Co<span class="GramE">.,</span> thereupon
appealed to Us from the decision and resolution of the WCC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would, firstly, raise the point of time limitation
under Section 24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unmeritorious
for it never filed an employer's report with notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
resulting in its renunciation and waiver of the defense that the claim is
barred for being, filed outside of the two-month period stated in Section 24
(National Development Co. v. WCC, L-20504, March 31, 1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And besides, claimant substantially complied
with Section 24 by requesting <span style="">financial
</span>benefits from the company's Acting General Manager, within a week from
the receipt of her discharge letter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such request amounts to an advanced filing of the claim (<span class="SpellE">Saulog</span> v.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Del
Rosario, 103 Phil., 765; <span class="SpellE">Lusteveco</span> v. WCC, L-19742, <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="1">Jan. 31, 1964</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, appellant would contend that <span class="SpellE">Ayson's</span>
illness is not due to her employment, since her work was light and easy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows however that claimant
frequently worked in the night shift and that, before she developed PTB in
1952-1953, her work included pushing heavy wagons of cloth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Substantial evidence there­fore shows that
her PTB was caused by her employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
any rate, there is no rebutting evidence to the contrary, so that the
presumption stands that an illness arising in the course of the employment
arose <u>out</u> of it (Agustin v. WCC, L-19957, Sept. 29, 1964).</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding, lastly, the amount of the award, there is no proof
that <span class="SpellE">Ayson's</span> total disability has ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, full compensation for the same,
as given, is warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to the
grant of P1, 300.00 for medical expenses, the same is reasonable, considering
that claimant was treated by a private doctor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rest of the award is not questioned as to amount.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision and resolution of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission in favor of claimant are hereby affirmed, with costs
against appellant.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
