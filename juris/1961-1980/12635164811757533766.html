				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appellant Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Torino</span> were charged with
murder in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the latter remained at
large for sometime, the case went on only against appellant who, after trial
upon a plea of not guilty, was convicted as charged and sentenced to suffer the
penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, with the accessory
penalties of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> in the sum of
P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, and to pay <span style="">the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> died of a stab wound inflicted upon him in the
evening of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="11">November <span style="">27, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> at the wharf area of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ozamis</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant admits having stabbed the deceased but claims that he
did it in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was,
therefore, incumbent upon him to establish all the facts necessary to prove
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his brief he states
what, according to him, were the circumstances under which he stabbed the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On a certain occasion before <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1965</st1:date>, Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>
was eating inside the store of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gutierez</span> located
at the wharf, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unexpectedly, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> came and asked Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>
for a drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In retort, the latter told
the former that his money was just enough to pay for what he was eating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Utterly dismayed, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> went out of the store murmuring something.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="11">November 27,
 1965</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span>
with a compa­nion went to the dance at <span class="SpellE">Katagalogan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few moments after seeing the dance, he
inquired from one Romeo <span class="SpellE">Oligo</span>, in-charge of the <span style="">dance, as to where Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>latter told the former
that Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> was at the wharf waiting for a
boat to work on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> got mad at Romeo <span class="SpellE">Oligo</span>,
and sternly forewarned him that once he gets back to the dance and sees Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> thereat, he (Romeo <span class="SpellE">Oligo</span>)
would be implicated in a case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> proceeded to the wharf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he saw Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>
coming out of the store of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gutierez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> exclaimed, '<span class="GramE">Here</span> <span style="">is Eddie!’ </span>Right
then and there he rushed toward Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>, drew
<span style="">a </span>hunting
knife and thrust it upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
latter parried the hunting knife by giving a sudden stroke with his open palm
with straight fingers closed together to the right hand of the former which
held the said weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weapon dropped
to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> picked up the hunting knife and a vigorous
struggle between the two ensued as one was trying to overpower the other,
especially Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> who labored hard to defend
his life and limbs against the homicidal assault of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Simplicio</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> held the
left hand of Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> with his two hands, the
former pulled the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Eddie <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> resisted and tried to get himself free from </span><span style="">the hold of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inorder</span> to extricate himself, he stabbed the left arm </span>of
his assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resultantly, he was released
and so he ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to the house
of his uncle, Luis <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Katagalogan</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he was staying at that time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In that scuffle, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> sustained two stab wounds, one on his breast, left
side, and the other on his left arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
these wounds were caused by one thrust only."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As against the above, <span class="GramE">We</span> have the
testimony of several prosecution witnesses which, according to the lower court,
established the following:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears from the evidence for the prosecution that prior
to <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1965</st1:date>, the
accused and the late <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span>
had grudges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> in
the evening of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span>, Alan
Perez, Rene <span class="SpellE">Balatero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Apdal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Omelig</span> were at the wharf, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were conversing, the accused Eddie
<span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>, accompanied by one <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Torino</span></st1:place>, came.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Torino</span></st1:place> placed his arm
around the shoulders of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> and engaged him in
a conversation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While so conversing, the
accused <span class="SpellE">suddently</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
with a pointed hunting knife, hitting him on his left breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Torino</span></st1:place>
faced Rene <span class="SpellE">Balatero</span> and asked him if he would defend <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> to which <span class="SpellE">Balatero</span>
replied that he did not have anything to do with the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Torino</span></st1:place>
nevertheless boxed him but he was not hit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> ran towards the PC
Headquarters, followed by Rene <span class="SpellE">Balatero</span>, The others
ran in different directions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> was at once <span style="">brought
to </span>the <st1:place><st1:placename>Rico</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Medina</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>
of the <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City Police Department took his dying
declaration, Exhibit 'A'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Medina examined
<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> and found on his body two injuries, one at
the left arm and the other, on his left side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The injury on the left side was fatal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was only one thrust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cause
of death was <span style="">external
hemorrhage, secondary to the </span>stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lt <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tamparong</span></span><span style="">, Sgt </span><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span> and other
members of the <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City Police Department went to
the house of the accused to arrest him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching the premises, they were informed that <span style="">the accused was in the house of his uncle,
Luis <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lt. <span class="SpellE">Tamparong</span> <span style="">and companions proceeded to this house </span>and inquired for the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the accused appeared, Lt <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tamparong</span></span><span style=""> asked him if he was the one who stabbed <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> </span>and he
answered in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also asked to produce the hunting
knife used in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> and he gave it to
Lt. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tamparong</span></span><span style=""> who in turn delivered it to the </span>sergeant
of the guard."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Made to choose between the version given by the prosecution
witnesses, on the one hand, and those of the defense, on the other, the trial
court arrived at the definite conc<span style="">lusion
that </span>"the accused is guilty of murder" because while <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Simplicio</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> and
four others were conversing merrily near the wharf, appellant, accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Torino</span>, arrived at the
place; that immediately <span class="SpellE">Torino</span> placed his arm around <span class="SpellE">Simplicio's</span> shoulders and engaged him <span style="">in a conversation; that suddenly appellant
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> on the latter’s left arm, the
weapon </span>penetrating his side, as a result of which he died of hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>agree entirely with the lover court, <span style="">particularly when it held that if the deceased, armed with a hunting
knife, </span>was really the first to attack appellant, the latter could not
have avoided suffering physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact, however, <span style="">is </span>that
he suffered no "injury at all, not even <span style="">a </span>scratch".</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the record, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find no justification at all to change the findings and conclusions of the
trial court with respect to the facts of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed,
except that the indemnity of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span> to be paid by
appellant to the heirs of the deceased is increased to P12,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a <span style="">result, our
resolution of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January </span>17, 1968</st1:date> granting
appellant's motion to be released on bail <span style="">is </span><span style="">set aside, and the bail bond submitted by him
in </span>that connection is hereby disapproved.</p>
