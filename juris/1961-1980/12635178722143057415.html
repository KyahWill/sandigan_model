				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the accused-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span>, from a conviction by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, in its Criminal Case
No. <span class="GramE">OZ-383, for robbery with quadruple homicide.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meted to the appellant was the penalty of <u>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> and the indemnification of the heirs of
the four (4) deceased victims at P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for each
victim, aside from the restoration of the amount of P2,000.00 which the court
found to have been the object of the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant's co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span>, his brother, was acquitted on reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution showed the following:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumigaw</span>
and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Dagaw</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumingit</span>,
lived in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tuno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tudela</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, where they owned lands planted to
abaca, coconut, corn and rice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
barrio of <span class="SpellE">Tuno</span> is remote and mountainous and
inhabited mostly by a cultural minority known as "<span class="SpellE">Subanos</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sayawon's</span> house,
which was built atop a hill, had an attic; there, according to prosecution
witness <span class="SpellE">Biato</span> <span class="SpellE">Mapon</span>,
widowed son-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>, the couple kept two
(2) jars of money, in coins, amounting to P2,000.00; <span class="SpellE">Biato</span>
had carried these jars himself when they transferred from the old house (T. s.
n., 13 June 1967, page 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dana, the
wife of <span class="SpellE">Biato</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Amping</span>,
a son of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>, also lived in the same dwelling.</p>

<p class="BODY">Along a trail leading to <span class="SpellE">Sayawon's</span>
house is the house of <span class="SpellE">Bastiana</span> Soling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gumalay</span> testified that he was there on 25 September
1965, at around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon (to judge from the position of
the sun), and while grinding corn by the doorway he saw three (3) persons pass
by; he recognized one of them to be the accused <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
witness did not recognize the other two because their hats were tilted,
covering their eyes (T. s. n., 13 June 1967, pages 12-13).</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal witness of the prosecution, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sandalan</span>, who did not know his age, was estimated to
be 14 years old at the time he testified in 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness declared that he and his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumigaw</span>, went to the "<span class="SpellE">pari</span>-an" on 25 September 1965; <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>
won a cock there and, on their way home, <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>
invited <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> to drop by his house as he wanted to
give him half of the cock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arrived
at <span class="SpellE">Sayawon's</span> house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, reckoned by the position of
the sun; they found three (3) men already in the house, armed with long <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sandalan</span> recognized two of them as <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span>, because they were abaca strippers in the plantation
of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>; he did not know the third man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> requested that he and his two companions be allowed
to pass the night in the house, as it was already getting dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After witness <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sandalan</span> had received his share of the cock, he left
and proceeded home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was some 70
to 80 meters away, by a brook where he had defecated, he heard a woman's shout
for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He returned to <span class="SpellE">Sayawon's</span> house; he did not go up but went underneath the
house and, through the split-bamboo flooring and by the dim light of a "<span class="SpellE">gota-percha</span>" lamp (it was already twilight), he saw
the accused <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span>
cutting the neck of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span> who lay upon a
mortar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Sandalan</span>
did not tarry but rushed home and told his parents what he saw; they did not
believe him, as he had been wont to lie to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when they went to <span class="SpellE">Sayawon's</span>
house the following morning to verify what their son had related they found the
four (4) occupants of the house dead:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sayawon's</span> body was on top of a mortar, his head almost
severed at the neck; <span class="SpellE">Dagaw</span>, hacked at the back of the
neck, lay on the floor near the stove; <span class="SpellE">Amping</span> lay
face downward where he used to sleep, hacked at the nape and on the arm; and
Dana was sprawled flat on her stomach at the attic, injured at the <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span> region (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., 23
February 1967, pages 32-42; 24 February 1967, pages 2, 8 and 27; 13 June 1967,
page 6).</p>

<p class="BODY">PC Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> <span class="SpellE">Jonco</span>
testified that he had <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span>
investigated on 9 October 1965; that he propounded the questions and <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> supplied the answers which were reduced to writing'
(T. s. n., 23 February 1967, pages 2-3); that thereafter, on 11 October 1965,
Sgt. Alberto <span class="SpellE">Orquillas</span> brought <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span> to the municipal judge to swear to the truth of
his statements but, according to <span class="SpellE">Orquillas</span>, after
talking to a certain person <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> refused to sign the
statement for no reason at all (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., 23 February
1967, page 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unsigned statement,
Exhibit "A", purported to confess <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande's</span> participation in a conspiracy to rob the household
of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>; his presence there during the killing of
the four victims, not by him but by his brother, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>,
and one Malcolm; and his confessing to the Philippine Constabulary officers
because he was not given a share of the booty that Malcolm had taken from a jar
in the attic.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the side of the defense, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span>, testifying in his behalf, claimed that during
the whole day of 25 September 1965 he, together with eight (8) other persons,
incluÂ­ding his brother <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>, worked "<span class="SpellE">bayanihan</span>" style in the farm of Rosario <span class="SpellE">Limbaring</span> in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lalud</span> until
sundown; when they stopped working, they took their "<span class="SpellE">merienda</span>"
and then <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> went
home (<span class="SpellE">T.s</span>. n., 12 July 1967, pages 30-34).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>alibi</u> deserves no credit for the
supporting witnesses, Abdul and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumbay</span>, were vague and uncertain in their statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only circumstance of which they were
positive was of <span class="SpellE">Gande's</span> presence at the "<span class="SpellE">songlo</span>" (cooperative work) on 25 June, but could not
supply details about the work on the other days of the week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We conclude that no error was committed by
the court in rejecting the <u>alibi</u> of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with counsel <u>de
<span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u> that appellant <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span> cannot be held guilty of robbery with quadruple
homicide, but only of homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant testified that three (3) PC soldiers manhandled him,
one after the other, to compel him to sign Exhibit "A"; that he was
shown the said exhibit already prepared but did not see how it was prepared;
that, as a result of the maltreatment, he suffered injuries, which he had shown
to the judge of <span class="SpellE">Tudela</span> and to a friend, Abdul <span class="SpellE">Lumbay</span>, who visited him in jail; that he did not recognize
his torturers because it was nighttime; and that he is illiterate and belongs
to the <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> tribe (T. s. n., 12 July 1967, pages
2-4, 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the appellant is supported by Judge <span class="SpellE">Solidario</span> <span class="SpellE">Agot</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tudela</span>, who testified that Exhibit "A" was
presented to him but that the supposed affiant, appellant <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span>, "disagreed on all the statement of that
affidavit" and "refused to sign because it was not voluntarily made
by him"; and that he saw a fresh contusion on the lower part of <span class="SpellE">Gande's</span> right eye but the latter did not complain that he was
maltreated by the PC (T. s. n., 19 July 1967, pages 3-4, 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is regrettable that the judge did not
examine the rest of the body of appellant to ascertain whether he suffered
other injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
circumstances sufficiently infirm the reliability of the purported confession,
particularly since there is no independent evidence of the alleged robbery; no
proof exists on the record that the coins asserted by witness <span class="SpellE">Biato</span> <span class="SpellE">Mapon</span> to have been kept in
two jars placed in the attic were still there when the crime was
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the accused did not
complain of torture to Judge <span class="SpellE">Agot</span> is not to be
wondered at, for being in the custody of his torturers he was reasonably
apprehensive of <span class="GramE">further</span> maltreatment if he
complained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the circumstances
of record, the alleged statements of appellant are rejected as of no probative
value.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the alleged confession (Exhibit "Aâ) aside, the
evidence on the alleged conspiracy consists of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gumalay</span>, to the effect
that he saw <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span>,
with two companions, pass by the house of <span class="SpellE">Bastiana</span>
Soling towards the house of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumigaw</span> while said witness was grinding corn, and the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sandalan</span>
that he saw the <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> brothers and a third man armed
with long <span class="SpellE">boloes</span> when he and <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>
came from the "<span class="SpellE">pari</span>-an" and that he saw <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> cutting the neck of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sandalan</span> had
vacillated in his testimony, or was unsure of what <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gande</span> and the third man did or were doing when <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> was cutting <span class="SpellE">Sayawon's</span> neck,
and it was on account of this uncertainty that the lower court acquitted <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Gande</span> (the third man
was not charged in the information).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such actions of the appellant and his brother and even of the
non-accused third man do not warrant a finding of the existence of a
conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just because they were seen
together draws no inference of a common plan to commit a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no convincing evidence that <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> and the third man committed any overt act or
actively participated in concert with appellant's act of killing <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>, or in connection with the death of the other
victims, as to deduce a unity of action and purpose among themselves (Article
8, Revised Penal Code; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Asaad</span>, 55 Phil.
697; People vs. Wong, L-22130-32, 29 April 1968; People vs. Vicente, L-26241,
21 May 1969).</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there evidence that the money, testified to by <span class="SpellE">Mapon</span> as having been kept in the attic, was still there or
that it was taken away by the accused after the death of the four (4)
victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the witnesses for the
prosecution who went to the house after the commission of the crime testified
as to the absence or loss of the money; not even Sgt. Manuel <span class="SpellE">MuÃ±oz</span>, who went there precisely to investigate and even
drew a sketch of the house and the respective positions of the victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the taking of the money cannot be
presumed; it must be proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the loss or disappearance of the money was not proved, two
essential elements of robbery are missing, namely: intent to gain (<u>animus <span class="SpellE">lucrandi</span></u>) and unlawful taking or <span class="SpellE">asportation</span>
(Padilla, Criminal Law, Vol. II, page 635).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view thereof, <span class="GramE">We</span> can not declare that there
was robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">While appellant's defense of <u>alibi</u>, as previously
discussed, cannot prevail over his positive identification by witness <span class="SpellE">Sandalan</span> as the one who cut the neck of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span>
(People vs. Estrada (1968), 22 SCRA 112; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
(1968), 22 SCRA 1091), there is no proof, nor can it be presumed, that
appellant also killed <span class="SpellE">Dagaw</span>, Dana and <span class="SpellE">Amping</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the crime committed by appellant is only a single homicide,
aggravated by its commission in the victim's <span class="GramE">dwelling,</span>
a circumstance balanced by appellant's being illiterate and dissociated from
the civilized community.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Having taken lack of instruction into account, application of Section 106 of
the Administrative Code of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> is no
longer warranted,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="GramE">specially</span> since the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence
law also apply to reduce the penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proper punishment should be a minimum within the range of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> in its medium degree and a
maximum of <u>reclusion temporal</u>, also in the medium degree.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is hereby modified,
finding appellant <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganda</span>
guilty of a single homicide and imposing upon him the penalty of not less than
10 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> and not more
than 17 years of <u>reclusion temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant is further sentenced to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Sayawon</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumigaw</span> in the amount of
P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the costs.</p>
