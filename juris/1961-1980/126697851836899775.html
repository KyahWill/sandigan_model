<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 4, 1959, the Chief 
of Police of <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, Laguna, charged <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> Villanueva with the crime of Malicious Mischief, 
before the Justice of the Peace Court of said municipality. Said accused was 
represented by counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, but later on 
replaced by counsel de <span class="SpellE">parte</span>. The complainant in the 
same case was represented by City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Ariston</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Fule</span> of San Pablo City, having entered his appearance 
as private-prosecutor, after securing the permission of the Secretary of 
Justice. The condition of his appearance as such, was that every time he would 
appear at the trial of the case, he would be considered on official leave of 
absence, and that he would not receive any payment for his services. The 
appearance of City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> as private prosecutor 
was questioned by the counsel for the accused, invoking the case of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, et al. vs. Blanco, et al, 79 Phil. 647 wherein it 
was ruled that "when an attorney had been appointed to the position of Assistant 
Provincial Fiscal or City Fiscal and therein qualified, by operation of law, he 
ceased to engage in private law practice." Counsel then argued that the JP Court 
in entertaining the appearance of City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> 
in the case is a violation of the above ruling, On December 17, 1960 the JP 
issued an order sustaining the legality of the appearance of City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under date of </span><st1:date month="1" day="4" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 4, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
counsel for the accused presented a "Motion to Inhibit Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> from Acting as Private Prosecutor in this Case," this 
time invoking Section 32, Rule 127, now Sec. 35, Rule 138, <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Rules, which bars certain attorneys from practicing. 
Counsel claims that City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> falls under 
(his limitation. The JP Court ruled on the motion by upholding the right of 
<span class="SpellE">Fule</span> to appear and further stating that he (<span class="SpellE">Fule</span>) was not actually engaged in private law practice. This 
Order was appealed to the CFI of Laguna, presided by the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> U. <span class="SpellE">Jarencio</span>, which 
rendered judgment on December 20, 1961, the pertinent portions of which 
read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The present case is one for 
malicious mischief. There being no reservation by the offended party of the 
civil liability, the civil action was deemed <span class="GramE">impliedly</span> 
instituted with the criminal action. The offended party had, therefore, the 
right to intervene in the case and lie represented by a legal counsel because of 
her interest in the civil liability of the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sec. 31, Rule 127 of the Rules 
of Court provides that in the court of a justice of the peace a party may 
conduct his litigation in person, with the aid of an agent or friend appointed 
by him for that purpose, or with the aid of an attorney. Assistant City Attorney 
<span class="SpellE">Fule</span> appeared in the Justice of the Peace Court as ah 
agent or friend of the offended party. It does not appear that he was being paid 
for his services or that his appearance was in a professional capacity. As 
Assistant City Attorney of Sail Pablo he had no control or intervention 
whatsoever in the prosecution of crimes committed in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, Laguna, because the <span class="GramE">prosecution 
of criminal cases coming from <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span> are</span> 
handled by the Office of the Provincial Fiscal and not by the City Attorney of 
San Pablo. There could be no possible conflict in the duties of Assistant City 
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> us Assistant City Attorney of San Pablo 
and as private prosecutor in this criminal case. On the other hand, us already 
pointed out, the offended party in this criminal case had a right to be 
represented by an agent or a friend to protect her rights in the civil action 
which was impliedly instituted together with the criminal 
action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In view of the foregoing, this 
Court holds that Asst. City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Ariston</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> may appear before the Justice of the Peace Court in 
<span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lagunu</span> as private 
prosecutor in this criminal case as an agent or a friend of the offended 
party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, the appeal from the 
order of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, 
Laguna, allowing the appearance of <span class="SpellE">Ariston</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> as private prosecutor is dismissed, without 
costs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above decision is the subject 
of the instant proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appeal should be dismissed, 
for patently being without merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Aside from the considerations 
advanced by the learned trial judge, heretofore reproduced, and which We 
consider plausible, the fallacy of the theory of defense counsel lies in his 
confused interpretation of Section 32 of Rule 127 (now Sec. 35, Rule 138, 
Revised Rules), which provides that "no judge or other official or employee of 
the superior courts or of the office of the Solicitor General, shall engage in 
private practice as a member of the bar or give professional advice to clients." 
he claims that City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span>, in appearing as 
private prosecutor in the case was engaging in private practice. We believe that 
the isolated appearance of City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> did not 
constitute private practice, within the meaning and contemplation of the Rules. 
Practice is more than an isolated appearance, for it consists in frequent or 
customary action, a succession of acts of the same kind. In other words, it is 
frequent habitual exercise (State vs. <span class="SpellE">Cotner</span>, 127, p. 
1, 87 Kan. 864, 42 LRA, N.S. 768). Practice of law to fall within the 
prohibition of statute has been interpreted as customarily or habitually holding 
one's self out to the public, as a lawyer and demanding payment for such 
services (State vs. Bryan, 4 S. E. 522, 98 N. C. 644, 647). The appearance as 
counsel on one <span class="GramE">occasion,</span> is not conclusive as 
determinative of engagement in the private practice of law. The following 
observation of the Solicitor General is noteworthy:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Essentially, the word private 
practice of law implies that one must have presented himself to be in the active 
and continued Practice of the legal profession and that his professional 
services available to the public for a compensation, as a source of livelihood 
or in consideration of his said services."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For one thing, it has never been 
refuted that City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> had been given 
permission by his immediate superior, the Secretary of Justice, to represent the 
complainant in the case at bar, who is a relative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Conformably with all the 
foregoing, the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby affirmed, in 
all respects, with costs against appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
