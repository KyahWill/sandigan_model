review the decision of the Court of Appeals in its CA - G. R. No. 01599-CR.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as found by the Court of Appeals are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="4">Sunday,
 April 12, 1959</st1:date>, on the <st1:place><st1:placetype>beach</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Diculum</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte, <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> engaged appellant <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span> in a fistic
fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were surrounded by appellant
<span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>, brother
of appellant <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an <span class="SpellE">Abao</span>, uncle of <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Subano</span>, relatives of <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of the fight, <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span>
who was the better boxer was able to knock down <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> fell, <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an <span class="SpellE">Abao</span> struck <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> on the back of his head with a piece of wood about 3
feet long causing him to fall to the ground, face downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a position, appellant <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> stood up and taking a piece of wood about 3 feet
long, the size of his wrist struck <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> on the right fore­head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he was followed by appel­lants <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span>, Ramon and <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> who
alternately hit <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span>
on his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Banagan</span>
used a piece of bamboo 2 1/2 feet long and about the size of his wrist and
Ramon and <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> used <span style="">a piece </span>of wood about 3 1/2 feet long the size of their
arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, Bay-<span class="SpellE">Abbu</span> arrived at the scene and immediately appellant <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span> struck him on
the forehead with a piece of bamboo causing him to fall to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Codalis</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span>, brother of <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> arrived and he was also struck by appellant <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The blow, however, was parried by <span class="SpellE">Codalis</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> and when he tried
to grab the piece of bamboo from <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>, the latter and his four com­panions
(co-appellants) ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then
that <span class="SpellE">Laydan</span> <span class="SpellE">Alimbac</span> who was
a spectator approached and helped <span class="SpellE">Codalis</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> lift <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> from the ground and brought him to the house of Abdul
Hosen <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> in a very serious con­dition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abdul Hosen <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>,
who was <span style="">a </span>barrio lieutenant,
inquired from <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span>
what happened and <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> answered that he had a fistic
fight with appellant <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>
and the latter's co-appellants, namely, <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an <span class="SpellE">Abao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> <span class="SpellE">Subano</span>
and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> struck him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abdul asked the cause of the fight and <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> related that he fought <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span>
when the latter got mad because he tried to collect the amount of P12 as his
indebtedness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abdul tried to give <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> some porridge but he was not able to take it as he <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span> blood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Concerned, Abdul tried to bring <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> to the
town proper of <span class="SpellE">Siocon</span> for medical treatment but <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> said that he could not endure the trip and that he
will die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact <span class="SpellE">Godo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> died at dawn of <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1959</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that before <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay's</span> cadaver was buried, <span style="">his </span>body was examined for wounds in the house of Abdul Hosen <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> by Provincial Sanitary Inspector David Z. <span class="SpellE">Alpuerto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Examination of the body disclosed that <span class="SpellE">Godo</span> <span class="SpellE">Idlay</span> suffered contusion at the right forehead; that the
skull behind the right ear was frac­tured; that there was contused wound
therein; that the neck was bruised and that the body was also bruised (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alpuerto</span> affirmed at the trial that a skull bone 7 inches
long and 2 1/2 inches wide protruded from the fractured skull; that the
contused wound in the fractured skull behind the right ear was 1 1/2 inches
deep; that there were bruises in the neck, on the breast and at the back of the
body."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the foregoing facts,
the Court of Appeals rendered </span><span style="">a </span>decision
<span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
<span style="">part of which is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, the judgment a quo <span style="">is </span>affirmed insofar as it concerns <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an
<span class="SpellE">Abao</span>, and otherwise modified as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) each of the four ap­pellants, <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lu­miguis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Su­bano</span>, <span style="">is </span>hereby
sentenced to suffer an indeterminate imprisonment of 3 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u>
to 11 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> </u><u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style="">; </span>and (2) all of the five appellants are hereby sentenced,

P6,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remainder of the judgment
a quo is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Subano</span></span><span style=""> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> withdrew his appeal, which withdrawal was approved
by resolution of this Court dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="10"><span style="">October 29, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an <span class="SpellE">Abao</span> did not appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners aver that the Court of Appeals erred (1) in
convicting the petitioners as accomplices in the crime of homicide, alleging
that <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span> and
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> should be convicted at <span style="">most </span>for physical injuries only and <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span> should be
acquitted; (2) in considering the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior
strength and in not considering the miti­gating circumstance of lack of
instruction and/or igno­rance in favor of the five accused-appellants, on the
assumption that the four-co-accused of <span class="SpellE">Abao</span> were
guilty as accomplices; and (3) in sentencing all the five accused-appellants,
jointly and severally, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of
P6,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> should
at most be convicted of physical in­juries and not as accomplices in the crime
of homicide, al­leging that the mortal blow was delivered by <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an <span class="SpellE">Abao</span>, the ones delivered
by <span class="SpellE">Banagan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span> and
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Subano</span> having merely caused bruises <span style="">on </span>different parts of the body of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also contend that <span class="SpellE">Kamba</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumiguis</span> should be
acquitted because the injuries sustained by him on ac­count of his quarrel with
the deceased, as shown by the medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
10), more than compensated for the blow delivered by him against the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contentions are devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an established fact that after <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an <span class="SpellE">Abao</span> had delivered the
mortal <span class="GramE">blow,</span> the petitioners followed attacking the
deceased with clubs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held
that infliction of wounds by a co-accused after the principal accused has
delivered the fatal blow shows actual participation in the criminal design and
such co-accused is guilty in the character of accomplice (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tumayao</span>, 56 Phil. 587; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Azcona</span>,
59 Phil. 580).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People vs. Cortes, et
al., 55 Phil. 143, we ruled: "Where the three accused attacked a third person,
one of them inflicting, with a club, a fatal blow on the forehead of the
victim, while the other two, immediately thereafter, inflicted minor injuries
with blows from similar weapons, a conviction of the first assailant in the
character of principal in homicide, and of the two companions in the character
of accomplices, is proper."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that the trial court erred in considering the
aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength and in not considering
the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction and/or ignorance, on the
assumption that the petitioners are guilty as accomplices.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The claim is tenable
insofar </span>as <span style="">the aggra</span>vating
circumstance of abuse of superior strength is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have ruled:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The estimation of this cir­cumstance is
essentially inconsistent with the finding that only one of three accused is
guilty in the character of principal, while the other two participated in the
character of accomplices only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the
abuse of superior strength is to be estimated as an aggravating circumstance
from the mere fact that more than one person participated in the offense, it
must appear that the accused cooperated together in some way designed to weaken
the defense; and if, in the case before us, the two accomplices really par­ticipated
in the sense necessary to enable the court to estimate against them the
aggravating circumstance men­tioned, this would make them guilty in the
character of principals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the court
having found that only one of the three was a principal and the other two did
not cooperate in the way necessary to make them principals, it is evi­dent that
the single principal cannot be said to have taken advantage of superior
strength; nor can said aggravating circumstance be estimated against the
accomplices" (People vs. Cortes, supra).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction and/or ignorance, petitioners
invoke Section 106 of the Administrative Code of the Department of Mindanao and
<span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, which we quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 106.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Sentences upon <span class="SpellE">Moros</span> and non-Christians.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In pronouncing sentence upon a Moro or
other non-Christian inhabitants of the Department convicted of crime or
misdemeanor, the judge or justice may ignore any minimum penalty provided by
law for the offense; and may impose such penalty not in excess of the highest
penalty provided by law, as, in his opinion, after taking into consideration
all the circumstances of the case, including the state of en­lightenment of the
accused and the degree of moral turpitude which attaches to the offense among
his own people, will best sub served the interest of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge or justice may also, in his dis­cretion
at any time before the expira­tion of the period allowed for appeal, suspend
the execution of any penalty or part thereof so imposed, subject to such <span style="">condition as he may prescribe."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the imposition of penalty on a non-Christian inhabitant, it is
within the discretion of the trial court to apply the special provision
above-quoted (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pawin</span>, 85 Phil. 528; People
vs. Salazar, 56 O. G. 6334).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
discretion should not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of abuse thereof,
and we are of the opinion that no such abuse was committed here.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly petitioners claim that the civil liability for which they
are bound to answer should be based on the extent of their actual
participation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim is tenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 110 of the Revised Penal Code provides that
"notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding article, the principals,
accomplices, <span style="">and accessories, each
within their respective class, shall be liable severally (in <span class="SpellE">solidum</span>) among themselves for their quotas, and <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> for those of the other persons liable."
It has been held that the sole principal in the commission of the offense of
homicide or murder is pri­marily liable for his own part of the indemnity and <span class="SpellE">sub­sidiarily</span> liable for the portion adjudged against his
ac­complices, in case of their insolvency; while the several accomplices are
jointly and severally liable for the por­tion adjudged against them and <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable for the portion of their principal, in
case of his insolvency (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bantagan</span>, 54 Phil.
834; People vs. Cortes, 55 Phil. 143).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the penalty to be imposed upon the petitioners,
Article 52 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the penalty next lower in
degree than that prescribed <span style="">by </span>law
for the consummated felony shall be imposed upon the accomplices, which in this
case is <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the non-attendance of any
mitigating or aggravating circumstance, and applying the Indeterminate Sentence
Law, the minimum range of the indeterminate penalty imposable upon each of the
three petitioners is from 6 months and 1 day to 6 years, and the maximum range
thereof is from 8 years and 1 day to 10 years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the foregoing
considerations</span>, the judgment appealed from is modified with respect to
the penalty, by reducing the maximum imposed by the Court of Appeals from <span style="">eleven </span>(11) years to ten (10) years of
<span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor; and with respect to the civil
liability, by apportioning the indemnity of P6,000.00 awarded by the Court of
Appeals as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the principal, <span class="SpellE">Dungo</span>-an <span class="SpellE">Abao</span>, shall be liable
primarily for P3,000.00; and the four petitioners herein, including <span class="SpellE">Sedinan</span> <span class="SpellE">Subano</span>, shall be liable
primarily and in <span class="SpellE">solidum</span> among themselves for
P3,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsidiary liability of
all of them shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of Article 110
of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement
of costs in this instance.</p>
