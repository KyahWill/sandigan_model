				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This case is before us on
regular appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila
dismissing the complaint in its </span><span style="">civil
</span><span style="">case No. 53067.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The plaintiffs, numbering
thirty-three (33) in all, instituted this action for "Specific Performance
and Damages," alleging four (4) causes of action against J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. Inc., and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
Inc., the latter in its capacity as managing partner and attorney-in-fact of
the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first cause of action
the complaint states that the plaintiffs are in possession of certain
residential lots situated in <span class="SpellE">Matalahib</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, having
purchased the same sometime in 1949 from several persons collectively
designated as the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>; that said lots are all
embraced and included in a bigger parcel of land covered by a Torrens title in
the name of </span><span style="">J.M. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tuason</span></span><span style=""> &amp; Co. Inc.; that after 1949 the same
lots claimed by herein plaintiffs became the subject-matter of several </span><span style="">civil cases in </span><span style="">the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City) between the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> and J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> Co.,
Inc.; that on March 16, 1953 the parties in those </span><span style="">cases </span><span style="">entered into a compromise agreement, subsequently embodied in the
decision of the Court, under which the legitimate purchasers of lots from the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, named in a list attached to the said agreement,
among them the plaintiffs, "who are to continue and/or who are entitled to
elect and have elected to buy their respective lots from the legal owners who
are now the defendants (J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. Inc.)
shall be credited (the) sums already paid by them under their former purchase
contracts from their respective predecessors-in-interest;" that it is
likewise provided in the compromise agreement that the so-called owners (J. </span><span style="">M. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tuason</span></span><span style=""> &amp; Co. Inc.), now the defendants, shall make new purchase contracts
in favor of the plaintiffs with respect to their respective lots acquired by
them </span><span style="">from the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Deudors</span></span><span style=""> at the current rate then existing at the
time </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the execution of the compromise agreement;
that the plaintiffs "are...willing to buy their respective </span><span style="">lots </span><span style="">and/or elect to continue to purchase the same from the defendants and
also to sign new purchase contracts, but the defendants without any legal
justifi­cation whatsoever, deliberately refused and failed and still refuse and
fail to make new purchase contracts in favor of the herein plaintiffs up to the
present time, notwithstanding verbal and written demands made by the plaintiffs
to the defendants, and in spite of their written and verbal commitments to
plaintiffs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The third and fourth
causes of action, after in­corporating by reference the allegations in the
first one, merely deal with the prices at which, according to the plaintiffs,
the defendants should sell the lots to them </span><span style="">pursuant to the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">The fourth cause of
action contains a claim for damages and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The relief sought in the
complaint, aside from the claim for damages and attorney's fees, is for the
defendants to be </span><span style="">ordered
"to </span><span style="">make new purchase
contracts in favor of the plaintiffs on their respective lots at the current
price ranging from P17.00 to P20.00 (per square meter) at the time of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">execution of the compromise agreement."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">J. M. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tuason</span></span><span style=""> &amp; </span><span style="">Co. Inc., and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc.</span></span><span style=""> filed separate motions to dismiss, both
pleading </span><span style="">im</span><span style="">proper venue and failure to state a cause of
action, and the first alleging, besides, extinctive prescription and <span class="SpellE">misjoinder</span> of parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Over the plaintiffs' opposition, the lower court granted the motion and
dismissed </span><span style="">the complaint </span><span style="">on one ground alone, namely, failure to state
a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The material portions
of the order of dismissal read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> compromise agreement upon which the plaintiffs based
their com­plaint had already been rescinded and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the rendition of the decision which was
based upon the compromise agree­ment, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> several incidents arose in <span style="">connection </span>with the implementation thereof <span class="GramE">which
led to the issuance of two orders by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
Branch, in </span>Civil <span style="">Cases Nos.</span></span><span style=""> <span class="GramE">Q-135, Q-139, Q-174 and
Q-177.</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the first order which was dated February 28, 1957, said
court directed those referred collectively as the ‘<span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>’
in the <span style="">compromise agreement, </span>to <span style="">clear and </span><span style="">deliver the peaceful possession of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">30 '<span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>' to </span><span style="">J. M. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tuason</span></span><span style=""> &amp; Co., Inc., and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc.
within a period of four (4) months from that date.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The ‘<span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>’ moved for the
reconsideration of said order while Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Inc. filed a motion alleging that the former had not delivered the 30 '<span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>' despite the expiration of four months fixed in
the order of February 28, 1957 and praying that the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City be directed to place <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
in possession of said parcel of land ex­cept those portions which were in the
possession of parties named individual­ly in said motion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch, denied the motion for
reconsideration of the '<span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>' and granted the
motion of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc. dated August 16,
1957 in an order dated January 10, 1958, wherein it made the following pro­nouncement:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> There is no excuse, therefore, for
the failure of the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> to deliver the remaining
30 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>, 4 years and <span style="">8 </span>months after the <span style="">execution and approval of the compromise
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The equit­able, if not the
legal, solution of the problem is the setting aside of the compromise agreement
of March 16, 1953, so far </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">it
still remains unim­plemented or <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure to deliver and the con­tinued
mushrooming of houses in the area, despite the compromise, justify the release
of J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc. from further obligations under </span><span style="">the agreement of </span><st1:date year="1953" day="16" month="3"><span style="">March 16, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the orders of February 28, <span style="">1957 and January 10, 1958, the '<span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>' </span>appealed
to the Supreme Court, but on May 30, 1961 it affirmed them and held among
others the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> In any event, said paragraph is
but <span style="">a faith</span>ful
statement of the law per­tinent to the subject, in<span style="">asmuch as the period of four (4) months, given </span>to <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>, </span>in
said decision, for the delivery of the land of 30 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>
to which their right to collect P614<span class="GramE">,925.74</span> was
subject <span style="">as a
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">suspensive</span></span><span style=""> condition - </span>constituted a <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the same expired with said <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span>
condition still unfulfilled, appellants' right to <span style="">comply with it was extinguished, and the conditional obligation of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to pay said sum was terminated </span>(Article
1193, <span style="">Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, et al. vs. J.
M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., G. R. L-13768, May 30,
1961)'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Whatever </span>doubt
there could still be as to the effect of <span style="">the
</span>ruling in the above-quoted case on the <span style="">compromise </span>agreement of <span style="">March </span>16, 1953, was dispelled by a sub­sequent
decision of the Supreme Court in ‘<span style="">J. M.
<span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bien­venido</span> <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>’, G. R.
L-16886, pro</span><span style="">mulgated on January
30, 1962 when </span><span style="">it stated </span><span style="">that – <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It is also <span style="">worthy </span>of
<span style="">note that the </span><span style="">compromise </span>between <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> upon which <span class="SpellE">Sanvictores</span>
predicates his right to buy the lot he occupies, has been validly rescinded and
set aside, as recognized by this Court in its decision in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-13768, <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>,
promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 30, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.’</span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court is of the opinion and so holds that the
complaint states no cause of action and by virtue thereof is hereby dismissed
without pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The plaintiffs moved to
reconsider, were turned down, and came up directly to this Court on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a well-settled rule
that in a motion to dismiss based on the ground that the complaint fails to
state a cause of <span class="GramE">action,</span> the question submitted to the
court for determination is the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether those allegations are
true or not is beside the point, for their truth is hypothetically admitted by
the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue rather is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>admitting them to be true, may the court render
a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer in the complaint?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated other­wise, the insufficiency of the
cause of action </span>must <span style="">appear on
the face of the complaint in order to sustain a dismissal on this ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No extraneous matter may be considered, nor
facts not alleged, <span class="GramE">which,</span> would require evidence and
therefore must be raised as defenses and await the trial (Garcon </span>vs. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Redemptorist</span></span><span style=""> Fathers, L-23510, May 30, 1966).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So rigid is the norm prescribed that if the
court should doubt the truth of the facts averred it must not dismiss the com­plaint
but require an answer and proceed to hear the case on the merits (Republic Bank
vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>, L-22399, March 30, 1967).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In departing from this
rule and taking cognizance of facts not alleged or referred to in the
complaint, speci­fically the so-called rescission of the compromise agree­ment
on which the plaintiffs' complaint is predicated, the lower court committed an
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged rescission the extent
of its effects on the different aspects of that agreement and specifically on
the present claims of the plaintiffs, are matters of defense which should be
properly raised in the answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
unsafe to lift the idea of "rescission" from the context in which it
was used in the two cases relied upon by the lower court and apply it here
without a previous inquiry into the facts to determine whether or not it is
indeed applicable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their brief the
defendants as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> insist on the other ground
alleged by them below in support of their motion to dismiss but not passed upon
by the lower court, namely, that venue was improperly laid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the allegations as well as the prayer in
the complaint </span><span style="">show </span><span style="">that this is not a
real but a personal action - to compel the defendants to execute the
corresponding purchase contracts in favor of the plaintiffs and to pay
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs do not claim
ownership of the lots in question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they
recognize the title of </span>the defendant J. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>,
Inc. They do not ask that possession be delivered to them, for they allege to
be in possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case cited by the
defendants (<span class="SpellE">Abao</span> et al. vs. J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc., G. R. L-16796, Jan. 30, 1962) is therefore not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, as stated by this Court in its
deci­sion, the "plaintiffs' action is predicated on the theory that they
are occupants, landholders", and 'most' of them ‘<span style="">owners by purchase’ of the residential lots in question; that, in
consequence of the compromise agreement adverted to above, between the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> and defendant corporations, the latter had
acknowledged the right and title of the </span><span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>
in and to <span style="">said </span>lots; and hence,
the right and title of the plaintiffs, as successors-in-interest of the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>; that, by entering into said agreement, defendant
corporations had, also, waived their right to invoke the indefeasibility of the
Torrens title in favor of J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co.,
Inc.; and that defendants have no right, therefore, to oust plain­tiffs from
the lots respectively occupied by them and which they claim to be entitled to
hold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, this action affects,
therefore, not only the possession of real property, but, also, the title
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it should have
been instituted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in which said property <span style="">is </span>situated (Section 3, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court)".</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, the order appealed from </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings, with costs
against the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in this instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
