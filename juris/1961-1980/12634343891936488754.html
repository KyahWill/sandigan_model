<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="11">November
 7, 1978</st1:date>, petitioner, thru the Office of the Solicitor General,
filed a notice of appeal<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
signifying his intention to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and alleging that
"having been sued in his official capacity, is exempt from filing the
appeal bond."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1978</st1:date>,
respondent Judge issued an order,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The intended appeal by respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Calimlim</span>,
will not be given due course unless he files an appeal bond within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His being sued in his official capacity does not exempt him from the
filing of an appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the
government of the Republic of the Philippines is exempt from the filing of an
appeal bond since under Section 1 of Rule 142, the govern­ment of the Republic
of the Philippines is not liable for costs, unless the law so provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Government of the Philippines vs. The Judge
of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, 34 Phil. 157; <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
&amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. vs. Rafferty, 39 Phil. 145).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Rules of Court does not exempt a public official sued in
his official capacity from paying the required appeal bond especially as in
this case where respondent was made liable for damages in his private capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner moved for reconsideration;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
however, the same was denied by respondent Judge in his order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1979</st1:date>, with a warning that
unless the appeal bond was filed within five (5) days from receipt of the
order, he would issue a writ of execution as prayed by private respondent in
his motion for execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the petitioner, thru the Solicitor General, interposed the
present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As prayed for by the petitioner, this Court issued on <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1979</st1:date> a temporary
restraining order "effective as of this date and continuing until
otherwise ordered by the Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue to be resolved in the instant case is whether or
not the petitioner is legally required to file an appeal bond for the
perfection of his appeal from the deci­sion of respondent Judge in Civil Case
No. 2728 - a special civil action for <i>mandamus</i> with damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General contends that since the petitioner was sued
in his official capacity as Regional Director of the Bureau of Lands, then it
was not required of him to file an appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only the notice of appeal was necessary for the perfection of his
appeal, and in support thereof cited the cases of <u>Commissioner of
Immigration vs. Romero</u><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and <u>Embroidery and Apparel Control and Inspection Board vs. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span></u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exemption from the filing of an appeal
bond applies only in cases where the action is brought by or against public
officers <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> merely as nominal representatives
of the Government and sued purely in their official capacity,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
as in the cases cited by the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, when a public officer is sued not only in his official capacity
but also in his personal capacity, he is not exempted from the filing of an
appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tabuena</u></span><u> vs. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which is also a case of <i>mandamus</i> with damages, this Court rejected the
claim of the respondent Director of the Forest Research Institute that he was
exempted from the filing of an appeal bond in the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"We find this conclusion untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general rule is that an appeal bond is
required for the purpose of paying for the costs which the appellate court may
award against the appellant (Sec. 5, Rule 41).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As an exception, an appeal bond is not required of the Government when
it is the unsuccessful party, because no costs are supposed to accrue against
the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
unless otherwise provided by law (Sec. 1, Rule 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But exemption from the filing of bonds
applies only where the action is brought by or against public officers <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> merely as nominal representatives of the Government,
and sued purely in their official capacity (<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
vs. Carlos, 66 Phil. 140; Chan vs. Villanueva, et al., L-5420, April, 1952; <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>, et
al., L-8895 &amp; L-9191, April 30, 1957; <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
&amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. v. Raf­ferty, 39 Phil. 145; <span class="SpellE">Gov't</span>.
of PI vs. Judge of the Court of First Instance, 34 Phil. 157).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears exceedingly clear in this case that respondent De
la Cruz was sued not only in his official capacity as Director of the Forest
Research Institute, but also in his personal capacity for having acted
allegedly in manifest bad faith, 'with the purpose of persecuting,
discriminating against or committing injustice to the petitioner' (par. 13,
Ann. "F"); and accordingly, the judgment of the court of origin made
him personally liable for damages in varying concepts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the trial court committed
error in awarding damages against De la Cruz in his personal capacity is
immaterial here, this being more properly cognizable in an appeal from the main
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For our purpose, what is decisive
is the dual character in which he was sued and the judgment rendered by the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least on principle, a
public officer, by virtue of his office alone, is not immune from damages in
his personal capacity arising from illegal acts done in bad faith (Art. 27,
N.C.C.; 43 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., 86, 89-90).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A different rule would sanction the use of
public office as a tool of oppression."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the herein petitioner – like the respondent
public officer in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Tabuena</u></span> case – was sued
not only in his official capacity as Regional Director, Region V of the Bureau
of Lands, but also in his personal capacity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in his petition below, the private respondent Jaime <span class="SpellE">Alegre</span> alleged that the actuations of the petitioner Pedro <span class="SpellE">Calimlim</span> in depriving him of his right to assume his
position as Hearing Officer I, subjected him to ridicule, humiliation and
embarrassment, and as such, he suffered moral and consequential damages, and,
accordingly, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in its decision made him personally
liable for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, We
hold that petitioner Pedro <span class="SpellE">Calimlim</span> is not exempted
from the filing of an appeal bond to perfect his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the instant petition should be, as it is
hereby, DISMISSED, and the peti­tioner is hereby given a period of ten (10)
days from entry of our judgment within which to file his appeal bond in Civil
Case No. 2728, and thereafter, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> shall conduct
further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order heretofore issued is
hereby dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, J., <span style="font-style: normal;">concurs, but were it not because the Solicitor General had agreed with
petitioner as to his right to exemption from filing an appeal bond, he would
have voted to declare the judgment of the trial court final.</span><b><o:p></o:p></b></span><br>
