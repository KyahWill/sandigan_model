				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The Manila Surety &amp;
Fidelity Company, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> filed </span>this petition for
review by certiorari of the decision of the Court of Appeals in its Case No. <span class="GramE">CA-G.</span> <span class="GramE">R. No. 30916.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case relates to the execution of a joint
and several judgment for money obtained by the said company against the
Philippine Ready-Mix Concrete Co., Inc. and Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>,
Jr., in a litigation started <span style="">in </span>1952
in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 17014), whose decision
was affirmed by the Court of Appeals with only a slight modification in respect
of the award for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The proceedings which
took place thereafter are narrated in the decision sought to be reviewed as <span class="GramE">follows</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When said decision became final, respondent Manila Surety
secured on September 20, 1961, from the Court of First Instance of Manila in
Civil Case No. 17014 a second alias writ of execution addressed to respondent
provin­cial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> whose deputy, together
with counsel for respondent Manila Surety, repaired to the re­sidence of herein
petitioner at No. 794 Harvard Street, <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and levied upon a car, some furniture, appliances
and personal properties found therein belonging solely and exclusive­ly to the
petitioner with the exception of a sewing machine which belonged to a maid by
the name of <span class="SpellE">Nati</span> Fresco, a G.E. television set which
was the pro­perty of the minor Jose Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>,
and a baby grand piano as well as a Columbia radio phonograph <span style="">which </span>belonged to Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
the petitioner was then abroad, her sister Josefina <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,
to <span style="">whom </span>she had entrusted the
custody and safekeeping of the properties, had made representations to the
deputy sheriff and to the counsel of respondent Manila Surety regarding the
ownership of the petitioner over certain personal effects levied upon, but they
ignored the same and proceeded with the levy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, respondents caused the posting at several places notices of
sale, preparatory to disposing peti­tioner's properties at public auction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To stay the sale at public auction of petitioner's properties, she
filed on <u>November 3, 1961</u>, with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a complaint with injunction, entitled 'Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> vs. Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc. and the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>', praying among other
things for damages and a writ of preliminary injunction which was accordingly
issued upon peti­tioner's filing of a bond in the sum <span style="">of P30,000.00 enjoining the pro­vincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
from selling at public auction the properties claimed by said petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>However, on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="11"><u>November 9,
 1961</u></st1:date>, respondent Manila Surety filed an 'Omnibus Motion to
Dismiss the Com­plaint and to <span class="GramE">Dissolve</span> Injunction' to
which an opposition was filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the parties had adduced their evidence in support of their
respective claims and after hearing their arguments, the lower court declared
that the properties in question are community pro­perties of Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> (herein petitioner) and Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>,
Jr., dis­solved on <u>May 12, 1962</u>, the writ of preliminary injunction it
had issued and dismissed the complaint (Civil case No. 6865, CFI-<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Not satisfied, Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> (as
plaintiff in said civil case No. 6865 of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>)
interposed an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meanwhile,
however, the Manila Surety filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="5"><u>May
 29, 1962</u></st1:date>, in the Court of First Instance of Manila a motion for
the issuance of a third alias writ of execution for the satisfaction of the
judgment debt in civil case No. 17014.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting upon said motion the Court of First Instance of Manila issued on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="6"><u>June 2, 1962</u></st1:date>, the 'Third Alias
Writ of Execution.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, on <u>June 7, 1962</u>, deputies of the provincial sheriff of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> again repaired to the residence of herein pe­titioner
at No. 794 Harvard St., <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, and levied upon
the same pro­perties, with the exception of the baby grand piano and the
'Columbia' phono­graph which were the properties of Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>,
Jr. and which had already been sold at public auction November 6, 1961 for
P3,305.00, the Regal sewing machine owned by <span class="SpellE">Nati</span>
Fresco, the beds found in the boy's and girl's rooms, a marble dining table <span style="">and chairs, a stereophonic phono­graph and
the G.E. television set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on the
following day, </span><st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="6"><span style="">June 8, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> advertised the sale at public auction of the
aforementioned properties claimed by herein petitioner, setting the date thereof
for </span><st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="6"><u><span style="">June 16, 1962</span></u></st1:date><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> thereupon filed an original petition for injunction
in the Court of Appeals to stop the scheduled sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="10"><span style="">October 24, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the said Court rendered the deci­sion now
under review, granting the writ prayed for and permanently enjoining respondent
provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> from selling at public
auction the properties in question for the satisfaction of the judgment debt of
Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>, Jr.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>case <span style="">for herein petitioner rests on the pro­position
that the said properties, claimed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
to be hers exclusively, pertain to the co-ownership established between her and
Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>, Jr., pursuant to Article 144 of the
Civil Code, and consequently may be levied upon on execution for the
satisfaction of the latter's judgment debt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts relied upon in support of this theory of co-ownership are
stated in the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
quoted by the Court of Appeals, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>, Jr. and Sonia <span class="SpellE">Lizares</span> were married in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1935" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1935</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1954" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1954</st1:date>, a decree of divorce was granted by the Court of the State
of <st1:state><st1:place>Nevada</st1:place></st1:state> dissolving the bonds of
matrimony between Sonia <span class="SpellE">Lizares</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Coro<span style="">minas</span></span>,
Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> met Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>, Jr. in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> on <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> On <st1:date year="1956" day="26" month="3">March 26,

 <st1:state>Nevada</st1:state>, <st1:country-region>U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Additional pertinent facts, also mentioned in the decision under
review and not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the parties, are that
Sonia <span class="SpellE">Lizares</span> is still living and that the conjugal
partnership formed by her marriage to <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span> was
dissolved by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Manila upon their
joint petition, the decree of dissolution having been issued on <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1957</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue here is the applicability of Article 144 of
the Civil Code to the situation thus created.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Article provides:</p>

<blockquote>"When a man and a woman live together as husband and wife, but
they are not married, or their marriage is void from the beginning, the
property acquired by either or both of them through their work or industry or
their wages and salaries shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that the decree of divorce granted by the Court
of Nevada in 1954 is not valid under Philippine law, which has outlawed divorce
altogether; that the matri­monial bonds between Jose <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>,
Jr. and Sonia <span class="SpellE">Lizares</span> have not been dissolved,
although their conjugal partnership was terminated in 1957; and that the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> subsequent marriage in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
to Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> is bigamous and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">While Article 144 speaks, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
of a void marriage without any qualification, the Court of Appeals declined to
apply it in this case on two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the subsisting marriage of <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span> to
Sonia <span class="SpellE">Lizares</span> constitutes an impediment to a valid
marriage between him and respondent Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,
which impediment, according to a number of decisions of the Supreme Court,
precludes the establishment of a co-ownership under said article, and (2) the
funds used by said respondent in acquiring the properties in question were
"fruits of her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> investments which
accrued before her marriage to <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The decisions cited under the first ground are Christensen vs.
Garcia, 56 O.G. No. 16, p. 3199, Samson v. <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>,
56 O.G. No. 11, p. 2401; and <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> vs. Rodriguez, 54
O.G. No. 20, p. 5526.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a proper case,
where it may be necessary to do so in order to resolve an unavoidable issue,
the precise scope of the "no impediment to a valid marriage" dictum in
said decisions will undoubtedly deserve closer examination, since it
establishes an exception to the broad terms of Article 144.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, a situation may arise
involving a conflict of rights between a co-ownership under that provision and
an existing conjugal partnership formed by a prior marriage where, for
instance, the husband in such marriage lives with another woman and with his
salary or wages acquires properties during the extra-marital cohabitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A ruling would then be in order to determine
which - as be­tween the co-ownership and the conjugal partnership - could claim
ascendancy insofar as the properties are concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, however, we find no need to pass on this
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The particular properties
involved here, which were admittedly acquired <span style="">by </span>respondent <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, cannot be
deemed to belong to such co-ownership because, as found by the trial court and
confirmed by the Court of Appeals, the funds used in acquiring said properties
were fruits of respondent's <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> investments
which accrued before her "marriage" to <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words they were not acquired <span style="">by </span>either or both of the partners in
the void marriage through their work or industry or their wages and salaries,
and hence cannot be the subject of co-ownership under Article 144.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They remain respondent's exclusive
properties, beyond the reach of execution to satisfy the judg­ment debt of <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several procedural questions have been raised <span style="">by </span>petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, that the injunction issued by the
Court of appeals was improper since it was not in aid of its appel­late
jurisdiction; second, that respondent Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
having elected to appeal from the decision of the Court of <span style="">First </span>Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
she may not pursue the remedy of injunction as she did in this case; third, that
respondent's petition for injunction in the Court of Appeals failed to state a
cause of action; fourth, that the proper remedy avail­able to respondent was by
filing a third-party claim; and finally, that the trial judge should have been
included as party respondent in the petition for injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the first and second points, the tact is that respondent
Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> perfected her appeal to the Court of
Appeals, which found that there were questions of fact involved therein, one of
them being whether the properties in question were acquired before or after her
void marriage to <span class="SpellE">Corominas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In aid of its appellate jurisdiction, there­fore,
the said Court could issue a writ of injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, what happened here was that before
the record on appeal could be filed (on June 18, 1962) or approved (on
September 8, 1962) a third alias writ of execution was issued by the trial
court (on June 2, 1962) and the properties in question were again levied upon
by the sheriff and advertised for sale on June 16, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was impracticable for respondent to first
wait for the appeal to be elevated to and docketed in the Court of Appeals and
then <span class="GramE">secure</span> the ancillary remedy of injunction
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An independent petition for
injunction, under the circumstances, was not unjustified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent could, indeed, have filed a third party claim instead
as indicated in <span style="">Rule </span>39, Section
15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then her sister Josefina <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> did make such a claim in her behalf after the
second alias writ of execution was issued, but it was ignored and the sheriff
proceeded with the levy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, a
third party claim is not an exclusive remedy:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the same rule provides that nothing therein contained "shall
prevent such third person from vindicating his claim to the property by any
proper action."</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not deem it to be a reversible error for Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> not to include the trial Judge as party-respondent
in her petition for injunction in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Judge would have been merely <span style="">a </span>nominal party anyway, and no
substantial rights of petitioner here have been prejudiced by the omission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of the foregoing</b>, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is affirmed, with costs.</p>
