				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner comes before this Court praying for the review, by way
of appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, of the decision dated February 21, 1974 and the
resolution dated March 27, 1974 of the Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
pursuant to Section 17, par. 4 of the Judiciary Act, as amended by Republic <span class="SpellE">Act.No</span>. 5440.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned decision of respondent Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
discloses the following undisputed facts:</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff was an employee of the defendant Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Company from October 1927 to July 31, 1963,
except for the years 1942 to 1944 of the Japanese Occupation, or for a net
period of 33 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of his
separation from the employ of the defendant, the plaintiff held the position of
Chief Accountant with a monthly salary of P900.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 23, 1963, a Labor Agreement was entered into between the
defendant and the Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Employees
Association (LTBEA) providing, among others, for a retirement plan for the
employees of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plain­tiff
was a member of the Special Bargaining Committee of the LTBEA which negotiated
the agreement in or about August, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among the provisions of the retirement plan was the com­pulsory
retirement of an employee upon reaching the age of sixty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On June 27, 1963, the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff
notifying him, among other things, that the plaintiff will be retired from the
service effective July 31, 1963 on which date the plaintiff shall have reached
the age of sixty years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The plaintiff replied to the said letter on the same date,
requesting that he be allowed to continue in the service until he shall have
reached the age of sixty-five.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The request was denied in a letter of the defendant dated July 8,
1963.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In due course, the plaintiff was retired from the employ of the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His retirement pay was
computed according to the retirement plan under which he was entitled to
receive the sum of P7,139.54.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
deducting the sums that the plaintiff owed the defendant, the plaintiff
actually received a net retirement pay of P6,743.08 for which the plaintiff
signed the requisite clearance certificate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the bottom of the said clearance certificate appears a certification
that the plaintiff had been paid and received all the regular and overtime pay
for services rendered previous to and including the last day of service with
the company and that he had no other claim for non-payment or underpayment of
any wage due him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On February 2, 1966, the plaintiff, thr.0 Atty. Alberto <span class="SpellE">Villaraza</span>, made a formal demand on the defendant for the
payment of separation pay pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act 1787 in
the total sum of P16,200.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim
was denied in a letter of defendant's counsel dated February 17, 1966 on the
ground that the employment of the plaintiff with the defendant was for a
definite period; moreover, it was claimed that the termination of plaintiff's
employment upon reaching sixty years of age was a "just cause" within
the contemplation of Section 1 (f) of Republic Act 1787.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 6, 1966, the plaintiff commenced his action before the Court
of First Instance of Laguna, Branch III in San Pablo City, praying for the
recovery of the difference between <span style="">P14,850.00,
the termination pay equivalent to 33 years of service at P900.00 a month and
the sum of p6,743.08 which the plaintiff had received from the latter's employ.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>After the parties submitted a Stipulation of Facts, the trial court
rendered judgment dismissing the complaint with costs against the
plaintiff."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
56-60)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon the appeal of herein private respon­dent Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span>, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment thereon
ruling adversely against herein petitioner company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of said decision reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATION, the judgment appealed
from is hereby reversed and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In lieu thereof, another one is rendered ordering the defendant to pay
the plaintiff the sum of P7,710.46 with interest at the legal rate from April
6, 1966 until full payment, plus the further sum of P2,000.00 for and as
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant shall pay
the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>this petition
for review, petitioner company seeks the setting aside of the decision of
respondent <span style="">Court of Appeals and the
rendition of a judgment dis­missing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Likewise, <span style="">it prays that it be absolved from any liability to private respondent
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> or his heirs.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fundamental issue in this controversy is whether or not
respondent Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> is entitled to
separation pay provided for in Republic Act No. 1787 (Termination Pay Law), or
to retirement pay provided for in the rider to the labor agreement between
petitioner Company and the Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus
Employees Associa­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the employment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> was for a definite period and hence, does not come
within the purview of Republic Act No. 1787, and that the termination of
respondent's employment upon reaching sixty years of age was a "just
cause" within the contemplation of Section 1 (f) of Republic Act
1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also maintains that the
action of respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> <span style="">in </span>becoming a member of the Special Bargaining Committee that
negotiated the labor agreement for compulsory retirement upon <span style="">reaching sixty years of age militates against
such claim for separation coverage under Republic Act 1787.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's contentions
are untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that
at the time respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> com­menced working
for petitioner company in 1927, his employment was for an indefinite period
which status continued until Republic Act 1787 was approved on June 21, 1957,
Did the approval of the rider to the Labor Agreement in 1963 setting the
retirement age at sixty years change the status of respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span>' employment?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This question is answered squarely by Section 2 of the Termination Pay
Law or Republic Act 1787 which provides thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Any contract or agreement contrary to the provisions of
section one of this Act shall be null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, That nothing herein contained shall
prevent an employer and his employees or their representatives to enter into a
collective bargaining agreement with terms <u><span style="">more liberal</span></u><span style=""> than
those provided for in this Act <u>in favor of the employees</u>."
(Underscoring supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering that under
the Labor Agreement, the respondent received P7,139.54 whereas under Republic
Act 1787 (the Termination Pay Law) he. would receive Y14,850.00, it stands to
reason that the Termination Pay Law is more favorable to respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> than under the Labor Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the Labor Agree­ment was less
liberal to </span>respondent <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Hinagpis</span></span><span style=""> than
under the Termination Pay Law and should not prejudice him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would obviously defeat the very purpose of
Republic Act 1787 which this Court speaking thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Sanchez in </span><u><span style="">Insular Lumber Co.
v. Court of Appeals, et </span></u><u><span style="">al</span></u><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> said should be interpreted with the aim in
view of advancing the magnificent purpose thereof to give justifiable
protection to laborers so dismissed and their families.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There are, indeed,
provisions in the Labor Agreement relied upon by respondent Court of Appeals in
reversal of the trial court's decision, such as Article </span>XVII <span style="">of the Agreement which specifically provided
that "all existing privileges presently enjoyed by the employees but which
have not been included in this Agreement shall continue to be enjoyed by the
employees." This is reiterated and reinforced in Article XVIII which
provides that "the parties hereby agree that all existing privileges
presently enjoyed by the employees shall be maintained and granted to the
employees." We agree with the respondent Court's declaration that the
petitioner's action of denying and depriving respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span>
of the privileges and benefits he was already enjoying under Republic Act 1787
at the time of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Labor Agreement
is tantamount to a betrayal of faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioner that the separa­tion of
respondent upon reaching the retirement age of sixty is a just cause for
terminating his employment even if the same were without a definite period, is
clearly inapplicable in petitioner's case for the reasons above stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent is, therefore, entitled to separation pay under
Republic Act 1787 equivalent to one-half month's salary for every year of
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent having served for 33
years in the company at the rate of p900.00 a month as chief accountant, he
should receive p450.00 multiplied by 33 years or 014,850.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After deducting the amount he actually
received as separation pay in the sum of P7,139.54, the difference of 07,710.46
is still due him under the said Republic Act 1787.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is further entitled to attorney's fees
having been compelled to litigate to enforce his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 2208, pars. (7) &amp; (8), New Civil
Code)</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Calma</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through now Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, held that
while it is the employer's legal right to terminate an employee's services at
any time with or without just cause, in the latter case, it is the company's
legal duty to serve on the employee the written notice required by Republic Act
1787 and otherwise, to accord him the separation pay due him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>,
who was separated without just cause and without the service of the required
notice was awarded one-half month for every year of service with legal interest
thereon from the filing of the complaint until the amount was fully paid <span style="">plus </span>attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Batangas</u></span><u>
Laguna <span class="SpellE">Taya­bas</span> Bus Co. v. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled that since the dismissal of therein private-respondent <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> de Mesa <span style="">was
</span>without cause, he was entitled under the law to one-half (1/2) month
salary for every year of service, so that for 31 years of service he was held
entitled to 15-1/2 months' salary or the amount of P19,957.56 as his separation
pay with legal interest from the filing of the complaint until fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these two cased above cited wherein this Court
applied Republic Act 1787 and awarded payment of attorney's fees and legal
interest to the claimants separated without termination pay from their
employment, We see no ground to disturb respondent Court's award of interests
and attorney's fees.</p>

Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MUÑOZ <st1:city><st1:place>PALMA</st1:place></st1:city>,
<i>J</i>.:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I agree that respondent Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span>
should receive, in addition to his retirement pay, the amount of P7, 710.46
representing the <u>difference</u> between the termination pay to which he
should have been entitled under the Termination Pay Law and the retirement pay
he received from the petitioner under their labor 'agreement, but not because
he was "wrongfully retired or illegally separated" from the service
of petitioner beginning July 31, 1963 as stated in the main Opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">see</span> p. 5)</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 1306 of the Civil Code the contracting parties - in
this particular case, the employer and the employees - are free to stipulate
such terms and conditions as they may deem convenient pro­vided these are not
contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has upheld the right of contracting parties to freely
stipulate for their mutual benefit and protection and has respected contracts
and agreements validly entered into between them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Philippine Education Co., Inc. vs. Court of Industrial
Relations and Union of Philippine Education Employees</u> (NLU), the Court,
speaking through Justice Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, had occasion
to state that "pension payments and retirement plans are embraced in
'wages' and conditions of employment, and are proper subjects of collective
bargaining," citing 12 A.L.R. 2d 274, 275 for American decisions adopting
this view, thus -</p>

<blockquote>"'Pension payments, together with a compul­sory retirement
plan, were held in Inland Steel Co. v. National Labor Relations Board (1948,
CA7th) 170 F 2d 247, 12 ALR2d 240, cent den 336 US 960, 93 L ed 1112, 69 S et
886, to be a matter as to which collective bargaining was required by the
National Labor Relations and the Labor-Management Relations Acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pension payments were held to be 'wages'
within the act, or at least to be included in 'conditions of employment', the
court pointing out that such plans were an inducement to the worker to accept
employment, and affected his financial status, forming a part of the
consideration for work performed as to which the employee would be entitled to
sue and recover upon the refusal of the company to pay benefits, so that such
payments could not be regarded as a mere gift, similar to voluntary payments
made on the marriage of an employee or at the birth of his child. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"'In the same case, age of compulsory retire­ment of employees
was held to be a condition of employment as to which the National Labor Rela­tions
Act and the Labor Management Relations Act required the employer to carry on
collective bargaining with the employees' representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> '" (94
Phil. 73, 80, 1953)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The freedom of the parties to stipulate is likewise recognized in
paragraph 3, Section 2 of the Termination Pay Law (R.A. No. 1052, as amended by
R.A. No. 178 7) which provides that nothing therein contained (in Section 1 of
the 1 aw) shall prevent an employer and his employees or their representatives
from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with terms <u>more liberal</u>
than those provided for in the law <u>in favor of the employees</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">A collective bargaining agreement once<span style=""> </span>successfully concluded between the parties becomes a
"labor contract" in the true sense of the term between two parties
and from thence on, <u>their rights shall be governed <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Francisco, Labor Laws in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
Annotated, Vol. I, Fourth Edition, p. 778) (Underline supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case on hand the parties were free to agree <span style="">on a retire­ment </span>plan providing for
the compulsory retirement age of 60 years and for the corresponding payment of
retirement <span style="">pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Such an agree­ment is perfectly valid
and may be allowed under the law to govern the rights of the parties
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, although retirement
is not one of the just causes for termination of employment enumerated in the
Termination Pay Law, I hold the view that the retirement of an employee under a
labor agreement is not a dismissal without just cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, should the benefits in favor of the employee under the
retirement plan of the labor agreement prove to be less liberal than those
provided for in the Termination Pay Law, the law should be made to apply to the
employee for it is the intent of the law <span style="">(as
ex­pressly </span>provided in Section 2, par. 3, thereof) not to deprive the
employee of certain benefits already existing in his favor at the time the
labor agreement was entered into.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, under the Termination Pay Law respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> would have been entitled to <u>16 months and 15 days</u>
advance notice before he could be separated from the service considering his 33
years of service with the petitioner; or, in lieu thereof, to the pay­ment of
separation pay in the amount of P14<span class="GramE">,850.00</span> based on
his monthly rate of P900.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose
of the law is "to cushion the adverse effects of sudden separation from
employment." (Insular <span style="">Lumber </span>Co.
vs. Court of Appeals, et al., L-23857, August 29, 1969 29 SCRA 371, 376, per
Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Sanchez)</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the retirement plan of the labor agreement which was
approved only on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1963</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> had only a period of <u>a little
over two (2) months</u> to prepare for the eventuality of his separation from
the service of petitioner due to his retirement on <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And his retirement pay <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> amounted to
only P7<span class="GramE">,139.54</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was due to this suddenness of the event of his retire­ment that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> requested petitioner to allow him
to continue in the service until he shall have reached 65 years of age.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear from the foregoing that the benefits to which
respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span> was entitled under the labor
agreement were <u>less</u> liberal than those under the Termination Pay Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as at the time of respondent <span class="SpellE">Hinagpis</span>'
retirement the record does not disclose any pending charge against him and had
it not been for the compulsory retirement age he would have continued in the
service of petitioner until given the proper notice of separation under the
law, and further considering the length of his service in the company, it is
but fair and just that this particular employee be granted the benefit of
separation pay at the same rate provided for dismissals without just cause.</p>
