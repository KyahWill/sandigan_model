				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal taken from the decision of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental in its Civil Case No. 5279,
dated September 3, 1964, dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs filed the complaint on <st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1959</st1:date> (amending it on May 30 following)
for recovery of possession of a parcel of land, plus damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the defendants filed their respective
answers the case was submitted for decision on the following stipulation of
facts:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the parties agree that the subject matter
of this case is lot No. 2498 of the <span class="SpellE">Cadastrel</span> Survey
of Escalante, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the said Lot No. 2498 of Escalante
Cadastre was originally registered in the name of Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> under Original Certificate of Title No. 228
of the land records of this province by virtue of a Homestead Patent No. 8854
issued on <st1:date year="1926" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1926</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on September 21, 1927, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, namely, Andres
<span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sabas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, Fabian <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">Ardiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, sold, conveyed and transferred the aforesaid Lot
No. 2498 of Escalante Cadastre unto Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>,
Sr. predecessor of plaintiffs, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>, Jr.,
by virtue of <span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Compra</span>
<span style="">y </span><span class="SpellE">Venta</span>
ratified and acknowledged before Notary Public, Maria L. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, as Doc. 117; page
No. 31, Book 1, Series of 1927;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That by virtue of the aforeÂ­mentioned <span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Compra</span> Y <span class="SpellE">Venta</span>, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>, Sr.,
during his lifetime and after his death his heir, Lorenzo Echarri, Jr., since
1927 up to the present had been in continuous, exclusive and open possession in
the concept of owner of said property;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That defendant, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Rasquin</span>
is lessee of said property from defendant, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>,
Jr., whose lease contract will terminate at the end of the crop year 1964-65
and the parties agree that said defendant be dropped <span style="">as a </span>party in the present case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Andres <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sabas</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, Fabian <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ardiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> who sold and conveyed the said property Lot No.
2498 in favor of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Echarri</span>, Sr., are the
children of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>
and his wife <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Onio</span>
and the plaintiffs herein with the exception of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ardiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> are the descendants of the deceased, Andres, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sabas</span></span><span style="">, </span>Fabian and <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing stipulation the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
upheld the defendants plea of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> on the part of <span style="">the p</span>laintiffs and consequently
dismissed the complaint, citing the decision of this Court in the case of Mejia
de Lucas vs. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>, 100 Phil. 277.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The propriety of the said defense is the only
issue here - as well, of course <span style="">as </span>the
applicability of the ruling in that decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find for the defendants on both counts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Mejia case the essential facts are
similar to those in the case before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
land there in dispute was <span style="">acquired </span>by
free patent issued in 1916 pursuant to Act No. 926.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days afterwards the patentee deeded the
land to another, who held possession thereof until his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1940 his successor transferred the land to
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>, from whom the plaintiff, a
grand-daughter of the patentee, sought to recover it after 37 years since the
original conveyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon <span style="">a </span>careful
consideration of the facts and circumstances, we are constrained to find, however,
that while no legal defense to the action lies, an equitable one lies in favor
of the defendant and that is, the equitable defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the defense of prescription or
adverse possession in derogation of the title of the registered owner Domingo
Mejia does not lie, but that of the equitable defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, we hold that while
defendant may not be considered <span style="">as </span>having
acquired title by virtue of his and his predecessor's long continued possession
for 37 years, the original owner's right to recover back the possession of the
property and the title thereto from the defendant has, by the long period of 37
years and by patentee's inaction and neglect, been converted into <span style="">a stale </span>demand."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellants stress the fact that the free patent acquired by
their predecessor in 1926 was not issued under Act No. 926 but under Act No.
2874, and that while under the former statute a sale of the land within the
prohibited period of seven (7) years was merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>,
<span style="">a sale </span>under the latter statute
within five (5) years from the issuance of the patent is absolutely null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not see that this difference
is at all material in regard to the question of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This defense is an equitable one and does not concern itself with
the character of the defendant's title, but only with whether or not by reason
of the plaintiff's long inaction or inexcusable neglect he should be barred
from asserting this claim at all, because to allow him to do so would be
inequitable and unjust to the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, Section 122 of Act No. 2874, which declares that a conveyance
within the prohibited period is null and void, makes no reference whatsoever to
any right of the patentee or his heirs to recover the property thus illegally
conveyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it provides is that such
conveyance "shall produce the effect of annulling and canceling the grant,
title, patent, or permit originally issued . . . and cause the reversion of the
property and its improvements to the government." In other words, the
plaintiffs cannot avail of the nullity of the conveyance as an excuse to avoid
the consequences of their own unjustified inaction and as a basis for the
assertion of a right on which they had slept for so long, especially since such
right is not expressly conferred by the law in the first place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Angeles et al., vs. Court of Appeals, 102 Phil. 1006, is invoked
by the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our decision in that
case, as well as its citation of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Perdido</span> et al., 97 Phil. 41, is not here applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those cases involved the question of
prescription, and specifically held that an action or defense for the
declaration of the nullity of a contract that is inexistent and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> does not
prescribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case before us does not
involve the statutory defense of prescription but the equitable doctrine <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, which we
find to be proper under the facts stipulated by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">judgment appealed from
is affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
