				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Criminal case No. 6923 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, 
defendants-appellee were charged with the offense of libel in an information 
filed by the Provincial Fiscal, the pertinent portion of which is as 
follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 7th day of May, 1956, in the municipality of Miagao, 
Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the 
said accused, with deliberate intent, conspiring together, confederating among 
themselves, and working and helping one another, with malicious intent and evil 
motive of attacking, injuring and impeaching the character, honesty integrity, 
virtue and reputation of one Jose J. Monteclaro, Second Assistant City Fiscal of 
the City of Iloilo, as a lawyer, as a professor of law, and as a private citizen 
of good standing and reputation in the community and with malicious intent of 
exposing the said Jose J. Monteclaro to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, 
discredit and dishonor, without any justifiable motive, did then and there 
willfully, maliciously and criminally prepare or cause to prepare, typewrite, 
sign and send a letter addressed to the President of the Philippines Ramon 
Magsaysay, wherein said letter the said accused did then and there defame and 
insult the undersigned Jose J. Monteclaro by branding and imputing upon the 
undersigned the follow-defamatory and libelous statements, to wit:</p>
<p>" 'However, Mr. President, one lamentable incident which happened to us was 
the Illegal and oppressive acts of one Jose J. Monteclaro, City Fiscal of Iloilo 
and his brother Agustin Monteclaro, Toll-keeper of Miagao, Bridge Iloilo, who 
because of the powers of their respective offices and their influence, over 
other public officials and other persons, they are now trying to obstruct the 
flow of water in the said irrigation system to the prejudice of other farmers 
whose small pieces of landholdings derive fater from said waterworks. * * *'</p>
<p>" 'Now, City Fiscal Monteclaro and his brother Agustin Monteclaro are closing 
the canal to the prejudice of the landowners along said water system.'</p>
<p>"The worst past of it, Mr. President is that the Justice of the Peace of 
Miagao, Iloilo, without even conducting a preliminary investigation of the case, 
issued a warrant of arrest thereby harassing the herein complainants with cases 
and bonds for our provisional release. By virtue of the power and influence of 
City Fiscal Jose J. Monteclaro, the Justice of the Peace of Miagao, has been 
conniving with him and does not reject a case filed by said Fiscal though the 
evidence is weak and flimsy. Fiscal Monteclaro sometimes issues subpoena in 
connection with land disputes outside of the City of Iloilo particularly, to 
residents of Miagao. Fiscal Jose J. Monteclaro is using his power and influence 
for his personal selfish interest and for the benefit of his close relatives who 
also want to profit by it.' </p>
<p>"Now the working season has already commenced, and we cannot get water from 
the aforesaid communal irrigation canal without facing charges of robbery being 
prepared against us unless your good offices intervene in order to stop the 
foregoing mentioned abuses and oppression.' * * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>which whole letter of the said accused is herein-below reproduced as follows: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>which aforesaid defamatory, malicious and libelous words and statements have 
been read by the officials concerned in the office of the President of the 
Philippines, the PCAC, and office of the Department of Justice, and have been 
also read by the Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo, by the residents of the City of 
Iloilo, by the resident of the Municipality, of Miagao, and by the public in the 
other parts of Panay, and that those libelous and defamatory words and 
statements aforementioned are untrue, false and malicious tending to impeach the 
character, integrity, virtue and reputation of the said Jose J. Monteclaro as 
Second Assistant City Fiscal, as a professor of law, as lawyer and as a private 
citizen, thus placing and causing said Jose J. Monteclaro to public haired, 
contempt, dishonor, discredit and ridicule which acts are serious and insulting 
in nature."</p></blockquote>
<p>On motion to quash filed by appellees the court <i>a quo</i>, on 10 June 
1958, Issued the following order of dismissal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a case of libel. On May 7, 1956, the above-named defendants signed 
and sent a communication to President Ramon Magsaysay denouncing the alleged 
illegal and oppressive acts of the offended party. Article 354 of the Revised 
Penal Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Requirement for publicity.—Every defamatory imputation is presumed to be 
malicious even if it be true, if no good intention and justifiable motive for 
making it is shown, except in the following cases:</p></blockquote>
<p>"1. A private communication made by any person to another in the performance 
of any legal, moral, or social duty; and</p>
<p>"2. A fair and true report, made in good faith, without any comments or 
remarks, of any judicial, legislative, or other official proceedings which are 
not of confidential nature, or of any statements, report, or speech delivered in 
said proceedings, or of any other act performed by public officers in the 
exercise of their functions.'</p>
<p>"The said letter cannot be considereed libelous because it is a private 
communication made by the defendants to the highest magistrate of the land in 
the performance of their legal, moral or social duties.</p>
<p>"Motion to quash, being well taken, the same is hereby granted. Let this case 
be dismissed with costs de oficio and the cancellation of the bond for the 
provisional liberty of the accused."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Solicitor-General, in behalf of the prosecution, has appealed from the 
said order and poses, as the only issue to be resolved, whether or not the 
privileged character of an alleged libelous communication constitutes a legal 
basis for the dismissal of the information based thereon.</p>
<p>The letter reproduced in the information contains statements which on their 
face are defamatory in nature. They impute to the offended party, Iloilo City 
Fiscal Jose J. Monteclaro, the commission of illegal and oppressive acts by 
virtue of his office, the use of his official power and influence for "personal 
selfish interest and for the benefit of his close-relatives," and other acts of 
harassment against appellees. Appellees contend, however—and the contention has 
been sustained by the court below—that the subject-letter, being a private 
communication made by them to the President in the performance of their legal, 
moral or social duty, cannot be considered libelous in view of the exception 
provided in paragraph one, Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>The point is not well taken, and proceeds from a misapprehension of the 
provision just cited. The provision states: "Every defamatory imputation is 
presumed to be malicious even if it be true, if no good intention and 
justifiable motive for making it is shown, except in the following cases: (1) a 
private communication made by any person to another in the performance of any 
legal, moral, or social duty." Libel, as defined under Article 353, has three 
elements: the imputations must be defamatory, it must have been given publicity, 
and it must be malicious. A fourth element may also be considered implicit in 
the provision, namely, that the victim of the libel must be identifiable. The 
defamatory character of the imputation is shown by the recitals thereof. No 
evidence <i>aliunde</i> need be adduced to prove it. With respect to the element 
of malice, the same is established either by presumption or by proof. If nothing 
but the defamatory imputation itself is laid before the court, malice is 
presumed from it, and to overcome this presumption there must be a showing of 
good intention and justifiable motive. In other words, the burden is upon the 
defendants to overcome the legal inference of malice. Under the doctrine of 
qualified privilege, however, this burden does not arise, for the occasion on 
which the communication was made, that is, in the performance of a legal, moral 
or social duty, rebuts the inference. But this does not mean that malice may not 
at all be shown; it simply puts the burden of doing so on the prosecution. As 
much has already been held and explained by this Court in the case of People vs. 
Wenceslao Pascual, 102 Phil., 503, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Said court likewise, erred in dismissing the case upon the ground that the 
letter and the article quoted in the information are qualifiedly privileged 
communications. As stated in Lu Chu Sing vs. Lu Tiong Gui (76 Phil. 669):</p>
<p>" 'Defendant's contention that the charge filed by him in the City Fiscal's 
Office was a privileged communication, is not a proper ground for the dismissal 
of the complaint. In the first place, it is a matter of defense. In the second 
place, the fact that a communication is privileged does not mean that it is not 
actionable; the <i>privileged character simply does away with the presumption of 
malice, which the plaintiff has to prove in such a case</i>. (See Article 354, 
Revised Penal Code.)' (Italics ours).</p>
<p>"The information in this case alleges that the accused have acted 'willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously, and with malicious intent' and the prosecution is 
entitled to a chance to prove this allegation, apart from the fact that the 
truth hereof is deemed hypothetically admitted in the motion to 
dismiss."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellees invoke the case of U.S. vs. Bustos, et al., 37 Phil. 731. That case 
is not here applicable, because the acquittal of the accused therein on the 
ground that the defamatory imputation was qualifiedly privileged was adjudged 
only after trial, wherein the prosecution tried to establish, although 
unsuccessfully, the element of malice.</p>
<p>It need only be added that in the instant case the information alleges that 
the defendants, appellees here, wrote and sent the subject-letter to the 
President "with malicious intent and evil motive of attacking, injuring and 
impeaching the character, honesty, integrity, virtue and reputation of one Jose 
J. Monteclaro * * * and with malicious intent of exposing (him) to public 
hatred, contempt, ridicule, discredit and dishonor, without any justifiable 
motive." Under the foregoing allegation, the prosecution is entitled to go to 
trial and present the necessary evidence to prove malice; and the denial to it 
of the opportunity to do so, upon defendants' motion to quash, constitutes 
reversible error.</p>
<p>In appellees' motion to quash in the lower court they alleged the additional 
ground that the information was filed by the Provincial Fiscal without 
preliminary investigation as required by law. This ground, however, involves a 
question of fact which does not appear in the record before us, and which was 
not resolved by the court below in the order sought to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded for further 
proceedings, without prejudice to such action as the lower court may take, after 
appropriate findings, on the additional ground relied upon by appellees in their 
motion to quash. Costs against defendants-apellees.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>Regala, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
