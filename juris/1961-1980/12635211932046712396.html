				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The specific legal question raised in this petition for the
review of a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is new, but not
the governing principle decisive of the matter, which is well-settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is whether the employer-employee
relationship existed between the claimant Emilio Garcia, now deceased, who in
his lifetime was an ice drop vendor, now substi­tuted by his heirs, the private
respondents,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and petitioner Snow White Ice Cream and Ice Drop Factory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the hearing officer and the then
Associate Commissioner Jose Sanchez of respondent Commission answered the
question in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">There was an appeal to the Commission, which
issued a resolution of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>, as a majority vote
to set aside the award was lacking, Chairman Nieves <span class="SpellE">Baens</span>
del Rosario voting to sustain and the other member <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>
Perez voting to reverse, the aforesaid Commissioner having retired in the
meanwhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a motion for
reconsideration, but with the two Commissioners standing pat, the result was
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the award was not set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition for
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our holding, as will
hereafter be more fully explained, that there was an existence of an
employer-employee relationship based under the governing principle of the
controlling test first announced by this Court through Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> in Investment Planning Corporation v. Social
Security System.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the decision of Commissioner Sanchez, the then
claimant, now deceased, Emilio Garcia "began working with the respondent
as an ice drop vendor in 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
paid on commission basis of P0.02 per ice drop that he sold, thereby earning
approximately P7.00 a day, seven days a week.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As such vendor, his duties consisted mainly of breaking into small
pieces the block of ice given to him, and placing them in the ice drop
push-cart to prevent the ice drops from melting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant, when not selling ice drops,
repaired broken down pushcarts belonging to the respondent, being also a carpenter
by occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that on <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1960</st1:date>, while preparing the
pushcart assigned to him for peddling, a block of the ice he was carrying fell
on his right foot, smashing three of his [toes].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a week of medication, he resumed his
work despite the fact that he was still limping; that while pushing the ice
drop pushcart along <st1:street><st1:address>Solis Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
his swollen right foot was hit by a barbed wire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant, however, continued working until <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1960</st1:date> when he stopped as he
could no longer withstand the pain and chilling sensation that he
suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where his right foot was amputated below the knee, the abscess having already
become gangrenous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He remained in said
hospital until <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. V. <span class="SpellE">Roldan</span>, a
private physician, continued treatment on the claimant while at home until the
amputation wound was completely healed nine months thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant alleged that he spent the total
amount of P<span style="">700.</span>00 for said
treatment."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts which, according to him, were established, follow:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claimant was charged P.03 by the respondent for every ice drop that he
gets which, in turn, he sells to the public at P.05 each; 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant returned the unsold ice drops with
full credit; and 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claimant was
supplied by the respondent with crushed ice, <span class="SpellE">icepicks</span>,
salt, and cap and ice drop pushcart bearing respondent’s trade name."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, in his decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1963</st1:date>, he found for the claimant, thereafter substituted upon
his death on <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1962</st1:date>
by the legal heirs, now private respondents, the circumstances in his opinion
being not merely indicative, but actual proof, of employment and the injuries
sustained occurring while in the performance of his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration was filed with
respondent Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was denied
under the circumstances previously indicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then came this petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted at the outset, we find for private respondents and
sustain the award in their favor.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Under the controlling test as clarified by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> in the aforesaid Social Security System v. Court
of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the criterion is whether the person or firm alleged to be the employer can
direct or require the party <span class="SpellE">assertedly</span> enjoying the
employee status to do a certain kind of work and to specify the means and
methods by which the same is to be accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was emphasized by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> in the above decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The logic of the situation indeed
dictates that where the element of control is absent; where a person who works
for another does so more or less at his own pleasure and is not subject to
definite hours or conditions of work, and in turn is compensated according to
the result of his efforts and not the amount thereof, we should not find that
the relationship of employer and employee exists."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
From the facts as found, which we are not at liberty to disregard, the deceased
claimant was an employee <span style="">of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this is the first case
of its kind in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, it is not so in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
from Larson's authoritative treatise on Workmen's Compensation Law:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Just as the employer may buy his raw
materials outright from an independent businessman, so he can distribute his
product by turning it over completely to a jobber who is an independent
businessman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, since disposition of
the product is normally an inherent part of any business, there is an
increasing tendency to indulge a presumption that salesman, distributors, and deliverymen
who fall short of the status of businessmen holding themselves out to the
public as such are employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
circumstance that the salesman is devoting his entire time to the distribution
of the one employer's product is, in most lines, an indication that he is an
employee."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> An American case cited by him, Cooper v.
Colonial Ice Co.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> lends support to the above view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was pointed out by Larson:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is a stronger case for employment,
in that the iceman did not own the ice wagon he used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is weaker in that the ice, in form at least,
was sold to the driver at $1.20 a block with his compensation coming out of the
difference between that price and his resale price of $1.80.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The privilege of returning unsold ice for
credit tends to discredit the validity of the 'sale.' However, the driver's
business consisted not only of orders received by the company but also of
whatever orders he himself could get.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was some control, in that the driver had to begin work at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="7"><span style="">7 A.M.</span></st1:time><span style=""> and quit before dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was held to be an employee."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. With the decisive question thus answered in favor of private
respondents, it is quite clear why the award in their favor should be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second alleged error as
to the delay of fourteen months in the filing of the claim for compensation
after the alleged injuries does not suffice to call for a reversal in the light
of the impressive number of decisions rendered by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was held in a recent case, Operators,
Incorporated v. <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
"It is much too late in the day to complain about the long delay in
instituting the claim here of seven years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court in 1965 categorically declared that the failure to file a
claim within the statutory period does not affect the jurisdiction of the
Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
a doctrine found mention in a 1968 decision, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
Sugar Mills v. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span>,
citing two cases decided the year before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the first, it took the claimant eight years and in the second, nine
years before the right to compensation was sought to be enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its non-jurisdictional character was stressed
anew in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. v. Workmen's
Compensation Commission, announced less than two months later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the same effect are later cases likewise
of 1968 vintage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have had occasion
this year to rule similarly."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>No discussion need be made of the
third alleged error, being a question of fact, the determination of which by
the Workmen's Compensation Commission is to be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fourth alleged error as to the effect of
a tie vote is likewise unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
recent work on the Workmen's Compensation Act discusses the matter thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Any party in interest may seek the
reconsideration of the decision or order of a member of the Commission by the
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> by filing a motion or petition for reconsideration
within ten (10) days from receipt of said decision or order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of a motion or petition for
reconsideration, the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> shall resolve the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two affirmative or negative votes
shall decide the appealed case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case
of a tie vote, the case shall be calendared for another voting by the
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, and if this second vote again results in a
tie, the original decision or order shall be deemed affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As provided for in Sections 2 and 3 of Rule 17,
the rules for the format of the motion or petition for reconsideration and that
for extension of time to file said motion or petition in the Commission level
is practically the same as that in the regional level."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
