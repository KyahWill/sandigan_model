the Court of Appeals <span style="">resolved to dismiss </span>the appeal "for failure to pay the

<p class="BODY">We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">A rule long familiar to practitioners in this jurisdiction is
that "it is the duty of counsel to adopt and strictly maintain a system
that efficiently takes into account all court notices sent to him."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Controlling here is <u><span style="">Enriquez</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>. <u><span style="">Bautista,</span></u> 79 Phil. 220, 222.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, petitioners' former counsel allegedly failed to receive any of
the three registry notices of the registered letter sent to him by the clerk of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> addressed
"c/o House of Representatives, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>."
This registered mail contains the third order of the court denying petitioners'
intervention in Special Proceedings <span style="">No.
1645 of the said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was intimated
that said attorney failed to get the notices because the House of
Representatives was not then in session and he stayed either in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> or </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bataan</span></span></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We </span><span style="">dismissed this excuse as without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We</span> <span style="">said: "It is
noteworthy that the registered letter of the Clerk of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> containing a copy of the order in
question was sent to the very address given by petitioners' attorney in the
petition for intervention, and there is no showing </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the clerk of court was ever notified by him of any change of
address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The excuse that the attorney
did not stay in one place permanently, cannot be accepted inasmuch as an attorney
owes it to himself and to his clients to invariably adopt a system whereby he
can be sure of receiving promptly all judicial notices during his absence from
his address of record."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Narra</span>,
petitioner's counsel, admits that he has not made provision for a regular clerk
in his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His excuse that he was
"a small practitioner" is unacceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts that he holds his office at the
Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, Inc. and that the two persons who
at different times received the two registry notices in question both hold
responsible positions in the bank, do not sit well with his claim that the
registry notices were not turned over to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel's negligence was inexcusable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No grave abuse of discretion there was on the part of the Court of
Appeals in dismissing the appeal and in refusing to reconsider its resolution
of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">FOR THE REASONS GIVEN</b>,
the resolutions <span style="">under review </span><span class="GramE">are</span> <span style="">hereby affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
