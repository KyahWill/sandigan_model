was shock and massive hemorrhage secondary to mul­tiple stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness identified the autopsy report
which he made, marked Exhibit A in the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to this autopsy report, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Receval</span>
<span class="SpellE">Langlañgan</span> received a total of forty-three wounds - 4
on the head, 10 on the neck, 5 on the anterior part of the body, 10 on the
posterior part of the body, 13 on the upper extremities, and 1 on the lower
extremity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the <span style="">43 wounds, 38 were
stabbed wounds.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The sharp-pointed instruments, marked Exhibits E and E-1 which
were used by the accused <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajor­da</span>
and his co-accused Roger <span class="SpellE">Pereto</span> in killing <span class="SpellE">Langlañgan</span> were properly identified by witness <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Salvador.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also shown during the trial that the ac­cused, <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajorda</span>, on March 25,
1959, the time of the commission of the crime of which he is charged, was
serving in the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prisons in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a term of three
years, six months and twenty-one days of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u> for "evasion of sentence"
(Exhibit C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that he
had a previous conviction for theft.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>only</u> evidence for the defense consists in the
testimony of accused <span class="SpellE">Sajorda</span>, who testified in his
own behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the witness stand, he
disowned his confes­sion, Exhibit B, and denied his participation in the com­mission
of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me declared that it was
Roger <span class="SpellE">Pe­reto</span> alone who killed <span class="SpellE">Receval</span>
<span class="SpellE">Langlañgan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
further declared that at about 6:30 a.m. on March 25, 1959, he was in Brigade
No. 4 lying in bed; that he heard a noise coming from the toilet, and
thereafter he saw Roger <span class="SpellE">Pe­reto</span> with blood on his
hands; that he was not arrested by <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span>
Salvador but was brought by a policeman to the office of Inspector Jimenez;
that he was forced by Roger <span class="SpellE">Pereto</span> and his (<span class="SpellE">Pereto's</span>) companions to go to <span style="">Ji­menez' </span>office and admit having
killed <span class="SpellE">Langlañgan</span> because on that same day he refused
to have himself <span class="SpellE">tattoed</span> with the "OXO"
sign; that he did not give any statement to Inspector Jimenez; that the sworn
statement, Exhibit B, was prepared by Inspector Jimenez without his interven­tion;
that he could not have read the document, Exhibit B, because his educational
attainment <span style="">was
</span>only that of grade III, primary; that if he signed the document it was
because Inspector Jimenez told him that the same was only temporary (<span class="SpellE">pansamantala</span> <span class="SpellE">lamang</span>) and that he
can nar­rate the true facts when the case reaches the court; and that he was
not brought to Acting Assistant Director of Prisons Pedro S. <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>, to have his statements subscribed and sworn to before
him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing evidence, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1962</st1:date>, rendered a deci­sion, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court finds the ac­cused, <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sajorda</span> y Campus, guilty of the crime of murder,
penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and it appearing that
the said accused is a quasi-recidivist, the court, pursuant to Article 160 of
said code, hereby sentences him to death penalty, to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased, <span class="SpellE">Receval</span> <span class="SpellE">Langlañgan</span>,
in the amount of Six Thousand Pesos (P6, 000.00), with no subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half of the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before this Court on automatic re­view due to the
penalty imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question to be resolved at this instance re­volves on the
evaluation of the extra-judicial confession of the accused, Exhibit B, and <span style="">his </span>repudiation
of the same at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, stated in
another way, whether the bare denial by the accused of his participation in the
commission of the crime of which he is charged can be given more weight than
his confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot disregard the confession, Exhibit B, where the accused
expressly acknowledged his participa­tion in the commission of the crime
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is ample evidence which
show that said confession was made by the accused voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inspector <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
Jimenez, who conducted the investigation, declared that all the answers therein
contained were spontaneously and voluntarily given by the accused himself, in
the presence of two employees (witnesses) of his office; that after the
interrogation, he read the statement to the accused para­graph by paragraph,
after which the latter affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> and
signatures thereon; and that when brought to Acting Assistant Director <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>, defendant admitted having given the statements
contained in the document which he signed and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other than the subse­quent repudiation and
self-serving insistence of the ac­cused that his statement, Exhibit B, was
already prepared by Inspector Jimenez when he signed the same, no evidence was
adduced that the declarations in said statement were involuntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true that the answers contained in
the confession were not furnished by the accused, it would have been extremely
easy for him to expose that fact <span style="">before trial, yet no explanation had been given by
him why he never denounced the same to the proper author­ities - an inaction
which heavily argues against the veracity of his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From such inaction, the conclusion can be
drawn that accused had voluntarily con­fessed to his guilt when he was overcome
by remorse of conscience, when the investigation was made after the
killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realizing later the gravity of
his admission, it must have occurred to him, as an afterthought, to re­pudiate
it at the trial and claim innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
cannot discard the confession of an accused simply because he denies what he
stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a similar case, this
Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Besides the testimonies of the state witnesses, we have the
extra-judicial con­fession of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Mansit</span> admitting his individual participation in the
commission of the crime and confirming in material points the State's version
of the foul deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The regularity with
which this confession was executed is sufficiently established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Neofito</span>
Torres, one of those who helped prepare <span class="SpellE">Mansit's</span>
affidavit (Exhibit 'K'), declared that all the answers therein were
spontaneously and voluntarily furnished by <span class="SpellE">Mansit</span>
himself (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> p. 705).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the in­terrogation, the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> <span style="">was </span>allowed to go over his statements
and upon being asked whether the same were true, he replied in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he was brought
to Assistant Director of Prisons Miss before whom <span class="SpellE">Mansit</span>
subscribed and sworn to his af­fidavit.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">clain</span> <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Mansit</span> that </span>Exhibit 'K' <span style="">was </span>already prepared when he signed
it, <span style="">is </span>uncorroborated and his
repudiation came only for the first time when he took the witness stand in
July, 1956, or 1-1/2 years after its execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said in one case:</blockquote>

afterthought born of an eleventh hour attempt to escape cri­minal responsibility.'

et al., L-13030, April 29, 1960)</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the confession of defendant <span class="SpellE">Sajorda</span>,
as well as that of his original co-accused Roger <span class="SpellE">Pereto</span>
which is attached to the record, reveal the precise de­tails of their
conspiracy to liquidate their victim and the <span style="">manner </span>they carried out said conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the accused agreed and
planned to kill the de­ceased because of the grudge they had against him - <span class="SpellE">Pereto</span>, for having been mauled by <span class="SpellE">Langlañgan's</span>
companions when <span class="SpellE">Pereto</span> lost some sweepstakes tickets
he was then selling for the deceased in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City,
and defendant <span class="SpellE">Sajorda</span>, for having been boxed by <span class="SpellE">Langlañgan</span> when he (<span class="SpellE">Sa­jorda</span>) was
a new inmate in the penitentiary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
are motives of the crime which the authorities of the in­sular penitentiary
could not have concocted.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further­more, both accused confessed having
stabbed the de­ceased many times, which is confirmed by the autopsy findings of
the medical officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> Acosta, that the
deceased sustained 43 wounds on different parts of his body, 38 of them being
stabbed wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact, together with
the confiscation of the two sharp-pointed instruments (Exhibits E and E-1) do not
jibe with the claim of herein accused that said wounds were in­flicted by <span class="SpellE">Pereto</span> alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
presumption of the law is in favor of the spontaneity and <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
of the statement given by an accused, and it is incumbent upon him to destroy
that presumption.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, the accused failed to do in the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence has been adduced to
overcome this presumption except his own re­tracting testimony at the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the ques<span style="">tion of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of the confession is one that depends upon
the credibility of witnesses, as between the lone testimony of the accused, on
the one hand, and the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, on the other,
the trial court did not err when it gave greater weight to the latter, not only
because the prosecution witnesses were neutral and disinterested, being
government employees who merely testified as to what transpired in the
performance of their official duties,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but also be­cause
the accused himself had admitted that the prosecution witnesses had no reason
to falsely testify against him, and that he was not subjected to any violence,
torture or bodily harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court
has said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Said issue of the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of
the confession is one depending upon the credibility of contending
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such matter being within the

its finding and conclusion that the confession was voluntarily given and not
forcibly extracted." (People v. Cesar Reyes y <span class="SpellE">Engreso</span>,

<p class="BODY">We have made <span style="">a </span>very thorough examination of the record of this case, and We
fully agree with the follow­ing conclusion of the <span style="">trial </span>court
in <span style="">its </span>decision:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful consideration of the evidence on record, <span style="">it is </span>our considered
opinion that the guilt of the accused <span class="SpellE">Vic­torio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajorda</span> has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no reason to doubt the veracity of
the testimony of Inspector Jimenez who investigated the said accused and that
of prison guard <span class="SpellE">Deo­gracias</span> Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption <span style="">is </span>that said officers regularly performed their official duty
and such presumption has not been overcome by <span style="">evidence </span>to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, no motive has been shown or even
intimated as to why said officers incriminated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot believe that they would be so
totally devoid of conscience <span style="">as </span>to
confabulate on an innocent man.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"We are </span>fully
satisfied, upon examina­tion of the <span style="">extra-judicial </span>confession of the herein
accused, that the same was spon­taneously and voluntarily given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The an­swers to the questions <span style="">are </span>highly
responsive and the statement itself contains informa­tion and details which
could possibly be supplied only by the accused himself."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
a very prominent member of the bar, made the following state­ment in the brief
that he filed for the accused:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“ x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We have pondered and mulled
over this question long and hard, con­scious that the life of <span style="">a </span>human being <span style="">is </span>at stake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We wished we
could with sin­cerity argue in favor of appellant's pretension; but after
carefully consi­dering his extra-judicial confession Exhibit B <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> his uncorroborated testimony during the trial, in
relation to all the circumstances testified to by the witnesses for the
prosecution, we could not honestly sustain appel­lant's professed
innocence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed by the herein accused is mur­der, qualified
by treachery, with the aggravating cir­cumstances of evident premeditation and
quasi-recidivism (Article 160, Revised Penal Code) - circumstances that are
duly established by the evidence.</p>
