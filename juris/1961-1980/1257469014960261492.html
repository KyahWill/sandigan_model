				G.R. No. L-18316, August 31, 1962</h4>
				<H3>RODOLFO CACHUELA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS ACTING MAYOR OF CALINOG, ILOILO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. NATALIO P. CASTILLO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, ET AL., RICARDO PROVIDO, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July 15, 1960, petitioner Rodolfo Cachuela (then Vice-Mayor of Calinog, 
Iloilo) with five councilors of said municipality, filed with the Provincial 
Board of Iloilo a complaint charging respondent Ricardo Provido (Mayor, at the 
time of the same municipality) with neglect of duty and maladministration. 
Acting on said complaint, Iloilo Provincial Governor Jose C. Zulueta, on July 
20, issued an order suspending respondent Provido from office, pending action by 
the board on said charges against him and, on the same date, reproduced said 
complaint to the board, pursuant to Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative 
Code.
<p>Thereafter, respondent Provido appeared before the board, and was 
investigated. On August 30, 1960, he was found guilty as charged, by the 
Vice-Governor and one board member. The two other board members voted for his 
exoneration. With the Governor concurring in the vote finding him guilty, the 
Provincial Board ordered his suspension from office for a period of two months 
effective upon receipt of the decision.</p>
<p>On September 8, 1960, respondent Provido filed with the board a notice of 
appeal, manifesting his intention to appeal said decision to the Executive 
Secretary, in accordance with the provision of Section 2191 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, and praying that the records of the case be forwarded to 
said official. On September 16, the board forwarded the records of the case to 
the Executive Secretary.</p>
<p>On September 21, 1960, petitioner Cachuela filed with this Court a petition 
for prohibition with preliminary injunction (docketed as G. R. No. L-17470) 
against respondents, seeking to restrain respondent Executive Secretary from 
acting on the appeal of respondent Provido, but we dismissed the same by 
resolution of September 26, "without prejudice to action, if any, in the court 
of first instance."</p>
<p>Thereafter, or on October 5, 1960, petitioner Cachuela filed with the Court 
of First Instance of Iloilo the present action for prohibition with preliminary 
injunction (Civil Case No. 5569) against respondents Executive Secretary and 
Provido seeking to restrain respondent Executive Secretary from acting on the 
appeal of respondent Provido.</p>
<p>On October 15, 1960, the court issued a writ of preliminary injunction 
enjoining respondent Executive Secretary from acting on respondent Provido's 
appeal; pending final determination of the case on the merits. However, upon 
respondent's motion for reconsideration, the court issued an order dissolving 
the preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>After respondents have filed their answer to the petition, with a 
counterclaim for damages on the alleged ground that the administrative complaint 
was unfounded and frivolous, the case was tried.</p>
<p>On January 21, 1961, the court rendered judgment dismissing the petition for 
prohibition, as well as respondent Provido's counterclaim, with costs, whose 
pertinent portion read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The main issue raised by the petition is—'that Section 2191 of the Revised 
Administrative Code is unconstitutional'. The petitioner argues that for the 
Executive Secretary to review, revise, revoke, modify or affirm the decision of 
the Provincial Board in this case, would be for it to exercise control over 
local governments and invoked, therefore, Section 10 (1) of Article VII of the 
Constitution—</p>
<p>'The President shall have control of all executive departments, bureaus and 
offices, exercise general supervision over all local governments <i>as may be 
provided by law</i> * * *.' (Italics supplied)</p>
<p>"Section 2191 of the Administrative Code reads:</p>
<p>'SEC. 2191. <i>Action by Secretary of the Interior</i>.—Upon receiving the 
papers in any such proceedings, the Secretary of the Interior shall review the 
case without unnecessary delay and shall make such order for the reinstatement, 
dismissal, suspension, or further suspension of the official, as the facts shall 
warrant and shall render his final decision upon the matter within thirty days 
after the date on which the case was received. Disciplinary suspension made upon 
order of the Secretary of the Interior shall be without pay. No final dismissal 
hereunder shall take effect until recommended by the Department Head and 
approved by the President of the Philippines.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"As appears in the constitutional prohibition 'The President shall have 
control of all executive departments, bureaus or offices, exercise supervision 
over all local governments <i>as may be provided by law</i> and take care that 
the laws be faithfully executed.' Under what provision of the law does the 
President exercise his supervision over all local governments? We see no other 
law that can be invoked to govern the action of the President in the exercise of 
his supervisory authority over local governments than Sections 2188 to 2191 of 
the Revised Administrative Code. In the present case, to bring the matter 
involving the decision of the Provincial Board to the Office of the President on 
appeal, is not unconstitutional, and this was recognized and upheld in the case 
of Hebron vs. Reyes (supra) [104 Phil., 175]. Indeed, it is, likewise, 
well-settled that laws Governing the suspension or removal of public officers, 
especially those chosen by the direct vote of the people, must be strictly 
construed in their favor.'</p>
<p>'Accordingly, when the procedure for the suspension of an officer is 
specified by law, the same must be deemed mandatory and adhered to strictly, in 
the absence of express or clear provision to the contrary—which does not exist 
with respect to municipal officers. What is more, the <i>language of sections 
2188 to 2191 of the Revised Administrative Code</i> leaves no room for doubt 
that the law-in the words of Justice Tuason-frowns upon prolonged or indefinite 
suspension of local elective officials". (Lacson vs. Roque, 92 Phil., 456; 49 
Off. Gaz. 93), (Italics supplied.)</p>
<p>"By the theory of the petitioner herein, he wants to make it clear and thus 
upholds that the decision of the Provincial Board cannot be appealed, on the 
ground that to do so would make the President exercise direct control over the 
actuations of the Provincial Board. The office of the President to exercise 
jurisdiction over the decision of the Provincial Board on appeal, would only be 
exercising its supervisory authority over the same. The appellate authority of 
the office of the President is best recognized in the very case of Hebron vs. 
Reyes (supra) * * *</p>
<p>"Regarding the counterclaim filed by the respondent Ricardo Provido, the 
Court has found that charges were filed against the said Ricardo Provido as 
Municipal Mayor of Calinog, Iloilo, for Neglect of Duty and Maladministration by 
the petitioner, Rodolfo Cachuela, Vice-Mayor and Felix Catoto, Luis Ortizo, 
Guillermo Castro, Jesus Carbon, and Ildefonso Pasaporte, Municipal Councilors of 
Calinog, Iloilo. This same complaint is embodied in the administrative charges 
filed by the Provincial Governor of Iloilo, Hon. Jose C. Zulueta (Annex A to the 
petition). * * *</p>
<p>"By virtue of said administrative case against the respondent Ricardo 
Provido, the Provincial Board on August 30, 1960, after investigation, found the 
respondent Ricardo Provido guilty as charged in the complaint, and ordered his 
suspension from office for a period of two (2) months effective upon receipt of 
the decision (Annex B).</p>
<p>"Under this set of facts, the Court finds that the counterclaim is 
unjustified. Private citizens, as well as public officials in a government like 
ours, where the authority of governing officials emanates from the governed, it 
is the duty of the citizens to bring to the attention of the corresponding 
authorities the abuses, the omissions, or maladministration committed by such 
officials. Complaints filed by them, therefore, in this connection against any 
misconduct in any public office are qualifiedly privileged and, as such, they 
cannot serve as basis for counterclaim against the complainants.</p>
<p>"FOR ALL THE THE FOREGOING, the petition for prohibition, as well as the 
counterclaim of the respondent Ricardo Provido, are hereby dismissed with costs 
against the petitioners.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>Dissatisfied with said decision, petitioner Cachuela appealed to us. 
Respondent Provido also appealed from that portion of the decision dismissing 
his counterclaim against petitioner Cachuela.</p>
<p>As heretofore stated, the present action is for prohibition, seeking to 
restrain the respondent Executive Secretary from acting on the appeal of 
respondent Provido on the alleged ground that Section 2191 of the Revised 
Administrative Code authorizing such an appeal is unconstitutional insofar as it 
empowers the President to review the decision of the Provincial Board because 
such power of review, which includes the power to correct, alter, modify, 
revise, or annul amounts to an exercise by the President, of "control" over 
local governments forbidden by the Constitution. It appears, however, from the 
records of this case that the Executive Secretary, upon being advised of the 
dissolution of the preliminary injunction by the lower court acted on the appeal 
and, rendered on November 23, 1960 a decision exonerating the respondent Provido 
from the charges of negligence of duty and maladministration. It, likewise, 
appears that the suspension imposed by the Provincial Board was for a period of 
two months effective upon receipt by the respondent Provido of such a decision. 
Provido was notified of the order of suspension on September 6, 1960 and the 
two-month period of suspension expired on November 6, 1960. Under the 
circumstances, as the act sought to be enjoined in this prohibition proceedings 
has already been performed and there is nothing more to restrain, the case has 
become academic and moot. And since the question of the unconstitutionality of 
the statute involved is not so clear and its resolution not so peremptorily 
necessary under the present facts of the case, this Court, pursuant to 
prevailing jurisprudence on the matter, should now decline to pass judgment on 
the controversy which, for practical purposes, has become abstract or 
non-existent.</p>
<p>The appeal of the respondent Provido against the decision of the lower court 
dismissing his counter-claim for damages predicated on the claim that the 
administrative complaint was unfounded and frivolous, is without merit. We agree 
with the lower court that the administrative complaint is a qualified privileged 
communication and since the lower court found no evidence of malice or bad faith 
on the part of petitioner Cachuela, the dismissal of the counter-claim is 
justified.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the appeal of petitioner Rodolfo Cachuela is hereby 
dismissed as presenting an already moot question, and the decision of the lower 
court dismissing the counterclaim of respondent Provido is hereby affirmed. No 
costs. So ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla,, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. 
B. L., Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
