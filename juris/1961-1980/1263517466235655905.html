the emoluments at­tached thereto, continuously, up to December 31, 1963, when
the newly elected mayor of San Joaquin, respondent Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Santacera</span>,

held by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon denial by <span class="SpellE">Santacera</span> of their request for reinstatement and payment of
their salaries, petitioners commenced, with the court of first instance of
Iloilo, the present action for <u>quo</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
and mandamus with damages, upon the ground that, although not civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>, they are war vet­erans and, as such, entitled to

appointees, who are neither civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It
should be noted that Jesus <span class="SpellE">Semper</span>, one of the petitioners
in the lower court, who was found not to be a war veteran and, hence, not
entitled to reinstatement, is not involved in this appeal, he hav­ing failed to
seek a review of the decision of said court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As
regards the other petitioners herein, who, admittedly, are war veterans,
appellants maintain that Section 8 of Republic Act No. 65, as amended by
Section 1 of Republic Act No. 154, reading:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 8. For a period of three years from the time of the
passage of this Act, the persons mentioned in sections one and two hereof
shall, all other quali­fications being equal:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1) Have
preference in appointments and promo­tions in and to any Government office,
agency, or in­strumentality, or in and to any Government-owned or subsidized
corporation, the provisions of law as to civil service eligibility
notwithstanding: Provided, That in examinations where experience is an element
of qualification the time spent in the military or naval service of the United
States or of the Philippines shall be credited in a veteran's rating where his
actual em­ployment in a similar vocation to that for which he is examined was
interrupted by such military or naval service."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">does not justify the decision appealed from, inasmuch as: (a) peti­tioners
were merely temporary employees; (b) the preference given to war veterans in
said Section 8, as, amended, refers only to "appointments and
promotions," not to the retention of the office they hold; and (c) said
preference is good only "for a period of three (3) years from the time of
the passage" of said Republic Act No. 154, on June 14, 1947, so that
petitioners' separation from the service on December 31, 1963 is beyond the
pale of said legis­lation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is
true that "temporary" employees may be removed at any time, in the
absence of a legal provision to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp;

by the law is not only an appointment whereby a veteran is accepted in the
service of the Government but also his <u>enjoyment of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the benefits</u>, rights and emoluments
accruing from said appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
certainly be unjust as well as illogical if after appointing a non-veteran to a
Government position today, he may be replaced and dismissed tomorrow, when
there are non-veterans occupying other and similar positions who could and
should be replaced first. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

determining, primarily confidential, nor highly technical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, they are not ask­ing for any
promotion or transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All their wish
and desire is that they be allowed to retain their positions and continue
serving the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By interpreting
the law in this manner, namely, giving preference to a veteran, not only in the
appointment but also in keeping the position to which he is appointed, we would
be following and implementing the intention of the Legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the lower court, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> rather vehemently observed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provisions of law should
be given full force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
intention of the framers of the law to reward those who have risked their lives
and sacrificed much in order that we could be freed from Japanese domination
should not be implemented with empty promises and hollow gestures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should give what is due the veterans as
contemplated by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For that is the
only way we could repay and show our gratitude to the heroes of the last world
war.'"</blockquote>
