				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by certiorari, taken by the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
Stevedoring Transportation Co. – hereinafter re­ferred to as the Company – and
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Xaudaro</span>, from an order of the Court of Industrial
Relations, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court, finding respondents guilty of un­fair labor
practice as charged, directs them to cease and desist from such unfair labor
practice and to re­instate the complainants, with back wages from the date they
were laid off until reinstated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Company is engaged in the loading and unloading of vessels,
with a branch office in <span class="SpellE">Hinigaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, under the manage­ment of said Rafael <span class="SpellE">Xaudaro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its workers
are supplied by the United Workers and Farmers Association, a labor
organization – hereinafter referred to as UWFA – whose men (affiliated to
various labor unions) have regularly worked as laborers of the Company during
every milling season since immediately after World War II up to the milling
season immediately preceding November 11, 1955, when the Company refused to
engage the services of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dano-og</span>,
Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Agarcio</span> and 137 other persons named in
the complaint filed in case No. 62-ULP-Cebu of the Court of Industrial
Relations –<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and hereinafter referred to
as the Complainants – owing, they claim, to their union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the be­hest of the UWFA and the
Complainants, a complaint for unfair labor practice was, accordingly, filed
against the Company and <span class="SpellE">Xaudaro</span> with the Court of
Industrial Relations – hereinafter referred to as the CIR – in which it was
docketed as Case No. 62-ULP-Cebu.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due
course, its Presiding Judge issued the order appealed from, which was affirmed
by the CIR sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence this petition for review by certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in this appeal, are (1) whether there is
employer-employee relationship between the Company and the Com­plainants; (2)
whether the Company has been guilty of unfair labor practice; and (3) whether
the order of reinstatement of Complainants, with <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>,
is a reversible error.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first question, the Company maintains that it
had never had an employer-employee relationship with the Complainants, the
latter's services having allegedly been engaged by the UWFA, not by the
Company, and that, in any event, whatever contractual relation there may have
been between the Company and the Complainants had ceased at the end of each
milling season, so that the Company can not be guilty of unfair labor practice
in refusing to renew said relation at the beginning of the milling season in
November, 1955.</p>

<p class="BODY">This pretense is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although Complainants, through the labor union to which they belong,
form part of UWFA, there was no in­dependent contract between the latter, as an
organization, and the Com­pany.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the first milling season subsequently to the liberation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Complainants merely reported for work, at the beginning of each succeeding
milling season, and their services were invariably avail­ed of by the Company,
although an officer of the UWFA or union concern­ed determined the laborers who
would work at a given time, following a rotation system arranged <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the performance of their duties, Complainants worked, however,
<u>under the direction and control of the officers of the Company</u>, whose
paymaster, or disbursing officer paid the corresponding compen­sation <u>directly</u>
to said Complainants, who, in turn, acknowledged receipt in payrolls of the
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already held that
laborers working under these conditions are employees of the Company,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in the same manner as watchmen or security guards furnished, under similar
circumstances, by watchmen or security agencies,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
inasmuch as the agencies and/or labor organizations involved therein merely
performed the role of a representative or agent of the employer in the
recruitment of men needed for the operation of the latter's business.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the alleged termination of employer-employee
relationship between the Company and the Complainants at the conclusion of each
milling season, it is, likewise, settled that the workers concerned are
considered, <u>not</u> separated from the service, but, merely <u>on leave of
absence</u>, without pay, during the off-season, their employer-employee
relationship being merely deemed suspended, not severed, in the mean­while.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Referring to the unfair labor practice charge against the
Company, we find, with the CIR, that said charge is substantially borne out by
the evidence of record, it appearing that the workers not admitted to work
beginning from November, 1955, were precisely those belonging to the UWFA, and
that <span class="SpellE">Xaudaro</span>, the Company branch Manager, had told
them point blank that severance of their connection with the UWFA was the
remedy, if they wanted to continue working with the Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the payment of back wages, the law<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
explicitly vests in the CIR discretion to order the reinstatement with back pay
of laborers dismissed due to union activities, and the record does not disclose
any cogent reason to warrant interference with the action taken by said Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order and resolution appealed from are
hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioners herein.</p>
