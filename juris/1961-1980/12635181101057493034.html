court to state the premise after the Land Reform Code had already been enacted,
that "the systems of agricultural tenancy recognized in this jurisdiction
are <u>share</u> tenancy and <u>leasehold</u> tenancy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A more accurate statement of the premise is
that based on the <u>transitory</u> provision in the first proviso of section 4
of the Code, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e. that existing share tenancy
contracts are allowed to continue temporarily in force and effect, not with­standing
their express abolition, until whichever of the following events occurs
earlier: (a) the end of the agricultural year when the National Land Reform
Council makes the proclama­tion declaring the region or locality a land reform
area; </span><span style="">or
</span><span style="">(b)
the shorter period provided in the share tenancy contracts expires; or (c) the
share tenant sooner exercises his option to elect the leasehold system.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In anticipation of the expiration of share tenancy con­tracts --
whether by contractual stipulation or the tenant's exercise of his option to elect
the leasehold system instead or by virtue of their nullity -- <span class="SpellE">occuring</span> before the proclama­tion of the locality as a land
reform area, the same section <span style="">4 </span>has
further declared in the third proviso thereof that in such event, the tenant
shall continue in possession of the land for cultivation and "there shall
be presumed to exist a leasehold relationship under the provisions of this
Code."</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing exposes the
error of the agrarian <span style="">court's </span>corollary
premise that "a <u>share</u> tenant is altogether different from a <u>leasehold</u>
tenant." The agrarian court's dictum that 'their respective rights and
obligations are not co-extensive or co-equal" refer to their <u>contractual</u>
relations with the landowner, with respect to the contributions given,
management, division or payment of the produce.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>But the Land Reform Code
forges by operation of law, between the landowner and the farmer -- be he a
leasehold tenant or temporarily a share tenant -- a <u>vinculum</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span> <span style="">with
certain vital juridical consequences, such as security of tenure of the tenant
and the tenant's right to continue in posses­sion of the land he works despite
the expiration of the contract or the sale or transfer of the land to third
persons, and now, more basically, the farmer's <u>pre-emptive</u> right to buy
the land he cultivates under section 11 of the Code</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as well as the right to <u>redeem</u> the
land, if sold to a third person with­out his knowledge, under section 12 of the
Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is an essential and indispensable mandate of the Code to
implement the State's policy of establishing owner-<span class="SpellE">cultivatorship</span>
and to achieve a dignified and self-reliant exist­ence for the small farmers
that would make them a pillar of strength of our Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from expropriation by the Land
Authority of private agricultural land for resale in economic family-size farm
units "to <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> tenants, occupants and qualified
farmers,"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the purchase by farmers of the lands cultivated by them, when the owner decides
to sell the same -- <span class="SpellE">throught</span> the rights of
pre-emption and redemption -- are the only means prescribed by the Code to
achieve the declared policy of the State.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agrarian court
therefore facilely let itself fall into the error of concluding that the right
of redemption (as well as necessarily the right of preemption) imposed by the
Code is available to <u>leasehold</u> tenants only and excludes <u>share</u>
tenants for the literal reason that the Code grants said rights only to <span style="">the "<u>agricultural lessee</u> and to
nobody else."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, it immediately
comes to mind that the Code did not mention tenants, whether leasehold or share
tenants, because it outlaws share tenancy and envisions the agricultural
leasehold system as its </span><span style="">replacement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">Thus, Chapter I of the
Code, comprising sec­tions 4 to 38, extensively deals with the establishment of
<u>'agri­cultural leasehold relations</u>," defines the parties thereto
and the rights and obligations of the "<u>agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span></u>"
and of the "<u>agricultural lessee</u>" (without the slightest
mention of <u>leasehold tenants</u>) and the statutory consideration or <u>rental</u>
for the lease­hold to be paid by the lessee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a studied omission in the Code of the use of the term tenant in
deference to the "aboli­tion of tenancy" as proclaimed in the very
title of the Code, and the elevation of the tenant's status to that of lessee.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, the terms "agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>"
and "agricultural lessee" are consistently used throughout the
Chapter and carried over to the particular sections (11 and 22) on pre-emption
and redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agrarian court's
literal construction would wreak havoc on and defeat the proclaimed and
announced legis­lative intent and policy of the State of establishing owner-<span class="SpellE">cul­tivatorship</span> for the farmers, who invariably were all <span style="">share </span>tenants; before the enactment of
the Code and whom the Code would now uplift to the status, of lessees.</p>

<p class="BODY">A graphic instance of this fallacy would be found in sec­tion 11
providing that "In case the <u>agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span></u>
decides to sell the landholding the <u>agricultural <span style="">lessee</span></u><span style=""> </span>shall
have the pre­ferential right to buy the same under reasonable terms and
conditions."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be seen that
the term "<u>agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span></u>" is
here used interchangeably with the term "<u>landowner</u>"; <span class="GramE">which</span> conflicts with the Code's definition of "<u>agricultural
<span class="SpellE">lessor</span></u>" to mean "a person, natural or
juridical, who, either as owner, civil law lessee, <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span>,
or legal possessor, lets or grants to another the cultivation and use of his
land for a price certain."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously, the Code imprecisely referred to <span style="">the "agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> (who) decides
to sell the landholding," when it could have more precisely referred to
the "<u>landowner</u>", who alone as such, rather than a civil law
lessee, <span class="SpellE">usufruct­uary</span> or legal possessor, could sell
the landholding, but it certainly cannot be logically contended that the
imprecision should defeat the clear spirit and intent of the provision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have, here, then a
case of where the true intent of the law is clear that calls for the
application of the cardinal rule of statutory construction that such intent or
spirit must prevail over the letter thereof, for whatever is within the spirit
of a statute is within the statute, since adherence to the letter would result
in absurdity, injustice and contradictions and would defeat the plain and vital
purpose of the statute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11 of the Code providing for <span style="">the </span>"agricultural lessee's" preferential right to buy
the land he cultivates provides expressly that "the entire landholding
offered for sale must be pre-empted by the Land Authority if the landowner so
desires, unless the majority of the lessees object to such acquisition",
presumably for being beyond their capabilities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taken together with the provisions of Chapter III of the Code on <span style="">t</span>he organiza­tion and functions of the
Land Authority and Chapter VII on the Land Project Administration and the
creation and functions of the National Land Reform Council, (in which chapters
the legis­lature obviously was not laboring <span style="">under </span>the inhibition of <span class="SpellE">refering</span> to the
term <u>tenants</u> as it was <span style="">in </span>Chapter
I establishing the agricultural leasehold system and decreeing the abolition of
share tenancy),<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Code's intent, policy and objective to give both agricultural lessees and
farmers who transitionally continue to be share tenants notwithstanding the
Code's enact<span style="">ment,
the same priority and preferential rights over the lands under their
cultivation, in the event of acquisition of the lands, by expropriation or
voluntary sale, for distribution or resale that may be initiated by the Land
Authority or the National Land Reform Council, are clearly and expressly
stated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus Chapter III, section 51 of the Code <span style="">decrees </span>it the responsibility of the Land Authority "(1) To
initiate and prose­cute expropriation proceedings for the acquisition of private
agricultural lands as defined in Section one hundred sixty-six of Chapter XI of
this Code for the purpose of subdivision into economic family-size farm units
and resale of said farm units to <u>bona fide</u> <u>tenants</u>, <u>occupants
and qualified farmers</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
and "(2) To help <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> <u>farmers</u> without lands or
agricultural owner-cultivators of uneconomic-size farms to acquire and own
economic family size farm units x <span class="SpellE">x</span> ."</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, Chapter VII, section 128 of the Code, in en­joining
the National Land Reform Council to formulate the necessary rules and
regulations to implement the Code's pro­visions for selection of agricultural
land to be acquired and <span style="">distributed and of the beneficiaries of the family farms, ordains the
giving of the same priority "to the <u>actual</u> <u>occupants</u>
personal­ly cultivating the land <u>either as agricultural lessees </u></span><u><span style="">or </span></u><u><span style="">other­wise</span></u><span style=""> with respect to
the area under their cultivation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would certainly result
in absurdity, contradictions and injustice if a share tenant would be denied
the rights of pre-emption and redemption which he seeks to exercise <u>on his
own resources</u>, notwithstanding that the National Land Reform Council has
not yet proclaimed that all the government machineries and agencies in the
region or locality envisioned in the Code are oper­ating -- which machineries
and agencies, particularly, the Land Bank were precisely created "to
finance the acquisition by the Government of landed estates for division and
resale to small landholders, as well as the purchase of the landholding by the
agricultural lessee from the landowner."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The non-operation in the interval of the Land Bank and the government
machineries and agencies in the region which are envisioned in the Code to
assist the share tenant in shedding off the yoke of tenancy and afford him the
financial assistance to exercise his option of electing the leasehold system
and his preferential right of purchasing the land cultivated by him could not
possibly have been intended by Congress to prevent the exercise of any<span style=""> of these vital
rights by a share tenant who is able to do so, e. g. to purchase the land, oh
his own and without government assistance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be absurd and unjust that while the government is unable to
render such assistance, the share tenant would be deemed deprived of the very
rights granted him by the Code which he is in a position to exercise even
without government assistance.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein lies the
distinction between the present case and <span class="SpellE"><u>Basbas</u></span><u>

where the Court upheld the agra­rian court's dismissal of the therein tenant's
action to redeem the landholding sold to a third party by virtue of the
tenant's failure to tender payment or consign the purchase price of the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, the tenant-<span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> was shown by the evidence have no funds and
had merely applied for them to the Land Authority which was not yet operating
in the locality and hence, the Court held that no part of the Code
"indicates or even hints that the 2-year redemption period will not com<span style="">mence to run

</span>The clear and logical implication of <span class="SpellE"><u>Basbas</u></span>
is where the tenant has </span><span style="">his own </span><span style="">resources or secures redemption funds from sources other than the Land
Bank or government agencies </span>under <span style="">the

no relevance and cannot prejudice the tenant's rights under the Code to </span><span style="">redeem </span><span style="">the land­holding.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even from the landowner's

landowner's written notice.) As for the vendees, neither are they prejudiced
for they will get back from the tenant-<span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
the price that they paid the vendor, if reasonable, since the Code grants the
agricultural lessee or tenant the top priority of redemption of the landholding
cultivated by him and expressly decrees that the same "shall have priority
over any other right of legal redemption."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of any provision in the Code as to manner of and amounts
payable on redemption, the pertinent provisions of the Civil Code apply in a <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span> character.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the vendees would be entitled to receive from the <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span>
the amount of their purchase besides "(1) the expenses of the contract,
and any other legitimate payments made by reason of the sale; (and) (2) the

<p class="NUM">8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The historical background
for the enactment <span style="">of the </span>Code's
provisions on pre-emption and redemption further streng­thens the Court's
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noted by Dean <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
that "(T<span class="GramE">)his</span> is a new right which has not been
granted to tenants under the Agricultural Tenancy Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further bolsters the security of tenure of
the agricultural lessee and further encour­ages agricultural lessees to become
owner-cultivators.</p>

<p class="BODY">“In the past, a landlord often ostensibly sold his land being
cultivated by his tenant to another tenant, who in turn filed a petition <span style="">for </span><span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
against the first tenant on the <span style="">ground
of personal cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While many of
such sales were </span><span style="">simulated, there was a formal transfer of title in every case, and the
first tenant was invariably ordered ejected."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is indication in this case of the same pattern of sale by
the landowner to another tenant,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
in order to effect the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of
petitioners-tenants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is further
bolstered by the fact that the sales were executed by respondent-vendor on
September 27, 1963 and March 2, 1964 shortly after the enactment on August 8,
1963 of the Land Reform Code -- which furnishes still another reason for
upholding petitioners-tenants' right of redemption, for certainly a landowner
cannot be permitted to defeat the Code's clear intent by precipitately
disposing of his lands, even before the tenant has been given the time to exer­cise
his newly granted option to elect the new agricultural lease­hold system
established by the Code as a replacement for the share tenancy outlawed by it.</p>

<p class="NUM">9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly then, the Code
intended, as above discussed, to afford the farmers, who <u>transitionally</u>
continued to be share tenants after its enactment but who inexorably would be
agricultural lessees by virtue of the Code's proclaimed abolition of tenancy,
the same priority and preferential right as those <u>other share tenants</u>,
who upon the enactment of the Code or soon thereafter were <u>earlier converted
by fortuitous circumstance</u> into agricultural lessees, to acquire the lands
under their culti­vation in the event of their voluntary sale by the owner or
of their acquisition, by expropriation <span style="">or

<p class="BODY">The agrarian court's dismissal of the cases at bar should
therefore be reversed and petitioners-tenants' right to redeem the landholdings
recognized under section 12 of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Case L-25326, however, the deed of sale executed by
respondent-vendor in favor of respondents-vendees for the price of P4,000.00
covers three parcels of land, while what is sought to be redeemed is only the
first parcel of land, of 22,876 square meters, described in the deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners-tenants' allegation that the proportionate
worth of said parcel, "taking into account the respective areas,
