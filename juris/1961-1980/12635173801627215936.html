<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime in September
1963 Jose Robles borrowed the sum </span>of P25, 000 from Chan Too, <span style="">to ensure payment of which the Alto Surety
&amp; Insurance Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred to as ALTO) executed a bond for
25, 000 </span>in favor -of Chan Too, <span style="">whereby
it bound itself jointly and severally with Robles for the payment of the loan
to Chan Too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consideration for the
issuance of the said bond, Robles, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>

severally to </span>indemnify <span style="">A</span>LTO <span style="">for
any damage, loss, payments of whatever kind or nature, including attorney's
fees, which might be incurred by the latter as a result of the bond
issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counter - guaranty agreement

said sum or sums or part thereof, have been actually paid or not.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Proceeding now to a
consideration of the petitioner's stance, </span><span style="">we note </span><span style="">that the sole
foundation of his position is that he </span><span style="">was released from his </span><span style="">obligation
under the counter-guaranty agreement by </span><span style="">virtue of <span class="SpellE">novation</span> </span><span style="">because the compromise agreement entered </span><span style="">into by </span><span style="">Chan Too, Jose Robles and ALTO </span><span style="">in civil case 29357, to which the petitioner claims he was a party, </span><span style="">had the legal effect of binding all the
parties exclusively to the terms thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner's sole
argument is based </span><span style="">on palpably
erroneous assumptions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner
erroneously assumes that he was a party case in civil case 29357 where the
compromise agreement was executed, in accordance with which judgment was
rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discover</span><span style="">ing that</span><span style=""> he has ensnared himself in his own net of
fiction, he now attempts to disentangle himself by</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">contending
that when ALTO - entered into the</span><span style="">
</span><span style="">compromise agreement in civil
case 29357, it </span><span style="">thereby waived its </span><span style="">right
to proceed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were he </span><span style="">really a party to
the said civil </span><span style="">case 29357, his
argument might perhaps merit attention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It </span><span style="">is patent </span><span style="">from the
record, however, that the </span><span style="">only parties </span><span style="">in the said civil case were Chan Too as plaintiff and </span><span style="">Jose Robles and </span><span style="">ALTO as defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the situation, </span><span style="">the compromise </span><span style="">agreement in that case served to determine
the </span><span style="">rights
and </span><span style="">obligations of only parties
therein, namely </span><span style="">Chan Too as creditor </span><span style="">and
Robles and ALTO as debtor and surety <span style="">res</span></span><span style="">pectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner likewise
erroneously assumes that the </span><span style="">present case was </span><span style="">instituted by ALTO on the basis of the </span><span style="">judgment rendered in civil case </span><span style="">29357. ALTO instituted this action against </span><span style="">the petitioner on </span><span style="">the basis, not of the compromise agreement
nor of the judgment rendered in accordance therewith, but of the separate and
distinct "agreement of counter-guaranty" which he had executed
jointly and severally with Robles and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While the said agreement
is captioned "counter-guaranty," a close perusal of its terms reveals
that it is actually one of </span><span style="">in</span><span style="">demnity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably, the agreement explicitly provides
that the obligatio</span><span style="">n to </span><span style="">indemnify ALTO arises
"as soon as demand </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">received
</span><span style="">from
the creditor" or "as soon as </span><span style="">it (ALTO) becomes liable to make payment of any sum under the terms of
the above-mentioned Bond, or any renewals, extensions or substitutions, </span><u><span style="">whether the said sum or sums or part </span></u><u><span style="">thereof,</span></u><span style=""> <u>have been actually paid or not.</u>" </span><span style="">(emphasis supplied)
</span><span style="">On June 21, 1956 ALTO demanded
from the </span><span style="">petitioner </span><span style="">fulfillment of
his obligations under the agreement </span><span style="">since it had before then received from Chan </span><span style="">Too a demand for payment </span><span style="">by virtue </span><span style="">of the bond it had </span><span style="">issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">A</span><span style="">nother

</span><span style="">the
action b</span><span style="">y</span><span style=""> Chan </span><span style="">Too against Jose Robles and ALTO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing </span><span style="">of the complaint </span><span style="">(by Chan too </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">civil case 29357) itself constituted </span><span style="">a judicial demand on </span><span style="">ALTO, and </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">accordance with the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">abovecited</span></span><span style=""> provision </span><span style="">of the "agreement of
counter-guaranty" the obligation of </span><span style="">the petitioner thus then matured.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><span style="">contract here
involved </span><span style="">which was executed by
the peti</span><span style="">tioner </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a contract of indemnity </span><span style="">not
only against actual loss but against liability as well, and it </span><span style="">will </span><span style="">not avail the petitioner </span><span style="">any

the plaintiff had not yet paid its liability under the bond, it had no cause of

<blockquote>"The dismissal of the complaint by the trial court is

<p class="BODY">There being no modicum of doubt, in this case before us, that the
obligation of the petitioner has matured, the release of his obligation by
virtue of <span class="SpellE">novation</span> must be proved by clear and
convincing evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of
an express release, nothing less than a showing of complete incompatibility
between the two obligations - the "agreement of counter - guaranty"
and the compromise agreement - would justify a finding of <span class="SpellE">novation</span>
by implication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The express mandate of
the law that for an obligation to be extinguished by another “it is imperative

The necessity to prove the same by clear and convincing evidence <span style="">is </span>accentuated where, as in this case,
the obligation of the debtor has already matured.</p>

<p class="BODY">We<span style=""> fail to see any
incompatibility between the two obliga</span>tions that would sustain the
defense of <span class="SpellE">novation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that in the compromise agreement and subsequently in the
execution sale, ALTO chose first to realize its credit from Robles, did not
imply waiver of its right to process against any of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
debtors or some or all of them simultaneously, and the demand made against one
of them is no obstacle to demands which may subsequently be directed against
the others so long as the debt <span style="">or </span>any part of it remains outstanding and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon all the foregoing,
inescapable conclusion is that the compromise agreement on the basis of which
