				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 18, 1954 the Provincial Fiscal of La Union filed an information &nbsp;for &nbsp;double &nbsp;murder &nbsp;(of Hilario Zuniega and his wife, Felicisima Peritu), against Ambrosio Belen, Fausto Peritu, Sotero Peritu, Fernando &nbsp;Peritu, Florentino Estipular, Bernardo &nbsp;Estipular, &nbsp; Maximo &nbsp;Delinila, &nbsp;Sotero &nbsp;Banay and Andres &nbsp;Balas. &nbsp;The information was later amended to include Crispulo &nbsp;Mabalo &nbsp;and &nbsp;Florencio Hidalgo &nbsp;as defendants. &nbsp;&nbsp;All the &nbsp;accused pleaded not guilty. &nbsp;&nbsp;After several prosecution witnesses testified, Ambrosio Belen withdrew his former plea and substituted it with a plea of guilty upon re- arraignment on the amended information. &nbsp;He &nbsp;was sentenced &nbsp;by the &nbsp;Court of &nbsp; First Instance of La Union to two separate penalties of&nbsp; <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and afterwards &nbsp;utilized &nbsp;by the &nbsp;prosecution as witness against the &nbsp;ten &nbsp;other accused. &nbsp;After trial the court &nbsp;found &nbsp;all of &nbsp;them &nbsp;guilty as charged. &nbsp;Each was sentenced to double &nbsp;life &nbsp;imprisonment, &nbsp;to &nbsp;indemnify the heirs of the deceased spouses, jointly and &nbsp;severally &nbsp;with Ambrosio Belen, in the sum &nbsp;of &nbsp;P6,000.00 and to pay the costs. <p>From said decision the ten accused appealed &nbsp;to this Court. &nbsp;On &nbsp;record &nbsp;&nbsp; are &nbsp;a printed brief &nbsp;for appellants Andres Balas, Maximo Delinila, Florentino &nbsp; Estipular, Bernardo Estipular, &nbsp;Sotero &nbsp;Banay, Sotero Peritu, Fernando Peritu and Fausto Peritu; a &nbsp;separate mimeographed brief for the three Peritus; and a motion filed by counsel <em>de oficio</em> for appellants Crispulo Mabalo and Florencio Hidalgo, stating that from the records of the case there is nothing on &nbsp;which to predicate &nbsp;a good defense that may justify reversal or modifications of &nbsp;the appealed judgment, which motion was considered by this Court as the &nbsp; brief for said &nbsp;appellants.</p> <p>Undisputed by both prosecutions and defense are these facts: Late &nbsp;in the evening of December 9, &nbsp;1952 the &nbsp;above named eleven accused, including Ambrosio Belen, went to a brook &nbsp; west of the house of Hilario Zuniega &nbsp;and his second wife &nbsp;Felicisima Peritu, located &nbsp; at barrio Basca, Aringay, La Union. &nbsp;Eight of them remained &nbsp;near the brook, while Ambrosio &nbsp;Belen and the &nbsp;rest &nbsp;(as &nbsp;to whose identities the evidence is &nbsp;conflicting), went up the house. Belen &nbsp;shot Zuniega dead after which &nbsp;his wife &nbsp;was &nbsp;also killed. Then Belen called &nbsp;the others &nbsp;who &nbsp;were by the brook &nbsp;and told &nbsp;them to come up the &nbsp;house, &nbsp;which they did. &nbsp;Belen, Florencio Hidalgo, Andres Balas and the three Peritus &nbsp;(Fausto and his &nbsp;sons Sotero and Fernando) &nbsp;dug a grave &nbsp;some distance from the Zuniega house and there buried the two victims. &nbsp;Then they returned to the Zuniega house &nbsp;and cleaned it of &nbsp;the &nbsp;bloodstains which &nbsp;had been left. &nbsp; Meanwhile, &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;rest &nbsp;of the &nbsp;&nbsp;accused took &nbsp;the personal belongings of the victims to Balbina Zuniega and Emilia Zuniega, daughters of Hilario Zuniega by his &nbsp;first marriage, who were both &nbsp;staying in &nbsp;the house of Fernando Peritu. &nbsp;The group then &nbsp;went back to the Zuniega house and helped their companions erase all traces of the &nbsp;crime. Afterwards they left the place and went to their respective homes.</p> <p>Almost a year &nbsp;afterwards, or on November &nbsp;24, &nbsp;1953, Lt. Gregorio Hufano, Sgt. Dulay, Sgt. Victoriano C. Tavas, Cpl. &nbsp;Godoy &nbsp;and &nbsp;Pfc. &nbsp;Ramirez of the &nbsp; Philippine Constabulary went to barrio Basca, Aringay, &nbsp;La Union, &nbsp;to investigate &nbsp;the &nbsp;deaths &nbsp;of Hilario Zuniega and Felicisima Peritu. &nbsp;Among those questioned were Sotero Peritu, Sotero &nbsp;Banay, &nbsp;Florentino &nbsp;Estipular, Bernardo &nbsp;Estipular, Andres &nbsp; Balas, &nbsp;Crispulo &nbsp;Mabalo &nbsp;and &nbsp;Florencio &nbsp;Hidalgo. All of them denied knowledge of the &nbsp;crimes. &nbsp;By &nbsp;means of a clever ruse, <sup><font color="#ff0000">[1] </font></sup> however, lay buried. &nbsp;Exhumation was made in the &nbsp;presence of Dr. &nbsp; Viflanueva, &nbsp;the &nbsp;provincial medical &nbsp;officer. &nbsp;In the common grave the investigators found &nbsp;two sets of bones. </p> <p>Written statements &nbsp;were then secured &nbsp;from &nbsp;Andres Balas, Maximo Delinila, Sotero Banay, Sotero &nbsp;Peritu, Florentino Estipular, &nbsp;Bernardo Estipular &nbsp;(Exhibit A, &nbsp;A-l to A-5 respectively, all of which, except A-4, &nbsp;were sworn before Ricardo Ordona, Justice of the Peace &nbsp;of Aringay, La Union); from Fausto Peritu, Ambrosio Belen, Fernando Peritu &nbsp;(Exhs. A-6 to A-8, &nbsp;respectively, &nbsp;sworn &nbsp;before Justice of the Peace &nbsp;Pedro 0. Arciaga of &nbsp;San Fernando, La &nbsp;Union); and from &nbsp;Florencio &nbsp;Hidalgo &nbsp;(Exhibit 1-Peritu). </p> <p>The bones which had been exhumed were placed in four bags &nbsp;(Exhs. &nbsp;B, B-l, &nbsp;B-2 &nbsp;and B-3) &nbsp;and turned over.to Antonio &nbsp;U. Briones, medico-legal officer of Criminal Investigation Service, Philippine &nbsp;Constabulary, &nbsp;who &nbsp;later submitted a written statement of the result of &nbsp;his analysis (Exhibit &nbsp;C). &nbsp;According to his &nbsp;report, the &nbsp;bones &nbsp;were the incomplete skeletons of two human beings, a &nbsp;male (skeleton No. &nbsp;1) &nbsp;and &nbsp;a female (skeleton No. 2); "the individual &nbsp;with &nbsp;skeleton No. 1 must have suffered instantaneous death due to severe shock and hemorrhage secondary to the gunshot wound &nbsp;of the head causing &nbsp;multiple fractures &nbsp;of the skulland severe laceration of the brain; substance," and "multiple fractures &nbsp;of &nbsp;the bones on the right &nbsp;lower side of the face must have been due to heavy blows &nbsp;from a heavy &nbsp;blunt &nbsp;instrument;" and &nbsp; "the cause of death (skeleton No. 2) was also due to shock and hemorrhage secondary to &nbsp;a gunshot wound of the right scapula," &nbsp;and "the &nbsp;sharp instrument &nbsp;employed penetrated' the &nbsp;scapula, and further caused injury to the 4th rib and probably to the &nbsp;right &nbsp;lung." </p> <p>With above facts providing the framework, the prosecution &nbsp;built a case &nbsp;against &nbsp;the ten appellants. &nbsp;Evidence was submitted &nbsp;to prove that &nbsp;their &nbsp;criminal participation was voluntary and in pursuance of &nbsp;a preconceived plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, while all of them profess to have acted under intimidation, they are not &nbsp;agreed as to who exerted it. &nbsp;Some aver that Mabalo and Hidalgo had threatened to kill them and their families if they did not &nbsp;help in the commission of the &nbsp;murders. &nbsp;This group consists of the &nbsp; three Peritus, &nbsp;the &nbsp;two Estipulars &nbsp;(the brothers &nbsp;&nbsp;Florentino &nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;Bernardo). &nbsp;Andres &nbsp;Balas, Sotero &nbsp;Banay and &nbsp;Maximo &nbsp;Dalinila. &nbsp;The other &nbsp;group, composed only of Crispulo Mabalo and Florencio Hidalgo, alleges that it was Andres Balas who mastermineded the plot to kill &nbsp;the Zuniegas, &nbsp;and who, &nbsp;together &nbsp;with &nbsp;the rest of the accused, threatened Mabalo and &nbsp;Hidalgo &nbsp;to give their assistance.</p> <p>As proof &nbsp;of &nbsp;conspiracy &nbsp;and deliberate participation of all the accused, the prosecution points to the testimony of &nbsp;Ambrosio &nbsp;Belen &nbsp;and the sworn written statements signed by the appellants.</p> <p>It appears from six of these statements (Exhs. A, &nbsp;A-l to A-5)<sup><font color="#ff0000">[2] </font></sup>&nbsp;that &nbsp;on December 6, 1952 all the appellants met at a place near &nbsp;the house of Crispulo Mabalo. &nbsp;There Mabalo informed them that the previous night &nbsp;he &nbsp;and a certain &nbsp;Josenna Peritu had been kidnapped by &nbsp;two &nbsp;persons, one of whom &nbsp;he recognized to be &nbsp;Hilario Zuniega, and &nbsp;convinced them that if Zuniega was not killed they would also be in danger of kidnapping.</p> <p>Ambrosio Belen was not present during the meeting, but it seems that Mabalo chose him as the triggerman. What Belen testified to was as to what happened on December 9, 1952. &nbsp;He declared: &nbsp;At four in the &nbsp;afternoon of said day Mabalo, armed with a bolo, went to see &nbsp;him at Ms house in barrio Sili, Naguilian, La Union, and took him to Mabalo's house &nbsp;in barrio &nbsp;&nbsp; Basca, &nbsp;Aringay, &nbsp;La Union, where they found Mabalo's wife preparing supper. Mabalo then left the house and was out for some time. Upon his return they ate supper, after which Mabalo took Belen to the house of Florencio Hidalgo, where they found the three Peritus, the two Estipulars, Delinila, &nbsp;Hidalgo, Balas and Banay. &nbsp;After eating there, all of them went to a place southeast of Banay's house. &nbsp;He obeyed Mabalo, Belen said, because Mabalo, who had a gun, threatened to to kill him. &nbsp;A few meters before they reached the house near &nbsp;the brook, &nbsp;Mabalo handed &nbsp; him &nbsp;a rifle. &nbsp;On going inside the house with Mabalo, he saw &nbsp;sleeping side by side an &nbsp;old man and a woman, who &nbsp;he &nbsp;later learned were Hilario Zuniega and his wife Felicisima Peritu. &nbsp;Because he was afraid of Mabalo, he shot and killed the old man, &nbsp;while Mabalo in turn shot the woman so she would not live &nbsp;to identify them. &nbsp;In compliance with &nbsp;Mabalo's order, Belen called &nbsp;their companions &nbsp;who &nbsp;were waiting by the creek. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mabalo told some of them to dig a grave and bury the &nbsp;victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;Belen &nbsp;did not &nbsp;help inter them, but left &nbsp;shortly after the killing. &nbsp;On his &nbsp;way &nbsp;home to barrio Sili, he &nbsp;threw the murder gun &nbsp;into &nbsp;a river which he had to cross.</p> <p>While &nbsp;from the testimony of Belen it appears that Mabalo and Hidalgo were largely responsible for the killings, Hidalgo insists he was threatened by both Ambrosio Belen and Andres Balas, and &nbsp; Mabalo avers it was Belen &nbsp;who threatened him.</p> <p>Hidalgo testified: In the evening of December 9, 1952, when &nbsp;he was already sleeping, the three Peritus—Fausto, Fernando and Sotero—came to his &nbsp;house, woke him up and told &nbsp;him that Andres Balas &nbsp;needed his &nbsp;help &nbsp;in recovering &nbsp;Balas' carabao, which, according to the three, had fallen from a precipice. &nbsp;&nbsp;When he went with them, however, they took him &nbsp;to the house of Zuniega, where he saw the corpses of Zuniega and his wife. &nbsp;&nbsp; The &nbsp;fact that &nbsp;Balas &nbsp;and &nbsp;Belen &nbsp;were both armed so scared &nbsp;him, Hidalgo &nbsp;said, that he did not inquire into the &nbsp;cause of their deaths. &nbsp;In compliance &nbsp;with orders from Fernando Peritu, &nbsp;Fausto Peritu and Balas, he helped them carry the two corpses from the house. &nbsp;Then &nbsp;they dug a pit, placed &nbsp;the bodies inside and &nbsp; covered them with a bloodstained mat and then with earth. On the ,way from the grave back to the Zuniega house, he saw &nbsp;Mabalo sitting on a dike, but they did not talk to each other. </p> <p>Mabalo testified: &nbsp;On the &nbsp;night &nbsp;in question &nbsp;he was awakened by the shouts of Belen, who &nbsp;asked him to come down because they were going somewhere. &nbsp;At &nbsp;first he refused, reasoning out that he was tired, &nbsp;but Belen threatened him with a gun, so he went along. &nbsp;He recognized Maximo Delinila among Belen's companions. &nbsp;They passed for Sotero Banay and Andres Balas, after which they went &nbsp;westward &nbsp;to the &nbsp;house of Hilario Zuniega. &nbsp; Upon Belen's orders he, Banay and some of the others remained by the brook, some twenty meters from the house, while Belen, &nbsp;Balas and Delinila went towards &nbsp;the road leading to the Zuniega place. &nbsp;&nbsp;The house being on a higher elevation than the brook, Mabalo saw a flashlight illuminate the front of the house, and &nbsp;a moment later heard &nbsp;three gunshots &nbsp;fired by &nbsp;Belen, who was then standing in front of the door. &nbsp;Belen &nbsp;called &nbsp;to him &nbsp;and his companions waiting by &nbsp;the brook, but Mabalo &nbsp;did &nbsp;not budge from his place and stayed there for four hours, during which time he saw the light move &nbsp;inside the &nbsp;house and heard the commotion &nbsp;going on there. &nbsp;He &nbsp;saw Belen, &nbsp;Balas, Banay and &nbsp;Delinila carry out the dead Zuniega and, a little later, Felicisima. &nbsp;Belen told him to wait on top of a dike and watch for persons who might unexpectedly come, so he sat on the dike for &nbsp;about three hours. &nbsp;It was already &nbsp;dawn of the next day before Belen let him go home, warning him not to "squeal" or he would be killed.</p> <p>The eight &nbsp;other &nbsp;appellants present &nbsp;the &nbsp;defense &nbsp;that they &nbsp;helped bury the &nbsp;victims &nbsp;and dispose of &nbsp;their &nbsp;belonging because of &nbsp;threats made by &nbsp;Belen, Mabalo and Hidalgo. &nbsp;The aggregate of their testimony &nbsp;is to the following, effect: In the early evening of December 9, 1952 Hidalgo came to fetch Fausto Peritu from his &nbsp; house &nbsp;at barrio &nbsp;Basca. &nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hidalgo &nbsp;told &nbsp;him &nbsp;there was a P.C. lieutenant waiting for him in Hidalgo's house, Fausto went with Hidalgo. &nbsp;On the way, they passed for his son Fernando Peritu. &nbsp;However, they failed to find &nbsp;any P.C. lieutenant &nbsp; in Hidalgo's house. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hidalgo asked &nbsp;them &nbsp;to wait &nbsp;a while, so they sat in the yard &nbsp;after Hidalgo had lighted a lamp and placed it on top of a &nbsp;mortar. </p> <p>At about the &nbsp;same time Mabalo and &nbsp;Belen were rounding &nbsp;up &nbsp;the &nbsp;other &nbsp;appellants. &nbsp;First, &nbsp;they &nbsp;went to the house of Sotero Peritu, whom Mabalo woke up. Sotero went with the two because Mabalo threatened him with death. &nbsp;Then they &nbsp;proceeded &nbsp;to &nbsp;the houses of &nbsp;Bernardo Estipular, &nbsp;Florentino &nbsp;Estipular, &nbsp;Delinila and Balas, &nbsp;in that order. &nbsp;&nbsp;In &nbsp;each &nbsp;place, &nbsp;Mabalo made his companions wait &nbsp;in the yard while he threatened &nbsp;each &nbsp;appellant into joining the &nbsp;group. &nbsp;Mabalo took them to the &nbsp;house &nbsp;of Hidalgo, who was there waiting &nbsp;with Fausto Peritu and Fernando Peritu. &nbsp;Mabalo &nbsp;ordered &nbsp;Hidalgo, &nbsp;his cousinin-law, to &nbsp; bring his &nbsp;companions &nbsp;along and &nbsp;instructed Belen &nbsp;to watch &nbsp;the seven of them and to shoot &nbsp;any one of them who would attempt to escape. &nbsp;The group, headed by Mabalo, &nbsp;passed for &nbsp;Sotero Banay, &nbsp;whom Mabalo also intimidated into joining them. &nbsp;They went westward until they &nbsp;reached a brook &nbsp;where the eight &nbsp;appellants &nbsp;were made to wait while Belen, &nbsp;Hidalgo and Mabalo went towards the footpath leading to Zuniesra's house. &nbsp;Suddenly, they heard &nbsp;two gunshots coming from the house, &nbsp;after which they heard Belen cursing and shouting at them to come &nbsp;up the house. &nbsp;They &nbsp;were &nbsp;too afraid to move, but a &nbsp;third shot fired by Belen prodded them into going to the Zuniega &nbsp;house. &nbsp;&nbsp;There they &nbsp;saw Belen, Mabalo and Hidalgo, and the dead &nbsp;bodies of &nbsp;Zuniega and his &nbsp;wife. Mabalo ordered &nbsp;the &nbsp;three Peritus &nbsp;and Andres &nbsp;Balas &nbsp;to dir a &nbsp;grave. &nbsp;Hidalgo &nbsp;handed to them &nbsp;a shovel and &nbsp;a crowbar &nbsp;for &nbsp;that purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;These four appellants, &nbsp;after digging the grave, then interred &nbsp;the victims, while Hidalgo held a lamp and Belen pointed &nbsp;a gun at them. </p> <p>In the meantime, Mabalo ordered Delinila, Banay and the two &nbsp;Estipulars to take the victims personal belongings to the house of Fernando Peritu, &nbsp;where Zuniega's two daughters, Emilia and Balbina, were staying. &nbsp;These four appellants waited &nbsp;downstairs while Mabalo went up the house and apprised Zuniega's daughters of the &nbsp;death &nbsp;of their father and stepmother. &nbsp; At Mabalo's &nbsp;orders these four appellants brought &nbsp;up the &nbsp;personal belongings &nbsp;of the &nbsp;victims. &nbsp;Before &nbsp;leaving the &nbsp;house Mabalo &nbsp;warned Emilia and &nbsp; Balbina not to talk about his having &nbsp;killed their father. &nbsp;Back at Zuniega's house Mabalo &nbsp;ordered Delinila, Banay and the Estipulars to help Balas and the three Peritus, &nbsp;who were &nbsp;washing the gore &nbsp;off &nbsp;the floor of the house. &nbsp;After they finished, Mabalo allowed them to go home, warning them not to &nbsp;report to the authorities. </p> <p>Since &nbsp;appellants admit &nbsp;their presence &nbsp;at &nbsp;and &nbsp;participation in &nbsp; the commission of the crimes, &nbsp;the only issue is whether or not the same was voluntary, deliberate and in pursuance &nbsp;of a &nbsp;criminal conspiracy. &nbsp;In view of the conflicting theories presented by the two groups &nbsp;of &nbsp;appellants, &nbsp;it is apparent that either &nbsp;or &nbsp; both &nbsp;must &nbsp;be false.</p> <p>Let &nbsp;us consider the &nbsp;version given &nbsp;by Mabalo and Hidalgo. &nbsp;&nbsp;To support Mabalo's defense, &nbsp;Hidalgo alleged that he saw Mabalo sitting on &nbsp;a dike &nbsp;and even talked to him. But shortly thereafter he contradicted himself by &nbsp;declaring that he never &nbsp; talked &nbsp;to &nbsp;Mabalo, his cousin-in-law, &nbsp;although he passed quite close to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;And while Mabalo testified that he never saw Hidalgo, the latter claimed that he saw the former three times during the night in question—first, &nbsp;before the Peritus come to fetch him, he saw Mabalo &nbsp;sitting on &nbsp;a &nbsp;dike under the acacia &nbsp;tree near Zuniega's house; &nbsp;next &nbsp;he &nbsp;saw &nbsp;Mabalo on the same dike when &nbsp;he and the &nbsp;Peritus &nbsp;came from &nbsp;his house &nbsp;and were going to Zuniega's house; and then &nbsp;he saw Mabalo still sitting on the &nbsp;dike when they returned for Felicisima's corpse. &nbsp;&nbsp;From what Hidalgo stated it would appear that Mabalo &nbsp;remained seated on the dike &nbsp;all the &nbsp;time, &nbsp;but Mabalo declared that &nbsp;he first waited by the brook &nbsp;and it was &nbsp;only &nbsp; when &nbsp;Felicisima's corpse was being carried from the house &nbsp;that Belen ordered him to stay on &nbsp;the dike. &nbsp;Belen &nbsp;would hardly have taken the trouble of &nbsp;fetching him from his &nbsp;house only to ask &nbsp;him to do nothing but stay near the creek and then sit on a dike, as if just to have an eyewitness to the burial of &nbsp;the victims. </p> <p>To show that Belen &nbsp;could not have eaten supper at Mabalo's house, the latter's wife, &nbsp; Concepcion, declared that on &nbsp;the &nbsp;night in question she was &nbsp;too sick &nbsp;to &nbsp; stand &nbsp;up, much less cook supper. &nbsp;&nbsp;If she were really that ill, it was unlikely that Mabalo would leave her alone in &nbsp;the &nbsp;house the &nbsp;whole night without &nbsp;even &nbsp; telling her &nbsp;that he was going out and where. &nbsp;He could have used her illness as an excuse &nbsp;for not going with Belen, there being no one &nbsp;else who could stay with her. &nbsp;Yet he did not even tell &nbsp;Belen that his wife was sick. &nbsp;Instead, his reason for refusing, at first, to go with Belen, was that he was very tired. </p> <p>Mabalo said he &nbsp;did not inform &nbsp;his &nbsp;wife that he was going out with Belen, &nbsp;and even upon his return gave &nbsp;her no &nbsp;explanation for having stayed out &nbsp;the &nbsp;whole &nbsp;night. This is quite incredible. &nbsp;She must have known beforehand where &nbsp;he was &nbsp; going, &nbsp;the idea &nbsp;for &nbsp;the murders having &nbsp;been &nbsp;hatched at the house three days before they were committed.</p> <p>As regards Hidalgo, it is noteworthy &nbsp;that in his &nbsp;sworn statement, Exhibit 1Peritus, he claimed it was Andres Balas who woke him up and persuaded him to go with Andres and &nbsp;the &nbsp; three Peritus; and that while they were already on their way to Zuniega's house he heard three shots. On the witness stand, &nbsp;however, he &nbsp;declared that it was &nbsp;only the three Peritus who came for him and took him to &nbsp;Zuniega's house, &nbsp;where he found Zuniega and his wife already dead.</p> <p>Ambrosio Belen's testimony clearly shows that Mabalo and Hidalgo were the main instigators of &nbsp; the &nbsp;plot. &nbsp;It was at Hidalgo's house that &nbsp;all the other &nbsp;appellants met preparatory to their going to Zuniega's house to execute the agreed &nbsp;plan. &nbsp;The &nbsp; appellants &nbsp;are &nbsp;there, so Hidalgo must &nbsp;have &nbsp;seen &nbsp;to &nbsp;it that &nbsp; enough &nbsp;food &nbsp;was &nbsp;prepared. This indicates, beyond peradventure of &nbsp;doubt, that he had foreknowledge of the plot. &nbsp;Mabalo was &nbsp;the &nbsp;one &nbsp;who secured the &nbsp; presence of the chosen triggerman, &nbsp;Belen, at the proper time, &nbsp;even going to the &nbsp; extent of fetching Belen from barrio &nbsp;Sili. &nbsp;Mabalo was the &nbsp;one who killed Felicisima &nbsp;Peritu. &nbsp;Her wounds more or less tallied &nbsp;with Belen's statement that Mabalo was &nbsp; armed with a bolo when he came to barrio &nbsp;Sili in the &nbsp;afternoon before the murders. &nbsp;&nbsp;For she sustained not &nbsp;only &nbsp;a gunshot wound (on &nbsp;the &nbsp;collarbone) but &nbsp;also one &nbsp;inflicted with a sharp instrument, which penetrated the &nbsp;scapula and injured the fourth rib &nbsp;and probably the lung. &nbsp;Also, as proven &nbsp;by testimony of &nbsp;Emilia &nbsp;Zuniega, who testified for the &nbsp;other defendants, Mabalo headed the &nbsp;group which brought her father's and stepmother's personal belongings to her and her sister &nbsp;Balbina.</p> <p>There is no reason for doubting Belen. &nbsp;No &nbsp;improper motive has been attributed to &nbsp; him. &nbsp;If he had been prejudiced at all it should &nbsp;have been against the other appellants, not &nbsp;against Mabalo whom he knew very &nbsp;well. Belen used to work in Mabalo's fields &nbsp;and had even boarded with him &nbsp;during harvest time. &nbsp;On the &nbsp;other &nbsp;hand, he seems to have been barely familiar &nbsp;with &nbsp;the other &nbsp;eight appellants.</p> <p>Furthermore, other than for the fact that Mabalo asked him to kill Zuniega, Belen had no reason to wish Zuniega dead. &nbsp;Mabalo on the other hand, had such motive. &nbsp;He believed that Zuniega was responsible for &nbsp;his having been kidnapped together with Josefina Peritu. &nbsp;In addition to this, &nbsp;as testified by Emilia Zuniega, Mabalo had quarrelled with &nbsp;her &nbsp;father about &nbsp;the &nbsp;use of &nbsp;water for irrigation purposes. &nbsp;In &nbsp;his &nbsp;plot he included not only Hidalgo, his cousin-in-law, &nbsp;but &nbsp;aJso the other eight appellants who also had reasons for joining the conspiracy.. Besides Mabalo's statement to them that they might also &nbsp;be kidnapped by Zuniega, they had their &nbsp;own &nbsp;individual &nbsp;motives. &nbsp;&nbsp; Josefina Peritu, &nbsp;who had been kidnapped with Mabalo, &nbsp;is the daughter of Fausto &nbsp;Peritu and the sister &nbsp;of Fernando Peritu &nbsp;and &nbsp;Sotero Peritu. &nbsp;Andres Balas, Florentino Estipular &nbsp;and &nbsp;Maximo &nbsp;Delinila &nbsp;bore &nbsp;a &nbsp;grudge against Hilario Zuniega because he prevented them from measuring the property they had bought from Hilario's son, Alvaro, which property adjoined &nbsp;that of Hilario. &nbsp;Bernardo Estipular was &nbsp;involved &nbsp;because of his brother &nbsp;Florentino, while Sotero &nbsp;Banay joined the &nbsp;plea because of his uncle Hidalgo.</p> <p>For objective reasons the version of the eight appellants (except Hidalgo &nbsp;and Mabalo) must likewise be rejected. Belen affirmed that when he and Mabalo arrived &nbsp;at Hidalgo's &nbsp;house &nbsp;they found &nbsp;said &nbsp;appellants &nbsp;already &nbsp;there.<br> This disproves their assertion &nbsp;that &nbsp;it &nbsp;was Mabalo who rounded them up &nbsp;one by &nbsp;one from their house. &nbsp;Considering that &nbsp;barrio Basca &nbsp;(and &nbsp;the surrounding area) &nbsp;is mountainous, &nbsp;&nbsp;inaccessible &nbsp;except &nbsp;by foot, &nbsp;and sparsely populated, &nbsp; with &nbsp;the houses &nbsp;of the &nbsp;eight &nbsp;appellants &nbsp;far apart from each &nbsp;other, <sup><font color="#ff0000">[3]</font></sup> it would have &nbsp;taken Belen and Mabalo the greater part of the night to recruit each appellant from &nbsp;his &nbsp;house. &nbsp;It is &nbsp;more &nbsp; reasonable to &nbsp;believe Belen's statement that they all gathered together &nbsp;volunr shile Hidalgo's house was three kilometers from &nbsp;Fausto Peritu's house. It is more reasonable to believe Belen's statement that they all gathered voluntarily at Hidalgo's place and even ate supper there. &nbsp;&nbsp;This fact indicates a pre-arranged plan. &nbsp;If, as may be inferred from the story of &nbsp;these eight appellants, &nbsp;Belen, &nbsp;Mabalo and Hidalgo merely needed help &nbsp;to &nbsp; bury the victims and dispose of their belongings, they would &nbsp;hardly have &nbsp;gone to the extent of intimidating as &nbsp;many &nbsp;as eight unwilling helpers when half the &nbsp;number, or even less, &nbsp;would &nbsp;have sufficed for the purpose. &nbsp;The more people they threatened, the &nbsp;less effective would be the threat and the more witnesses there would &nbsp;be to the crimes, and hence the greater danger of discovery &nbsp;and apprehension. &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;only logical and credible explanation is &nbsp;that all the appellants &nbsp;were moved &nbsp;by a common sentiment &nbsp;and acted &nbsp;in &nbsp;accordance with a pre-arranged plan. &nbsp;This is the only explanation for &nbsp;the fact that &nbsp;although &nbsp;they were &nbsp;left by the creek, with nobody watching them, &nbsp;they made no &nbsp;attempt to &nbsp;escape, for they were there to stand guard and to help bury the victims after the &nbsp;killing.</p> <p>The &nbsp;acts &nbsp;of &nbsp;the eight appellants &nbsp;(except Hidalgo and Mabalo) &nbsp;in &nbsp; voluntarily &nbsp;meeting at Hidalgo's house; their standing watch by the creek; their helping &nbsp;to bury &nbsp;the bodies &nbsp;of the victims; their cooperating to &nbsp;dispose &nbsp;of &nbsp;the latter's belongings &nbsp;and their erasing &nbsp;all &nbsp;traces of &nbsp;the crimes, prove that they had &nbsp;conspired with &nbsp;Mabalo and Hidalgo.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Conspiracies need &nbsp;not be established by direct evidence of the acts charged, but may &nbsp;and generally must be proved by &nbsp;a number &nbsp;of &nbsp;indefinite acts, &nbsp; conditions and &nbsp;circumstances &nbsp;which vary according to &nbsp;the purpose to be accomplished. The &nbsp;very &nbsp;existence of a conspiracy &nbsp;is generally a matter of inference deduced from certain acts &nbsp;of the persons accused, &nbsp;done in pursuance &nbsp;of an apparently criminal or &nbsp;unlawful purpose in common &nbsp;between them. The existence of the &nbsp;agreement or joint assent of the minds need not, be proved directly. &nbsp;It may be inferred by the jury from other facts proved. It is not necessary to prove that the defendants came together and actually agreed in &nbsp;terms to have the unlawful &nbsp;purpose, and to pursue &nbsp;it by common &nbsp;means.<em> If&nbsp;&nbsp;it be proved &nbsp;that the defendants &nbsp;pursued by their acts the &nbsp;same object, often by the same means, one performing one part &nbsp;and &nbsp;another &nbsp;part of the &nbsp;same so as to &nbsp;complete it, with a view to the &nbsp;attainment of the &nbsp;same &nbsp;object, the &nbsp;jury will be justified &nbsp;in the conclusion that they were engaged &nbsp;in a conspiracy to effect &nbsp;that object.</em> &nbsp;If, therefore, one concurs in a conspiracy, no proof of agreement to concur is necessary in order &nbsp;to make him guilty. His participation in the conspiracy may be &nbsp;established without showing his name or giving his &nbsp;description. &nbsp;People vs. Colman, &nbsp;L-6652 to &nbsp;6654, February 28, 1958.</p> </blockquote> <p>Furthermore, we have the sworn statements made by all &nbsp;eight &nbsp;appellants &nbsp;(Exhibits &nbsp;A, A-l to A-6 and A-8) all &nbsp;of which, except those of Fausto and &nbsp; Fernando Peritu are self-incriminating. &nbsp;Appellants now assail their sworn statements on two &nbsp;grounds; (1) that they are inadmissible as &nbsp;evidence &nbsp;because they were signed under threat and intimidation and without affiant's knowledge of their contents ; and (2) that the prosecution failed to &nbsp;establish the requisites so that each statement may &nbsp;be &nbsp;used against the other appellant who were not signers thereof. </p> <p>Let us consider the first objectives. &nbsp;&nbsp;Appellants declared that they were subjected to maltreatment by certain constabulary &nbsp;soldiers &nbsp;in &nbsp;order &nbsp;to &nbsp;force &nbsp; them &nbsp;to sign the affidavits: &nbsp;Andres Balas &nbsp;said &nbsp;he was thrice ordered to "squats &nbsp;on air" &nbsp;and kicked &nbsp;on the left side. &nbsp;Florentino Estipular said that for two hours, which his body &nbsp;bent at &nbsp;the wai3t as &nbsp;he was made to hold his ankles with his hands he was required to stay &nbsp;under the sun. &nbsp;Bernardo Estipular testified that with arms outstretched he was made made to kneel on pebbles for thirty minutes and that whenever he fell he &nbsp;was hit &nbsp;on the &nbsp;knees and arms. &nbsp;Sotero Banay had to stand on tiptoe for thirty minutes, also with arms outstretched. &nbsp;Fernando &nbsp;Peritu &nbsp;was boxed, then hit on the left ear so &nbsp;that he fell unconscious. &nbsp;Sotero Peritu was also made &nbsp;to squat &nbsp;and was given fist &nbsp;blows three times by Sgt. Tavas. &nbsp;Fausto Peritu was also made &nbsp;to "squat on air" for two hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;Maximo Delinila said that for about thirty minutes &nbsp;he was &nbsp; made to bend and hold a &nbsp;bottle &nbsp;placed &nbsp;on the floor, while turning clockwise &nbsp;at the same time.</p> <p>Appellant's &nbsp;story &nbsp;of maltreatment must be &nbsp;discarded. They said &nbsp;they were &nbsp;investigated &nbsp;not inside the &nbsp;schoolbuilding of Basca but in the schoolyard, a space open to public view. &nbsp;The spectacle of men being subjected to the interesting &nbsp;"tortures" described by &nbsp;appellants &nbsp;certainly would &nbsp;have attracted &nbsp;the &nbsp;attention not only of their relatives but &nbsp;also &nbsp;of other barrio folk. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not a single witness was presented to corroborate appellant's story.</p> <p>The &nbsp;P.C. &nbsp;men &nbsp;who investigated appellants categorically declared that they did not maltreat or threaten &nbsp;the appellants. &nbsp;Ricardo Ordona &nbsp;and &nbsp;Pedro Arciaga, the justices of the peace before whom appellants &nbsp;appeared, &nbsp;testified that appellants &nbsp; voluntarily &nbsp;swore to &nbsp;their &nbsp;statements after the same had &nbsp;been read and translated &nbsp;to them. Each of the statements contains &nbsp;details which only the affiant thereof could have known. &nbsp;In the case of Fernando Peritu and Fausto &nbsp;Peritu, &nbsp;their &nbsp; respective &nbsp;statements contain practically nothing incriminatory, the same being more or less similar to &nbsp;those they made in court. &nbsp;It is unreasonable to &nbsp;think that the P.C. &nbsp; men &nbsp;would &nbsp;employ intimidation only to &nbsp;obtain from &nbsp;these two the kind of statements &nbsp;they &nbsp;actually made. &nbsp;And while some of the appellants claimed to have been physically assaulted, &nbsp;none appears &nbsp;to &nbsp;have &nbsp;complained to the &nbsp;proper authorities, nor is &nbsp;there any &nbsp;medical certificate attesting to whatever injuries &nbsp;they &nbsp;may have suffered.</p> <p>In their &nbsp;respective sworn statements, appellants Balas (Exh. A); Delinila (Exh. A-1); Sotero Banay (Exh. A-2); Sotero Peritu &nbsp;(Exh. &nbsp;A-3); &nbsp;Florentino Estipular &nbsp;(Exh. A-4); &nbsp;and &nbsp;Bernardo Estipular (Exh. &nbsp;A-5) alleged that three &nbsp;days before &nbsp;the &nbsp;murders &nbsp;were committed &nbsp;there was a &nbsp;meeting under the santol tree in the yard of &nbsp;Crispulo Mabalo; &nbsp;and they &nbsp;admitted &nbsp;that they took &nbsp;part in the discussion &nbsp;of the &nbsp;plan to kill &nbsp;Zuniega and his &nbsp;wife. While &nbsp;some declared in their statements that &nbsp;they &nbsp;were somewhat &nbsp;reluctant,, nonetheless &nbsp;they were finally persuaded &nbsp;into &nbsp;taking part &nbsp;in the plot. &nbsp;&nbsp;These individual admissions are binding on the respective affiants and show beyond &nbsp;doubt their &nbsp;complicity in the &nbsp; plot. &nbsp;As &nbsp;for &nbsp;Fernando Peritu, &nbsp;Fausto Peritu, &nbsp;Crispulo &nbsp;Mabalo &nbsp; and Florencio Hidalgo, their actions, as already related, &nbsp;prove their participation in the conspiracy beyond doubt. &nbsp;&nbsp;Conspiracy having been &nbsp;established, each of &nbsp;the statements (Exh. A, A-l to A-5) is admissible against all &nbsp;the conspirators, and each is responsible for the crimes committed as a result.</p> <p>The Solicitor General, on the ground that the aggravating circumstances &nbsp;of evident &nbsp; premeditation, &nbsp;superior strength &nbsp;and &nbsp;dwelling attended the &nbsp;commission &nbsp;of the crimes, recommends the imposition of the death penalty and the increase &nbsp;of the &nbsp;civil indemnity &nbsp;from &nbsp;P6,000.00 for the two &nbsp;victims to P6,000.00 for each of them. &nbsp;The aggravating &nbsp;circumstance of abuse of superior strength is absorbed by the &nbsp;qualifying &nbsp; circumstance &nbsp;of &nbsp;treachery (People vs. &nbsp;Guarnes, 110 Phil., 379.) &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;existence of conspiracy presupposes evident premeditation (People <i>vs.</i> Timbang and Mallarin, 74 Phil. 295), which, together with the circumstance of dwelling, should be appreciated against appellants. &nbsp;However, the death &nbsp;penalty should not be imposed since they have not shown that degree of perversity that &nbsp;would &nbsp;justify imposition thereof. &nbsp;Nevertheless the death indemnity should be &nbsp;raised &nbsp;to P6,000.00 for each victim &nbsp;(People <i>vs.</i> &nbsp;Davis, 111 Phil. 67).</p> <p>Wherefore, modified only with respect to the indemnity, which should be in the sum of &nbsp; P6,000.00 to the heirs of each of the two victims, &nbsp;the judgment appealed from &nbsp;is affirmed, with costs.</p> <p><em>Bengzon, &nbsp;C. J., Padillla, &nbsp;Bautista &nbsp;Angelo, &nbsp;Labrador, Concepcion, &nbsp;&nbsp;Barrera, &nbsp;Paredes, &nbsp;Dizon </em>and <em>Regala, JJ.</em> concur.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <font color="#ff0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> Lt.

Florentino &nbsp;Estipular's &nbsp;house was &nbsp;one kilor meter from Zuniega's house, while Hidalgo's house was one kilometers from Fausto Peritu'shouse.</p> </div>
