				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">No greater responsibility devolves upon a member of the bar than that
of living up to its high and exacting standards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure on his part to do so, when called to
our attention and upon a showing that such indeed was the case, entails conse­quences
far from pleasant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is as is but just
and proper, held accountable; whatever disciplinary measure is warranted is
imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, while this
Court carefully looks into and scrutinizes every complaint for misconduct, it
never displays any hesitancy to clear the respondent before it from any
unjustified charge or undeserved imputation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the least that can be done to remedy matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stain on his good name must be removed,
the blot on his record erased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
justice requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it must be in this
proceeding against re­spondent Tomas B. <span class="SpellE">Matol</span>, a
member of the Philippine Bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the petition for
disbarment filed by the complainant, <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span> C.
Aragon, on August 22, 1969, it was alleged that she retained his services as
her counsel in a civil case for damages, entitled <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span>
Aragon v. Perfecto de la Rosa &amp; <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
Acosta,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> filed with the Court of First Instance of
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>; that on October 21, 1964, such a
court promulgated an order dismissing the above case, </span>a <span style="">copy of which order was received by
respondent as such counsel; that, notwithstanding the lapse of time from the
receipt of such order of dismissal, complainant allegedly even periodically
inquiring from respondent <span class="SpellE">Matol</span> about the status of
her case from 1964 to the early part of 1969, she was never informed thereof;
that on July 7, 1969, she did secure a copy of such order of dismissal from the
Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>;
that there was an admission by respondent of his having received a copy of the
1964 order and </span>a <span style="">failure to
advance a reasonable explanation for such omission to inform her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition prayed for the investigation,
"and, if the evidence warrants, that he be removed from the Roll of
Attorneys.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Tomas B. <span class="SpellE">Matol</span>, having been
required to answer by virtue of our resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1969</st1:date>, did fully file the same on September 9 of
this year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After admitting that he is a
member of the Philippine Bar, having passed the bar examination and having been
admitted in the practice of law in 1962, and that his services were in fact
retained as counsel for complainant in the case for damages then pending with
the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> which
was dismissed by the order of October 21, 1964, as alleged in the petition, he
denied the truth of the imputation that he failed to notify complainant of such
dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">What happened, according to him, was that a copy of such order
was immediately sent, upon the receipt thereof, to peti­tioner at 1230 Juan
Luna Street, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, by registered mail,
attaching to his answer the duplicate original of his letter to complainant
wherein he informed her that he received, on the morning of October 26, 1964,
such an order, and that he was sending a copy to her asking her at the same
time whether she would like to have him take the steps for the reconsideration
there­of, likewise attaching as part of his answer the registry receipt return
card No. 7351 which would indicate that either petitioner or someone in her
house did receive such letter on October 30, 1964.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He further stated that even before such promulgation of the order of dismissal
of October 21, 1964, complainant did she his wife at their residence in <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, re­spondent
being at the time in San Jose, Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> for
the purpose of getting all the records of such case, alleging that she would
seek the legal assistance of "one of her lawyers." His wife's request
to wait for him not being heeded by complainant, she did deliver to her all of
such records of that particular case, complainant issuing a receipt, attached
to the answer, of the following tenor:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"I [hereby] certify that I received from Atty. Tomas B. <span class="SpellE">Matol</span> the records of Civil Case No. 1040 Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castillo vs. De La Rosa for transfer to one
of my lawyers."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It was dated <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1964</st1:date>
with the place, <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>,
likewise noted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was duly signed <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span> Castillo <st1:country-region><st1:place>Aragon</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the name of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise attached to the answer is a five-page motion for
reconsideration of the aforesaid lower court order of <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1964</st1:date> filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1964</st1:date> on behalf of complainant, as
plaintiff, by her new counsel, Agustin V. <span class="SpellE">Velante</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The answer further noted that on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="12">December
 9, 1964</st1:date> there was an order from the lower court denying such a
motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not to be lost sight of that copies of the answer, with its
annexes as well as a brief memorandum on the part of re­spondent seeking the
dismissal of the complaint against him, were sent to petitioner at her address
at 1230 Juan Luna Street, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila by registered
mail dated September 16, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of
this date, complainant remains unheard from.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such silence on her part is indicative of her inability to assail the
veracity of what was alleged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, likewise, the annexes above referred to consisting of the
duplicate original of the letter inform­ing her about the alleged order, of
which she was notified, dated as far back as October 26, 1964, the registry
return receipt of October 30, 1964, the receipt that she was able as early as
September 2, 1964, to take possession of the <span style="">records of such a </span>case so that she could avail himself of the
services of another counsel, the motion for reconsideration filed by such <span style="">new </span>counsel,
a lawyer from Manila, and the denial of such motion for reconsideration, it
would appear that either out of deficient memory or lack of sufficient respect
for the truth, complainant did impute a misconduct to respondent, of which he
was innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there can be no
other conclusion except that this complaint should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">One last word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
observation is ever timely and is ever apt that great care should be taken by a
client before lodging a complaint for disciplinary action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was so appropriately observed by the great
jurist, <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"A reputation [in the legal profession] is a plant of tender
growth, and its bloom, once lost, is not easily restored."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Very often, the livelihood of a member of the bar depends upon maintaining
intact such a reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally dear
to an advocate is the maintenance of the esteem that the public has for his
probity, his dedication, his conscientiousness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The charge that he is neglectful of his client's interest, even if
unfounded, as in this case, is unfortunately not without its adverse
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is all the more reason,
then, to caution anyone who has availed himself of his services against any
reckless or unfounded accusation, as did occur in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough to affirm that respondent
Tomas B. <span class="SpellE">Matol</span> has not in any wise committed the
malpractice imputed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complainant, <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span> C. Aragon, must be admonished
and cautioned against the repetition of the filing of such a baseless charge
against any member of the bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this complaint for malpractice against Tomas B.
<span class="SpellE">Matol</span>, a member of the Philippine Bar, is hereby
dismissed.</p>
