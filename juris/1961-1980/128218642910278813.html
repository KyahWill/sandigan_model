				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> to have the order of respondent judge of December 28, 1979 ordering petitioner to produce the child, Maria Teresa Unson, his daughter barely eight years of age, with private respondent Edita N. Araneta and return her to the custody of the latter, further obliging petitioner to "continue his support of said daughter by providing for her education and medical needs," allegedly issued without a "hearing" and the reception of testimony in violation of Section 6 of Rule 99.<br><br>Petitioner and private respondent were married on April 19, 1971<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and out of that marriage the child in question, Teresa, was born on December 1, 1971.&nbsp; However, as stated in a decision rendered on August 23, 1974 in Civil Case No. 7716 of respondent judge himself, on July 13, 1974 they executed an agreement for the separation of their properties and to live separately, as they have in fact been living separately since June 1972.&nbsp; The agreement was approved by the Court.<br><br>The parties are agreed that no specific provision was contained in said agreement about the custody of the child because the husband and wife would have their own private arrangement in that respect.&nbsp; Thus, according to the affidavit of petitioner attached to his supplement to petition, submitted in compliance with the directive of this Court during the hearing of this case, he affirms that:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>"(8) That when Maria Teresa started pre­school in 1976 at the Early Learning Center in San Lorenzo, very near petitioner's residence, and later when she started school at Assumption College, Maria Teresa would stay with petitioner during school days and spend weekends with her mother, but there were times when her mother wouldn't even bother to pick her up during non-school days;<br><br>(9) That during the early part of 1978 petitioner personally acquired knowledge that his wife Edita Araneta has been living with her brother-in-law Agustin F. Reyes, in an apartment at C. Palma St., Makati, Metro Manila, and so petitioner tightened his custody over his daughter, especially after:<br><blockquote>a. he found out that Agustin F. Reyes was confined at the Makati Medical Center from October 13 up to December 3, 1977 for "Manic Depressive" under the care of Dr. Baltazar Reyes;<br><br>b. he found out that his wife Edita Araneta delivered a child fathered by Agustin F. Reyes on September 24, 1978.&nbsp; (Please see Birth Certificate attached hereto as Annex "A-1");<br><br>c. he found out that Agustin F. Reyes had been confined again for the same ailment at the Makati Medical Center from June 27 up to August 29, 1978 under the care of the same doctor;</blockquote>(10) That on May 21, 1980 Edita Araneta delivered another child fathered by Agustin F. Reyes.&nbsp; (Please see Birth Certificate attached hereto as Annex "A-2");<br><br>(11) That aside from the foregoing circumstances, the following militate against custody of Maria Teresa in favor of Edita Araneta:<br><blockquote>a. Agustin F. Reyes is the child's godfather/baptismal sponsor;<br><br>b. Agustin F. Reyes and Edita Araneta have left the Roman Catholic Church and have embraced a protestant sect (Please see Annex "A-2" hereof, which lists the occupation of Agustin F. Reyes as a seminarian);</blockquote>(12) That Maria Teresa is almost nine (9) years old, born and reared under the Roman Catholic faith, impressionable, and should not be exposed to an environment alien to the Catholic way of life, which is the upbringing and training petitioner, as her father is committed to;<br><br>(13) That petitioner is executing this affidavit for all legal purposes." (Pp. 81-82 of Record)</blockquote>Upon the other hand, private respondent affirms in her affidavit Annex "A" aforementioned that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td style="text-align: center;" colspan="2">"xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="95%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"6. </td> <td><div align="justify">Since the birth of Maria Teresa, she has always lived with affiant, her mother, who has reared and brought up the child to the best of her ability.
