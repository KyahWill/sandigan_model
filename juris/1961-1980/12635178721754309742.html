<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of a resolution of the
Commission on Elections, hereinafter referred to as COMELEC, dated <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1969</st1:date>, and reading as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"By unanimous vote of the members of the Commission, it hereby
RESOLVES to sustain the action of the Board of Canvassers in including in the
canvass the election returns of the precincts listed in the Manifestation of
counsel for Candidate Moore, dated December 16, 1969, which returns were
physically examined by the Commission during the hearing this afternoon. The
Commission is satisfied, upon examination of these and each of these returns,
that the returns are regular on their face, that the signatures of the boards
of inspectors are regular, and on this basis, the Commission feels that it is
not necessary to go beyond the return.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And since the purpose in the presentation of the affidavits is to
establish by <u>evidence <span class="SpellE">aliunde</span></u> facts to
contradict what appears on the return, the Commission RULES that it is not
necessary to allow or to require the parties to submit the affidavits and
counter-affidavits with re­spect to these particular returns specified in the
Manifestation of Candidate Moore, dated December 16, 1969.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> is hereby directed to desist from proclaiming the
winner for this congressional district until 12:00 Noon of December 26, 1969,
to enable counsel for Candidate Moore to avail of the remedies in court, with
the Supreme Court in particular, to review the rulings of the Commission with
respect to the inclusion in the canvass of these particular returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If by December 26, 1969, 12:00 Noon, no
restraining order is issued by the Supreme Court, the Provincial Board of
Canvassers <u>shall</u> convene to proclaim the winner in accordance with the
result of their canvass following the rulings and instructions of this
Commission in regard to these disputed precincts which have been elevated to
this Commission for review."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of the petition, We required respondents COMELEC,
the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
hereinafter referred to as the Board - and Raul <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>
to file their answer to the petition, as well as issued an order restraining
the proclamation referred to in the aforementioned resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, petitioner filed a
supplemental petition, followed, still later by an amended petition, including
therein the Provincial Treasurer of <st1:place>Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
as one of the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due
course, respondent <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> filed his answer and later a
supplemental answer, admitting some allegations and denying other allegations
of the peti­tion, as well as making affirmative allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that, in the last general elections, held on <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">Novem­ber 11, 1969</st1:date>, petitioner Moore
and respondent <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> were the official candidates of
the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party and the Liberal Party, respect­ively,
for Representative in the lone representative district of Northern <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> and F. <span class="SpellE">Jumadiao</span>
were, likewise, candidates for the same office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On November 18, 1969, the Board convened to canvass the corresponding
returns, but the proceedings were suspended, upon orders of the provincial
supervisor of the COMELEC, the returns for several municipalities not having,
as yet, been received by the provincial treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board reconvened and actually began the
canvass, in the office of the Provincial Governor, at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Capitol</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>, on <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 28, 1969, Moore filed with the COMELEC an
"Urgent Omnibus Petition" (Annex K), praying, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the Board be restrained "from
proceeding with the canvass and/or proclamation, " upon the ground, among
others, that there had been "massive and pervasive fraud and terrorism,
" coupled with "vote-buying, " and a tampering and falsification
of "more than one hundred (100) election returns x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> to unduly increase the votes for LP candidate Raul <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> and insure the railroading of his pro­clamation."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, the COMELEC denied the petition for sus­pension
of the canvass, but ordered the Board to desist from proclaiming the winner
"to enable parties to elevate questions involving spurious returns"
(Annex L).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Board proceeded
with the canvass until its completion on November 30, 1969, on which date all
of its members signed the corresponding statements of "votes by
precinct" (Annexes 9 and 9-A to 9-T) and a certificate of votes by
municipality (Annex 10), showing that <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> and Moore
had obtained a total of 28,940 votes and 28,481 votes, respectively, and that,
accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> had been elected by a plurality of
459 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 3, <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> filed, therefore,
with the COMELEC, an "Urgent Petition to Lift Suspension of
Proclamation" (An­nex M), which was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to this date, or on December 12, 1969,
Moore had filed, with the COMELEC, a petition (Annex P) seeking, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, a declaration of nullity of all proceedings
before the Board, subsequently to the alleged exclusion of his watchers
"from the canvassing, " through threats, and the "rejection of
the election returns" for the follow­ing precincts - "for being
obviously false, spurious, falsified and/or fabricated" - upon the grounds
stated after each:</p>

reconsideration, which was not entertained by the COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 23, 1969, Moore filed with the
COMELEC his notice of appeal and, on December 24, 1969, docketed in the Supreme
Court his present petition for review, upon the ground that the COMELEC had
denied him due process and committed a grave abuse of discretion in denying his
aforesaid motion for post­ponement of the hearing from December 18 to December
27, 1969, and in issuing the resolution Annex A.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful review of the records, We are fully satisfied that
the petition herein is untenable.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>
alleges that three (3) days - from December 15 to <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1969</st1:date> - were too short a time for him to
gather affi­davits in <st1:place>Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
and present them before the COMELEC in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however, that the
petition (Annex P) sought to be supported by said affidavits, had been filed on
<st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1969</st1:date>, so that
he had had not less than six (6) days <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>, and
that he was supposed to have evidence to establish the allegations of said
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, said allegations
were, to all intents, a reiteration of those made in his "Urgent Omnibus
Petition" (Annex K), filed with the COMELEC on <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1969</st1:date>, in which he averred that more
than 100 election returns had been tampered with or falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From November 28, to <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1969</st1:date>, <st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>
had had 20 days within which to obtain the aforementioned affidavits and have
them brought to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on or before
<st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, out of the 37 affidavits filed by
him with the Supreme Court, on January 17, 1970, thirty-one (31) - Annexes T-1,
T-4 to T-13, T-15 to T-18, T-20 to T-23, and T-25 to T-36 - had been subscribed
and sworn to <u>on or before November 28, 1969</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>
has not explained satisfactorily why he did not produce these affidavits before
the COMELEC on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The excuse given by him, to the effect that
there had been no plane flights from Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
to Manila on December 16 and 17 - which, even if true, is not plausible - has
been proven to be false.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioner maintained, in his petition Annex
P, that the twenty-five (25) election returns above enumerated should not be
included in the canvass, because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
some of the signatures in 17 of said election returns are falsified, because <u>they
do not look</u> <u>like</u> the corresponding signatures in the minutes of
voting; (b) one (1) return <u>does not bear the signature of</u> the poll
clerk; (c) another return <u>lacks the signature</u> of one (1) inspector; (d)
the 46 "Excess ballots" reported in still another return prove that
the same is false; (e) the fact that the total number of votes (114) obtained
by Moore and <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> exceeds by one the number of voters
(113) who had cast their votes and the number of ballots (113) recorded in a
fourth return, establishes that the same is spurious; (f) the entries and the
signatures in a fifth return had been <u>written by one and the same</u> hand;
and (g) the election returns for three other precincts had, likewise, been <u>prepared
by one and the same hand</u>.<u> </u>None of <st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>'s
aforementioned affidavits tends, however, to establish any of these pretenses,
which refer to <u>physical facts</u> and conclusions drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, such facts were
determined by the COMELEC upon physical examination of the questioned returns
and other pertinent documents, and We are not prepared to declare that said
determination is not substantially supported by the record.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to petitioner's allegation, the <span class="SpellE">photostatic</span> copy (Annex 16-B) of the election returns for
Precinct 2 of <span class="SpellE">Catubig</span>, bears the signatures of all of
the members of its board of election in­spectors.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well settled that the question whether
certain returns are falsified or have been tampered with and should not be
included in the canvass, must first be raised before the board of canvassers,
subject to appeal from its decision to the COMELEC.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>
did not do so, and, instead, took it up directly with the COMELEC, in violation
of the explicit provision of Section 163, R.A. No. 180, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this he did on <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1969</st1:date>, by filing his peti­tion Annex
P <u>after</u> the completion of the canvass by the Board, when it was already
known that <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> had obtained a plurality of 459
votes. It should be noted, in this connection, that, although in his
"Urgent Omnibus Motion" (Annex K) of <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1969</st1:date>, he had alleged that "more than
one hundred (100) election returns x <span class="SpellE">x</span> were tampered
and falsified, " he did not mention then either the municipalities or the
precincts alluded to.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Non-compliance with said Section 163 cannot
be justified by Moore's allegation to the effect that Lt. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>, a brother of respondent Raul <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>,
had threatened to kill his (Moore's) watcher, Atty. Antonio Saba, and that, in
consequence thereof, the latter and other watchers of Moore were
"practically prevented through fear from attending the canvass" and
Moore "was not represented during the canvass of the election returns from
eleven (11) municipalities." To begin with, this allegation has not been
duly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the alleged
incident between <span class="SpellE">Daza's</span> brother and Atty. Saba is
said to have taken place on <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1969</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="16">4:45 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it was not mentioned in a communication
(Annex 2) filed with the Board by Moore's "spokesman", evidently
after 5:00 p.m. of that date, merely expressing non-conformity with the
decision of the Board to continue its canvass up to 7:00 p.m. daily, upon the
ground that the working hours, pursuant to the Revised Administrative Code and
the Civil Service Law, end at 5:00 p. m. and that the representatives of Moore
could not attend the canvass after that time, because some of them were
"going home" to their "respective towns which are distant from <span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>" - where the canvass was held - "to
attend to urgent official and personal business."</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the COMELEC supervisor, present at the canvass, denied
the aforementioned incident, which is further negated by the fact that the
detailed minutes of the canvass (Annex 1) are silent about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although reference was made to said alleged
incident in a letter of Moore's watchers (Annex 3), dated November 27, 1969,
and filed with the Board on November 28, 1969, it was forthwith denounced as
false by nine (9) watchers of <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>, in another
communication (Annex 5) to said Board, dated November 28, 1969, and by respondent
<span class="SpellE">Daza</span> himself in his letter (Annex 6) of the same
date, as well as by Lt. Antonio A. <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>, in his
affidavit (Annex 7) dated Decem­ber 10, 1969.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The election returns sought to be excluded by
<st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city> are those of some precincts
of the municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Catubig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>,
Las <span class="SpellE">Navas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mondragon</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Antonio</st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:city><st1:place>San Isidro</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The returns for <span class="SpellE">Catubig</span>
were canvassed in the presence of <st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>'s
watchers, before they absented themselves, on <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1969</st1:date>, after <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00
 p.m.</st1:time> The returns for <st1:city><st1:place>San Antonio</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place>San Isidro</st1:place></st1:city> were canvassed,
also, in their presence, on <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="11">November
 30, 1969</st1:date>. Moore assails eight (8) returns from <span class="SpellE">Catubig</span>,
four (4) from San Antonio and four (4) from San Isidro, so that, of the
twenty-five (25) returns he sought to exclude from the canvass, sixteen (16)
were in fact can­vassed in the presence of his watchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, they did not question any of said
sixteen (16) returns before the Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, on <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="11">November 30,
 1969</st1:date>, the Board met and completed its canvass in the PC barracks in
<span class="SpellE">Catarman</span>, <st1:place>Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
where <st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city> was ad­mittedly
represented by his watchers and it is not claimed that they had been under any
restraint or duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, they did not
point out to the Board the alleged tampering or falsity of any of the six­teen
(16) or twenty-five (25) election returns above-mentioned.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 46 "Excess ballots" reported in
the election return for precinct No. 19 of <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span> do
not necessarily justify the conclu­sion drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
by petitioner Moore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
explained by <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>, the total number of ballots
received for said precinct were 250, of which 154 were used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>
obtained 67 votes and <span class="SpellE">Daza</span> 84 votes, or a total of
151 votes for both, so that, apparently, 3 voters had not voted for
representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total number of
unused ballots reported in the return were 50, which, added to the 154 used,
aggregate 204, This leaves 46 ballots unaccounted for, thus indicating that the
46 so-called "Excess ballots" are, in fact, unused ballots.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the return for Precinct No.
32 of <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span> (Annex 51-C) which does not bear the
signature of its poll clerk, it is obvious that this fact does not suffice to
nullify said return. In­deed, the provision of Section 150 of R. A, No. 180, as
amended, requiring the signature on election returns of the members of the
board of election inspectors "present", necessarily indicates that
the absence of the signature of one of them does not necessarily invalidate the
return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the chairman of
said board, its inspector for the Liberal Party and the poll clerk have
executed affidavits (Annexes 51, 51-A and 51-B) stating that the latter's
failure to sign on said return had been due merely to inadvertence on their
part.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As regards the allegation that the entries as
well as all of the signatures on the election return for Precinct No. 11 of Las
<span class="SpellE">Navas</span> had been written by only one hand and that the
returns for Precincts Nos. 16, 17 and 18 of the same municipality had been similarly
written by one and the same hand, suffice it to say that, upon an examination
of said returns, We can not say that the COMELEC has erred, much less abused
its discretion, in finding for respondent <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">10.<span style=""> </span>Referring now to the return for Precinct No. 14
of San Antonio, it is obvious that the excess of one (1) vote, in the total
number of votes (114) obtained by Moore (42) and <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>
(72), over the number (113) of persons who voted, and whose ballots were found
in the box for the valid ballots, is most probably due to a clerical error, and
does not necessarily prove that the return is false or has been tampered with.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">11.<span style=""> </span>Significantly, the copies of the returns for
the Provincial Treasurer dovetail in every respect with those of the COMELEC
and those for the Municipal Treasurers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This circumstance strongly indicates that the copies on which the Board
had based its canvass are genuine.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">12.<span style=""> </span>It may not be amiss to add that the affidavits
submitted to Us by the petitioner, tending to show that the contested returns
had been made under duress, were contradicted by affidavits (Annexes 40 and
40-A to 62-A), filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Daza</span>, of members
of the corresponding boards of election inspectors, who declared that the
proceedings in the precincts adverted to above had been regular, peaceful and
orderly, that the questioned returns were freely prepared, that the entries
therein reflect the true result of the election in their respective precincts
and that the signatures on said returns are the genuine signatures of the
members of the afore­mentioned boards of election inspectors.</p>
