				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF CORRECTION OF ENTRIES IN THE BIRTH

				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Government from the order of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch XXII, granting the petition of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for the correction of certain entries in the
record of her birth in the Civil Registry of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was submitted for decision without <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief in reply to that of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a verified petition filed with the lower court on October 12,
1965 <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
alleged, among other things, that on June 17, 1946 the Medical Office of the
Bureau of Health (then in charge of the Maternity and Children's Hospital)
reported to the Civil Registry of Manila the fact of the petitioner's birth in
said hospital on June 11, 1946; that the corresponding entry in the said
registry shows "Adelaide <span class="SpellE">Kwong</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Kwong</span>" as her
name and the name of her father, respectively; that her real name is <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> and his
father's, <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>; that the said entries are clerical
errors and are not in accordance with the information given by her mother; and
that since birth she has been using the name <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner prayed that the erroneous entries be corrected
accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1966</st1:date> the Solicitor General filed an
opposition on the ground that the petition states no cause of action for the
reason that the errors sought to be corrected are substantial in nature, since
they involve a change of names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1966</st1:date> the trial court granted
the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order appealed from must be reversed and the petition
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, as far as
the petitioner is concerned, the proper petition should be one for change of
name under Rule 103 and not for mere correction of a clerical error in the
registry under Article 412 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The error certainly is not clerical but substantial in nature, and is
not patent or visible on the face of the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The summary proceedings under <span class="GramE">Article 412 "only justify</span> an order to correct innocuous
or clerical errors that are visible to the eyes or obvious to the
understanding." (Black vs. Republic, L-10869, Nov. 28, 1958; <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> vs. Republic, L-10226, Feb. 14, 1958; Tan Su vs.
Republic, L-12140, April 29, 1959; <span class="SpellE">Bentoto</span> vs.
Republic, L-14978, May 23, 1961; De Castro vs. Republic, L-17431, April 30,
1963; <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> Lin vs. Republic, L-18213, Dec. 24, 1963.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting that the requirements of Rule 103 as to publication
and notice of hearing have been com­plied with and therefore the petition may
be treated as one for change of name, still the same is fatally defective in
that the name "<span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Kwong</span>"
sought to be corrected does not appear in the caption of the petition nor in
the notice of hearing which was published.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Ng <span class="SpellE">Yao</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> vs.
Republic, L-20306, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1966</st1:date>,
reiterated in Chan Chin vs. Local Civil Registrar of Manila, L-27159, <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1969</st1:date>, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is our view that his failure in the heading of the
application to give the true name sought to be changed is fundamental; such
failure is non-compliance with the strict requirements of publication; it is
fatal; and the court did not acquire jurisdiction to hear the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Notices
in the newspapers, like the one under consideration, usually appear in the back
pages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reader, as is to be expected,
merely glances at the title of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is only after he has satisfied himself that the title interests him,
that he proceeds to read down further.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The probability is that the portions in the publication heretofore
quoted will escape the reader's notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="GramE">purpose</span> for which the publication is made,
that is, to inform, may thus be <span class="SpellE">unserved</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And as far as the petitioner's father is concerned, the order of
correction is unjustified since he does not appear as one of the petitioners,
nor is his name included in the publication of the notice of hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is reversed and the
petition is denied, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
