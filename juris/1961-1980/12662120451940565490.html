<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal taken to the 
Court of Appeals from a final order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> approving the report submitted by the Commissioner 
appointed for the relocation of parcels 2 and 4 described in paragraph 2 of the 
complaint, and parcels A and B described in paragraph 5 of the amended 
complaint. The Court of Appeals, however, certified it to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on the ground that the issues involved are purely of law. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The record discloses that 
appellants' contention is that they sold to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
only 16 hectares of their property at P100.00 per hectare. It is their 
contention in this appeal that the Commissioner who did the relocation should 
have determined and should have stated in his report the area of the land 
actually occupied by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, so that the 
execution of the revived judgment may be exactly in accordance with the sale 
made by appellants in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and, the 
Commissioner not having done so, the lower court should not have approved his 
report. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find appellants contention to 
be without merit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While it is true that their 
answer claimed that they sold only 16 hectares to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, the decision of the lower court is silent upon the 
matter. Moreover, said decision clearly states that in the joint petition 
submitted by the parties to said court, appellants had expressly recognized "the 
possession and ownership (of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) of the lands as 
alleged in the complaint and as expressly admitted to have been in her 
possession in paragraphs 8 and 10 of the answer filed by Atty. Isidro A. Vera" 
(see record on appeal, pp. 4 and 5). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As it is not denied that what 
<span class="GramE">was</span> relocated by the Commissioner were the lands 
actually in possession of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> at that time, we 
consider it unnecessary for his report to state the area thereof. The 
relocation, as made, is now undoubtedly sufficient to prevent any encroachment 
by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> upon the remaining lands of <span class="SpellE">appellants—as</span> we suppose was the purpose of the relocation. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the ordered appealed from is 
affirmed, with costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
