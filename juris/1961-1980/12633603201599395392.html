of First Instance of Rizal on April 4, 1957 in trusteeship proceeding
No. Q-73.
  <p>The trust was established pursuant to the will of the late Angela S. Tuason, particularly the clause which reads as follows:</p>

que fueren hijos de mi hija Angela otra porcion equivalente a dos
novenas partes del caudal bereditario. Dicbos tres legados sin embargo,
estan sujetos a la maoda que se menciona en el parrafo siguieate. Los

edad, y una mayoria de los mismos acordaren la termlnacion de la
administracion. For nietos, debe enterderse no solamente a los nietos
varones sino tambien a los nietos mujeres."</blockquote>

  <p>Appellee
J. Antonio Araneta was appointed trustee on March 24, 1950 and he
qualified on the following May 5 when he took his oath of office. The
beneficiaries of the trust are Benigno, Angela and Antonio, all
surnamed Perez y Tuason, the last two being represented by appellant
Antonio Perez, who is their father and judicial guardian.</p>
  <p> In
the order appealed from the lower court approved, upon petition of the
trustee, a deed of donation executed by him on April 30, 1955 in favor
of the City of Manila covering a lot pertaining to the trusteeship,
with an area of 853.1 square meters. Such approval was given over the
opposition of appellant Antonio Peres. As found by the lower court, the
said lot was being used as a street and had been so used since prior to
its acquisition by the late Angela S. Tuason. The street leads to other
lots also pertaining to the trusteeship with an area of 8,176.6 square
meters, and it is through the said street that the tenants occupying
those other lots pass in going to and from their respective houses. On
the lot in question the trustee had been paying a realty tax of P100.00
yearly.</p>
  <p> The lower court also found that the lots
aforementioned would be converted into a residential subdivision and
that for the purpose the corresponding plan has been prepared; that the
lot donated to the City of Manila appears on the plan to be included
among the areas covered by the street lay-outs as required by law; and
that the donation would save the trusteeship the amount of the realty
tax and relieve it from the duty of maintaining the lot in usable condition as a street. There can be no dispute therefore that the
donation was beneficial to the trusteeship, not to say necessary under
the law if the planned residential subdivision is to be realized.</p>
  <p>
Appellant does not deny the beneficial aspects of the donation. But he
maintains that it is invalid on the ground that under Article 736 of
the Civil Code "guardians and trustees cannot donate the properties
entrusted to them". It should be remembered that this article is a new
provision of the Civil Code, which took effect only on August 30, 1950
(Rep. Act No. 386) and does not apply retroactively to the testamentary
trust established upon the death of Angela S. Tuason on March 20, 1948,
taking into account Articles 2253 and 2255, which provide against such
retrospective operation on acts or events that took place under former
laws. There being nothing in the old Civil Code which prohibits a
trustee from donating properties under trusteeship, and considering
that the powers given to herein appellee as trustee are of a plenary
character, subject only to the limitation that they should be
permissible under the law; considering further that when the testatrix
conferred such powers she must have had in mind the law that was In
force at the time; and considering finally that after all a trust is
created for the benefit of the <em>cestuis que</em> trust and that in
this particular case the acts of the trustee are subject to the
supervision of the Court, We see no reason why the donation In question
should not be allowed.</p>
  <p>The new Civil Code, in prohibiting a
trustee from donating properties entrusted to him does so for the
protection of the trust beneficiaries and evidently contemplates gifts
of pure beneficence, that la, those which are supported by no other
cause than the liberality of the donor. But when the donation, as in
the present instance, is clearly in their interest, to say it cannot be
done would be contrary to the spirit and intent of the law.</p>
  <p> The order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant. </p>
  <p><i>Concepcion, C. J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Bengzon, </i><i> J.P., </i><i>Zaldivar</i> and <i>Sanchez, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
