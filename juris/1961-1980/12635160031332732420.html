				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1961</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Almirol</span> purchased
from <span class="SpellE">Arcenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalo</span> a parcel
of land situated in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>muni­cipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Esperanza</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Agusan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
and covered by original certificate of title P-1237 in the name of "<span class="SpellE">Arcenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalo</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Abalo</span>." Sometime
in May, 1962 <span class="SpellE">Almirol</span> went to the office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to register the deed of sale and to secure in his name a transfer certifi­cate
of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Registration was refused by
the Register of Deeds upon the following grounds, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, stated in his letter of <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1962</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Original Certificate of Title No. P-1237
is registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Arcenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aba­lo</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Abalo</span>, and by legal presumption, is considered conjugal
property;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in the sale of a conjugal pro­perty
acquired after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Civil Code
it is necessary that both spou­ses sign the document; but</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, as in this case, the wife has already
died when the sale was made, the sur­viving husband can not dispose of the
whole property without violating the existing law (LRC <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span>
No. 46 dated June 10, 1958).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To effect the registration of the afore­said deed of absolute
Sale, it is necessary that the property be first liquidated and transferred in
the name of the surviving spouses and the heirs of the deceased wife by means
of extrajudicial settlement or par­tition and that the consent of such other
heir or heirs must be procured by means of another document ratifying this sale
executed by their father."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of such refusal, <span class="SpellE">Almirol</span> went
to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> on a
petition for mandamus (sp. <span class="SpellE">civ</span>. case 151), to compel
the Register of Deeds to register the deed of sale and to issue to him the
corresponding trans­fer certificate of title, and to recover P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> in moral dam­ages and P1,000 attorney's fees and
expenses of litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span class="SpellE">Almirol's</span> assertion that it is but a ministerial duty of
the respondent to perform the acts required of him, and that he (<span class="SpellE">Almirol</span>) has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer with counterclaim for P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>
damages, the respondent reiterated the grounds stated in his letter of <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1962</st1:date>, averred that the
petitioner has "other legal, plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law by
appealing the decision of the respondent to the Honorable Commissioner of Land
Registration," and prayed for dismissal of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution of <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="10">October
 16, 1963</st1:date> the lower court, declaring that "mandamus does not
lie * * * because the ade­quate remedy is that provided by Section 4 of Rep.
Act 1151", dismissed the petition, with costs against the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present appeal by <span class="SpellE">Almirol</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question of law tendered for resolution is whether
mandamus will lie to compel the respondent to re­gister the deed of sale in
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the reasons relied upon by the respondent evince a
sincere desire on his part to maintain inviolate the law on succession and
transmission of rights over real properties, these do not constitute legal
grounds for his refusal to register the deed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether a document is valid or not, is not for the register of deeds to
determine; this function belongs properly to a court of competent jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Whether the document is invalid,
frivolous or intended to harass, is not the duty of a Re­gister of Deeds to
decide, but a court of com­petent jurisdiction." <span class="GramE">(Gabriel
vs. Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, et al, G.R. No.</span>
L-17956, <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9">Sept. 30, 1963</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"* * * the supposed invalidity of the con­tracts of lease is
no valid objection to their registration, because invalidity is no proof of
their non-existence or a valid excuse for denying their registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law on registration does not require that
only valid in­struments shall be registered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How can parties affected thereby be supposed to know their in­validity
before they become aware, actually or constructively, of their existence or of
their provisions?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the purpose of
registration is merely to give notice, then questions regard­ing the effect or
invalidity of instruments are expected to be decided <u>after</u>, <u>not</u> <u>before</u>,
registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must follow as a
necessary consequence that registration must first be allowed, and validity or
effect litigated af­terwards." (<span class="SpellE">Gurbax</span> Singh
Pablo &amp; Co. vs. Re­yes and <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, 92 Phil.
182-183)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, a register of deeds is entirely precluded by section 4 of
Republic Act 1151 from exercising his personal judgment and discretion when
confronted with the problem of whether to register a deed or instrument on the
ground that it is invalid. For under the said section, when he is in doubt as to
the proper step to be taken with respect to any deed or other instrument
presented to him for registration, all that he is supposed to do is to submit
and certify the question to the Commissioner of Land Registration who shall,
after notice and hearing, enter an order prescribing the step to be taken on
the doubtful question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4 of R.A.
1151 reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">"<u>Reference of doubtful matters to Commissioner of Land
Registration</u>. - When the Register of Deeds is in doubt with regard to the
proper step to be taken or memorandum to be made in pursuance of any deed,
mortgage, or other instrument presented to him for registration, or where any
party in inte­rest does not agree with the Register of Deeds with reference to
any such matter, the question shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Land
Registration either upon the certification of the Register of Deeds, stating
the question upon which he is in doubt, or upon the suggestion in writing by
the party in interest; and thereupon the Commissioner, after consideration of
the mat­ter shown by the records certified to him, and in case of registered
lands, after notice to the par­ties and hearing, shall enter an order prescrib­ing
the step to be taken or memorandum to be made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His decision in such cases shall be conclusive and binding upon all
Registers of Deeds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided, fur­ther</u>,
That when a party in interest disagrees we ruling or resolution of the
Commissioner and the issue involves a question of law, said decision may be
appealed to the Supreme Court within thirty days from and after receipt of the
notice thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing notwithstanding, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
correctly dismissed the petition for mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 4 above-quoted provides that "where any party in interest
does not agree with the Register of Deeds * * * * the question <u>shall</u> <u>be</u>
<u>submitted</u> to the Commissioner of Land Registration," who thereafter
shall "enter an order prescribing the step to be taken or memorandum to be
made", which shall be "conclusive and binding upon all Registers of
Deeds." This administrative remedy <u>must</u> be re­sorted to by the
petitioner before he can have recourse to the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Resolution of the lower court of October
16, 1963 is affirmed, at petitioner's cost.</p>
