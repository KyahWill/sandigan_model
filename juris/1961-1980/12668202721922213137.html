<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> found appellant <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Calacala</span> guilty of murder, 
qualified by treachery, aggravated by evident premeditation and mitigated by 
voluntary surrender. He was sentenced to <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> and its accessory penalties, and ordered to 
indemnify the heirs of his victim, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, in 
the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The killing is admitted. Domingo 
<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> died from massive internal hemorrhage and shock 
due to several stab wounds received in the chest, back and abdomen, and m the 
arms and right shoulder. The autopsy revealed that the heart, lungs and liver 
had been lacerated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The evidence has established the 
following facts beyond reasonable doubt: In the evening of December 22, 1959 a 
Christmas dance was held in barrio <span class="SpellE">Balincannaway</span>, 
Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>. Among those in attendance were 
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> and his "<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>," herein appellant, who was at the time the barrio 
lieutenant. A dance number was announced by Domingo to be one in which the 
"<span class="SpellE">tatang-agers</span>" were included. He took a partner for 
himself, but she asked to be excused before the music ended because "they did 
not dance well together." Feeling slighted, Domingo became angry. In a loud 
voice he complained that he should not have been thus embarrassed, being one of 
the barrio elders, and said that since the proper Christmas spirit was lacking 
"the dance should be discontinued." Appellant thereupon approached him, placed a 
hand in his shoulder and tried to placate him by minimizing the matter. Domingo 
continued to grumble for sometime, but finally appeared to calm down. The two of 
them then started to leave the dance hall. Before they could go out, however, 
Domingo rushed back, upset the gifts which were piled on a table and started to 
destroy the Christmas tree and the other festive decorations. Appellant again 
tried to pacify him, reminding him that his <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> 
was driving the guests away, but Domingo was not to be appeased. Appellant then 
went to the microphone and asked the guests to remain. Evidently determined to 
break up the celebration, Domingo grabbed the microphone from him and pushed him 
aside. Appellant fell and, recovering himself, <span class="GramE">drew</span> a 
pen knife and repeatedly stabbed the other man. Domingo turned to flee and was 
stabbed twice more in the back. He did succeed in running, but was later found 
lifeless some distance away from the dance hall. Appellant surrendered 
immediately to the authorities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The prosecution tried to prove 
treachery and premeditation thru the testimony of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, a first cousin of the victim and the only alleged 
eyewitness presented for that purpose. He said that Domingo was already 
peacefully going out of the dance hall with <span class="SpellE">Calacala</span> 
when the latter, without warning, started stabbing him. Domingo fell backwards 
as a result, protesting all the time that he was not going to fight, but 
appellant continued the assault. Domingo was able to rise and run but received 
two more blows from behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Full credence cannot be given to 
the testimony of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>. It is strange that of 
the many people present he alone a close relative of the deceased should be 
presented as eyewitness to the stabbing. Equally without explanation is why 
appellant should attack the victim after he had already calmed down and in fact 
was docile enough to allow <span class="GramE">himself</span> to be led outside 
the dance hall. And if the killing had been planned beforehand, as the 
prosecution maintains, it is difficult to account for the fact that appellant 
did not wait until he and the deceased were out aide, where there were no people 
present to witness the stabbing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The defense, on its part, claims 
that appellant used a knife because the deceased drew a gun on him after pushing 
him away from the microphone. But the evidence on this point is far from 
satisfactory. Immediately after the incident a policeman by the name of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Belo conducted a search of the scene and its 
vicinity with the aid of the electric lights and portable lamps. The 
investigation lasted almost an hour, and yet no gun was found. The gun which was 
presented as evidence at the trial was allegedly discovered by a certain <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Olivo</span> beneath the roots 
of a tamarind tree not far from the dance hall, a little before seven o'clock in 
the morning after the dance. The ownership of that gun, however, has not been 
definitely traced to the deceased. The only link the defense was able to show is 
thru the testimony of Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Estabillo</span>, who said that 
before the stabbing occurred Domingo <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> called him 
outside the dance hall to show him a pistol and to offer his aid if Aurelio 
should need anything, whatever that meant. Such link is much too tenuous, for 
<span class="SpellE">Estabillo</span> could not positively say that the gun 
presented in evidence was the same one that had been shown to him. As it was, 
according to the policeman to whom the gun was delivered and the police man who 
had custody thereof afterwards, the same was rusty and 
unserviceable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subjectively, the theory of self 
defense is on the face of it unbelievable. The gun, appellant said, was already 
drawn and aimed at him when he took out the knife from his pocket. Surely there 
must have been plenty of time for the deceased to fire before the first knife 
blow was struck. The defense claims that the heel of one of the two or three 
cartridges inside the chamber bore a dent as if it had been struck with the 
firing pin. Assuming it to be so, and the bullet was a dud, the deceased could 
have squeezed the trigger once or twice more. This he did not do, nor did he 
even use the gun as a bludgeon with which to hit at his opponent. For if he had 
done so appellant would have received at least a bruise. But none was shown by 
the evidence. Finally, if there was a gun and appellant had acted in self 
defense he would have no declared to the police authorities to whom he 
surrendered instead of refusing, as he did, to make any 
statement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our conclusion is that the act 
committed by appellant was neither premeditated nor treacherous, and therefore 
is not murder but simple homicide, with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary 
surrender. On the other hand, we do not consider the acts of the deceased 
immediately preceding the killing as sufficient provocation on his 
part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The judgment appealed from is 
modified by reducing the penalty imposed by the lower court to an indeterminate 
sentence ranging from eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u>, as minimum, to twelve (12) 
years and one (1) day of <u>reclusion temporal</u>, as maximum, and affirmed in 
all other respects, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
