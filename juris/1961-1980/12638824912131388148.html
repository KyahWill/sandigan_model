				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A perusal of the records of this case will readily show the
futility of the appeal from an order of the lower court denying a motion to set
aside a decree of registration and to reopen the land registration
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the trial
court in favor of the applicants ordered that Lot No. 1 be registered in the names
of Ramon M. Morco, married to Felicidad B. Morato and Rogelio M. Morco, married
to Pelagia Marquez, both of Camalig, Albay in equal shares, and Lot No. 2, in
the name of Ignacia Manila, married to Domingo Ortega, also of Camalig, Albay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It dismissed the opposition of the
oppositors, now appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
decision became final and executory, no appeal having been interposed therefrom
within the reglementary period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, the issuance of the decree of registration was ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Land Registration Commission then issued
Original Certificate of Title No. 0-312, covering Lot No. 1 in favor of Ramon
M. Morco and Rogelio M. Morco and Original Certificate No. 0-313, covering Lot
No. 2 to Ignacia Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meanwhile, the oppositors filed a petition to set aside the decision rendered
and the decree issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sought to
nullify such original certificates of title and to reopen the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The response of the trial court was in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It denied the petition on the
ground that there was no showing of fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is this order that is now assailed in this Court "as
contrary to law and the facts." As set forth at the outset, the effort to
do so is singularly lacking in merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court acted correctly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law is definitely on the side of the applicants, now
appellees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is provided in Section 38
of the Land Registration Act that a decree of registration may be reopened and
thereafter set aside on the ground of fraud.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In two decisions, Frias v. Esquivel<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and Baldoz v. Papa,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
there is a reiteration of the doctrine in accordance with the above provision
that the final decree of registration issued in accordance with law is
reviewable within one year and upon the ground of fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was emphasized by Justice Dizon, the <u>ponente</u>
in both cases, fraud is present when a party is deprived of his day in court,
thus preventing him from asserting his right to the property registered in the
name of applicants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a doctrine
that goes back to Grey Alba v. De la Cruz,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> a
1910 decision, which identified fraud with the "intention to deprive
another of [his] just rights"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
sufficing to constitute its "essential characteristic * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The Grey Alba decision was repeatedly cited with approval in subsequent cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The latest case in point reaffirming such a doctrine is Minlay v. Sandoval,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
decided in 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For
the law cannot look with approval on a claimant not being accorded the right to
be heard, unless, of course, such opportunity was lost through his own fault.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would not be in consonance with the
dictates of procedural due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">All that is necessary to show that there is no fraud is to state
the findings of fact of the lower court as set forth in the decision which had
become final and executory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:
"On the basis of the evidence presented, the Court finds the opposition of
the Abilas not well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that the late Carlos Abila executed an acknowledgment on <st1:date year="1929" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1929</st1:date> that the land he was occupying
located in the sitio of Bariw, barrio of Buga, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="GramE">Libon</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE">,</span> Albay belonged to the late Jacinto Manila who is the
father of the applicants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The oppositors
have not explained why their father Carlos Abila executed the acknowledgment if
in truth and in fact, he possessed the land in the concept of an owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Exhibit 4 that was executed by the late
Jacinta Siat, she said that the land she was occupying which has an area of 2
hectares more or <span class="GramE">less,</span> is located in sitio Balatigno,
barrio of Buga, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Libon</st1:placename></st1:place>,
Albay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This exhibit shows that the
predecessors-in-interest of the oppositors have occupied a land different from
the land sought to be registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the tax declaration of the parcels of land in the names of the heirs of
Benita Sayson and the heirs of Faustina Sayson show that the land of Benita Sayson
and Faustina Sayson who are the daughters of Jacinta Siat are located in sitio
Balatigno, barrio of Buga, municipality of Libon, Albay."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this portion: "It appearing that the possession of the
applicants of the land sought to be registered dated more than 30 years
preceding the filing of the application and that said possession has been
continuous, public and in the concept of an owner, the applicants are entitled
to have their title to the land confirmed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
b of Section 48 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, known as the Public Land Law as
amended by Republic Act No. 1942."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against

Act No. 496 (1902).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Section 38
reads thus: "If the court, after hearing finds that the applicant or
adverse claimant has title as stated in his application or adverse claim and
proper for registration, a decree of confirmation and registration shall be
entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every decree of registration
shall bind the land and quiet title thereto, subject only to the exceptions
stated in the following section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
shall be conclusive upon and against all persons, including the Insular
Government and all the branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the
application, notice, or citation, or included in the general description 'To
all whom it may concern.' Such decree shall not he opened by reason of the
absence, infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor by
any proceeding in any court for reversing judgments or decree; subject,
however, to the right of any person deprived of land or of any estate or
interest therein by decree of registration obtained by fraud to file in the
competent Court of First Instance a petition for review within one year after
entry of the decree provided no innocent purchaser for value has acquired an
interest."</p>
