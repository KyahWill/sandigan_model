				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, in its civil case
62710, granting the petition for naturalization of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> <u>alias</u> Charles <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner who was born in <st1:place><st1:city>Amoy</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1932" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1932</st1:date>, was admitted into
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1934" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1934</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is married to Anita <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>,
with whom he has six children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
exempt from filing a declaration of intention because he had been continuously
residing in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for more than thirty years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a
graduate of the <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> Institute of Technology with
the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. He has been
employed with the United Neon Light Company since 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic seeks the reversal of the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
on four grounds, namely: (1) that the petitioner's use of the <u>alias</u>
"Charles <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>" without judicial authority
disqualifies him from naturalization; (2) that the failure of the petitioner to
state in his petition his second <u>alias</u>, "Charles T. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>," is fatal to his appli­cation; (3) that the
petitioner does not have a lucrative income and (4) that the petitioner’s
character witness Alfonso Reyes is not in a position to vouch for the
qualifications of the petitioner for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the purpose of resolving this appeal, we need dwell only on
one of the grounds for reversal offered by the Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner has a wife and six
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his in­come tax
return for 1963, the following items constituted his in­come for that year:</p>

<blockquote>Salary as employee
of United Neon</blockquote>

<blockquote>Light
Co. ------------------------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P
4,800.00</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Total<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-----------------------</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P
8,772.00</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his income tax return for 1964, the following items appear:</p>

<blockquote>Salary from United
Neon Light Co. -------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">P<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4,800.00</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Commission and bonus
--------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>6,000.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>Tutoring (by the
wife) ------------------------ <u><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1,000.00</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Total
-------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P11<span class="GramE">,800.00</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His income tax return for 1965 shows the following:</p>

<blockquote>Salary from United
Neon Light Co. ---------<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P 5,543.32</blockquote>

<blockquote>Bonus from United
Neon Light Co. ---------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2,000.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>Commission - do -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>6,262.50</blockquote>

<blockquote>Tutoring
-------------------------------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>1,500.00</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Total
--------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P15<span class="GramE">,305.82</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Established is the rule that neither bonus nor commission is
taken into account in assessing the <span class="SpellE">lucrativeness</span> of
the income of an applicant for naturalization because these items are contingent,
unreliable, unstable, <span class="GramE">undependable</span> (<span class="SpellE">Nilda</span> <span class="SpellE">Tse</span> vs. Republic, L-19642,
Nov. 9, 1964; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> So vs. Republic, L-20145, June 30,
1965).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The item, "tutoring" by
the wife of petitioner, likewise cannot be considered in determining whether
the husband-applicant for naturalization has sufficient income in contemplation
of the Revised Naturalization Law (<span class="SpellE">Tanpa</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. Republic, L-20605, June 30, 1966).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, for the years 1963, 1964 and 1965,
only his salaries of P4,800, P4,800 and P5,543.32, respectively, may be taken
into account (after subtracting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the
corresponding taxes, if any)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has a wife and six growing children to maintain
and educate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, his income cannot
adequately provide for the decent needs of his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Uy</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> Ho vs. Republic</u>, L-19582, <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1965</st1:date>, this Court held that an income of
P7<span class="GramE">,799.30</span> a year is not lucrative where a petitioner
has a wife and five children to maintain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With more reason, therefore, do we hold that the income of the
petitioner in the present case is far from being <span class="GramE">lucrative.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is reversed,
and the present petition for naturalization is her dismissed, at petitioner's
cost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
