<p class="BODY">This is an action for partition mostly of real estate, ini­tiated
in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, the same rendered judgment for
the plaintiffs and against the defendants, who sought a review by the Court of
Appeals; but, on January 26, 1959, the latter dismissed the appeal on account
of defendants' failure to file their brief within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the defendants,
said appeal was, subsequently, reinstated, over plaintiffs' objection
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appropriate proceedings
thereafter, said appellate court rendered a decision reversing that of the
trial court and dismissing plaintiffs' complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition, for review on
certiorari, of plaintiffs herein, who maintain that the Court of Ap­peals erred
in reinstating defendants' appeal and, later, in rendering judgment for the
defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the defendants had been given by the Court of Appeals
the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of forty-five (45) days, from
notice, within which to file their brief, said period to expires January 24,
1959; that no such brief was filed on or before this date; that, nine (9) days
later, or on February 2, 1959, defendants mailed a motion, dated January 31,
1959, praying for the suspension of the running of said period, upon the ground
of illness of their counsel; that plaintiffs objected thereto and move, to
dismiss the appeal; that, on February 26, 1959, the appellant court denied said
motion for suspension and dismissed the ap­peal; that defendants moved for a
reconsideration of the order to this effect and submitted a medical certificate
attesting to the illness of their counsel; that plaintiffs objected to this
motion; and that, this notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals granted the same,
reinstated defendants' appeal, and extended the period for the filing of
defendants' brief, which, eventually, was filed seasonably.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs contend that the Court of Appeals had there by
committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of ju­risdiction,
inasmuch as defendants' motion for suspension of the period to file their brief
was filed after the period pre­scribed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> had
lapsed and the alleged illness of their counsel was not supported by a medical
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As re­gards the one
submitted by the defendants, almost two (2) months later, in support of their
motion for reinstatement of their appeal, plaintiffs allege that the
certificate at best shows that defendants' counsel, Atty. Crispin Fernandez,
had hypertension, which does not necessarily incapacitate him from preparing
his brief or, at least, filing a motion for extension or suspension of the
period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> before its expiration, and that said
illness must have been feigned, because the records of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> show that Atty. Fernandez had
appeared before the same, several times, from January 7 to January 29, 1959, in
connection with some cases specified in annexes A-1 to E-1 to plaintiff's
opposition to said motion of the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that, in passing upon the question
whether or not an appeal should be dismissed for fail­ure of the appellant to
file his brief or to explain the same, or whether an appeal shall be
reinstated, an appellate court may exercise, not only its judgment, but, also,
its discretion, hav­ing in mind the circumstances obtaining in each case,
includ­ing, if not particularly, the demands of substantial justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the aforementioned medical certificate<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
shows that Atty. Fernandez had had a "cerebral attack" in May, 1958;
that he had not fully recovered <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>; that his
power of speech had, also, been impaired; that "now and then" he had
"amnesia;" and that, as late as February 10, 1959, and subsequent days,
he had been under medical treatment, due to the recurrence of his illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering this background, and the view
taken by the appellate court on the merits of the case, we do not feel that a
grave abuse of dis­cretion had been committed in reinstating defendants'
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us now take up the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is an action for partition.
Plaintiffs are the descendants, and/or heirs of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alquiza</span>
by his first marriage.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Defendants are his descendants and/or heirs by a second marriage.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Plain­tiffs contended that some properties described in the complaint belonged
to the conjugal partnership of the first marriage and that the other properties
described in the same pleading belong­ed to the conjugal partnership of the
second marriage.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Upon
the other hand, defendants alleged that all of the properties in litigation
belong to them exclusively, some by purchase from Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alquiza</span>
or from other persons, and some by donation made by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alquiza</span>,
and that, moreover, they (defendants) had acquired title to said properties, as
sole and exclusive owners thereof, by prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the main issue was one of fact, on which both parties
introduced testimonial and documentary evidence. His Honor, the trial Judge did
not find the testimony of the witnesses for the de­fense worthy of belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he give full faith and credence
to the documentary evidence presented by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, "the lower court had in effect
annulled six (6) <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> documents," in the
language of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
detailed and careful­ly prepared decision, the latter, after analyzing that of
the Court of First Instance, as well as the evidence on record, and the ar­guments
pro and con, reached, however, the opposite conclusion Inasmuch, as the same depended
upon the credibility of the testi­mony of said witnesses and upon an appraisal
of the surrounding circumstances, as factors affecting the faith and credence
to be accorded to defendants documentary evidence, it is clear that, insofar as
the merits of the case, the decision thereon hinges on the determination of the
pertinent facts, the findings on which of the Court of Appeals are conclusive
upon us and beyond our power of review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals
must be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with costs against plaintiffs herein.</p>
