				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.,</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of Tax
Appeals (in CTA Case No. 1018), ordering the refund to Malayan Insurance
Company, Inc., of the sum of P958.00 which was allegedly paid erroneously, and
the dismissal of the counterclaim of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for
payment of the withholding tax <span class="GramE">for</span> P15,416.96.</p>

<p class="BODY">Malayan Insurance Company, Inc. (hereafter referred to as
MALAYAN), a domestic corporation which has reinsurance contract with Orion
Insurance Company, Ltd. of London (hereafter referred to as ORION) a
nonresident foreign corporation, without previous authorization, filed the
latter's income tax return for 1958 and paid the tax due thereon, in the sum of
P958.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding later that ORION had
commissioned another domestic entity, Filipinas <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Seguros</span> (to be referred hereafter as FILIPINAS) to
file the income tax return on its behalf, and that the said agent paid the sum
of P778.00 as corresponding income tax for the same year (1958), MALAYAN
requested the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the refund of the P958.00 it
had paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When no action was taken
thereon, MALAYAN filed a petition in the Court of Tax Appeals for the same
purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his amended answer to the petition, the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that in 1958, petitioner had ceded to ORION reinsurance premiums covering risks
located in the Philippines amounting to P64,327.36; that this amount is subject
to withholding tax in the sum of P15,416.96; that demand for payment of the
withholding tax was made upon petitioner on February 16, 1962; and that even if
petitioner is to be credited with the sum of P958.00, there would still be due
from the latter the sum of P14,458.96.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent, therefore, asked the Court that the petition be dismissed
and petitioner be ordered to pay P14<span class="GramE">,458.96</span>, with the
penalties incident to late payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties submitted the case for decision on the
pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1963</st1:date>, the Tax Court decided for therein
petitioner and ordered the refund of the sum of P958.00 it had erroneously paid
as income tax of ORION for 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for
the reason that FILIPINAS is the duly authorized representative of ORION,
respondent's counter?claim for P15<span class="GramE">,416.96</span> was
dismissed without prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commissioner of Internal Revenue interposed this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present proceeding, petitioner Commissioner of Internal
Revenue reiterates the allegation that in 1958, MALAYAN had ceded to ORION
reinsurance premiums<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
amounting to P 64,327.36, on which amount MALAYAN should have paid withholding
tax of P15<span class="GramE">,416.96</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner does not dispute that FILIPINAS was commis­sioned by ORION to
file its income tax return for 1958, in a commu­nication that reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Dear Sirs,</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Income Tax</blockquote>

<blockquote>Return of Annual Net
Income</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With reference to your letter dated <st1:date year="1958" day="26" month="12">26th December 1958</st1:date>, addressed to <span class="SpellE">Alexr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; Co., Ltd., we
would like to accept your offer to act on our behalf and appoint you our Agents
for the purposes of filing the Return of Annual Net Income as required by
Section 46 of Commonwealth Act 496.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is understood and agreed that neither the Appoint­ment nor
the filing of the Return is to be taken as an indication of the Company's
acceptance of liability to pay Income Tax, and the Company retains the right to
appeal for a refund of Tax whether this be Income Tax or withholding
Tax"., (p. 26, B.I.R. Record) </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> that said
agent, accordingly, had paid the sum of P778.00 as tax supposedly on the entire
taxable income of ORION for 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY">In assailing the correctness of the ruling of the Court of Tax
Appeals, however, the petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue contends that
the payment by FILIPINAS of the supposed tax on the incomes derived by ORION
from Philippine sources did not relieve MALAYAN of its obligation to withhold
and pay the withholding tax on the reinsurance premiums it had ceded to
ORION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 53(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>
provision is not only broad and all-embracing -- covering the receipt, control,
custody, etc. by any person, natural or juridical, for a foreign corporation

long as they are fixed or determinable and are received with regularity;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
but also, the Obligation imposed <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> upon the
withholding agent is compulsory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
evident from paragraph (c) of the same Section 53 of the Tax Code, which makes
the withholding agent <u>personally</u> liable for payment of the tax treated
there­in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this has to be so, for it
must be realized that the withhold­ing provision of Section 53 (b) is a device
without which the Phil­ippine Government may not be able to collect the proper
and correct tax on incomes, derived from sources in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
by aliens who are outside of the taxing jurisdiction of this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that the withholding
provision is not being applied if the income is to be remitted to Filipino
citizens, or resident aliens, or to nonresident aliens but conducting business <u>and</u>
maintaining office or place of business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In this connection, this Court has already held<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that reinsurance premiums ceded by domestic entities to nonresident foreign
corporations are determinable, periodical income of those foreign corporations
from sources within the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, therefore, are subject to withholding tax.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Tax Appeals, nevertheless, dismissed the
Government's claim for withholding tax against the withholding agent, on the
ground that the authorized representative of the taxpayer is FILIPINAS - an
indirect way of saying that the demand, if at all, should be made on the
latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause
of action of the Commissioner against MALAYAN is not for collection of income
tax, but for the enforcement of the withholding provision of Section 53 of the Tax
Code - the compliance with which obligation is imposed on the withholding
agent, <u>not</u> upon the taxpayer.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Whether or not the taxpayer, ORION, has a duly authorized representative in
this country is, consequently, beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that any of the
reinsurance premiums ceded by MALAYAN to ORION ever passed to the hands of
FILIPINAS, the representative of ORION.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence here that MALAYAN withheld a certain percentage
of the reinsurance premiums transmitted to ORION and that it (MALAYAN) had
filed a return thereon, as required by Section 53 (c) of the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is actually material is whether that
obligation of the withholding agent is affected by the payment by FILIPINAS of
the income tax of ORION for 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have to rule that the payment by FILIPINAS of the alleged tax
on the incomes of ORION did not relieve the withholding agent of its legal
duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the filing of the tax
return and payment of the amount of P778.00 as income tax cannot be considered
in this case as final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is there
no proof that the return made by FILIPINAS for ORION included the reinsurance
premiums ceded by MALAYAN, but the great difference between the amount paid and
that which should have been withheld and transmitted to the Philippine
Government, to take care of the taxes that may be due on that income (P15<span class="GramE">,416.96</span>), is sufficient to put one in expectancy of further
proceedings on that return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, an
investigation of the tax return filed by FILIPINAS was already conducted, and
in April, 1962, the examiners recommended the assessment against the taxpayer
of deficiency income tax in the sum of P6,442.00 (p. 67, B.I.R. Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, this is as appropriate an instance as any
for the operation of the provision of Section 53 (b).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, in the event the taxpayer is finally
found liable for deficiency tax on its incomes from the Philippines in 1958,
the Government would have no way of collecting what is still due from said
taxpayer, which is a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business and
without office or place of business in the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FILIPINAS cannot be considered the authorized
agent through which any deficiency tax against ORION may be collectible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As specified from the letter of appointment
of FILIPINAS, herein before quoted, the filing of the tax return by the agent,
which was therein authorized, would not even bind the principal to pay the tax
based thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to appeal or
claim for refund is also withheld from the agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, the importance of the
withholding under Section 53 is clearly underscored.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the foregoing considerations</b>, the decision appealed
from is modified; the ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals is reversed, insofar
as it dismissed the counterclaim of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the collection of the withholding tax (and
penalties incident to late payment) upon the reinsurance premiums ceded by res­pondent
MALAYAN to ORION in 1958, said respondent should be credited with the sum of
P958.00 it had erroneously paid as income tax of that foreign corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
