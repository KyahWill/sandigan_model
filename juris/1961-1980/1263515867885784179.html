of Industrial Relations, hereinafter referred to as CIR.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the behest of respondents Guillermo Sta. Ana and the Luzon
Brokerage Supervisors’ Union, on July <span style="">3,
</span>1961, a com­plaint for unfair labor practice was filed with the CIR
against herein petitioners, <span style="">Luzon </span>Brokerage
Co., Inc. - here­inafter referred to as the Company - its President, John I. <span class="SpellE">Nevans</span>, and its Office Manager, Victor M. <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>, for having suspended and, soon later, dismissed Sta.
Ana owing, accord­ing to respondents, to Sta. Ana's union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners herein denied the charge and
alleged that Sta. Ana had, together with three (3) other employees of the
Company, been suspended because they were implicated in the losses sustained by
the Company owing to pilferage and that Sta. Ana was later dismissed, after
thorough investigation establishing his complicity in the theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appropriate proceedings, a Judge of the
CIR<span style=""> </span>rendered
a decision <span style="">finding </span><span style="">the petitioners guilty as charged and
sentencing them to reinstate him to his former or equivalent position, with
back pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners filed a
motion for reconsideration, and soon thereafter</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">a supplemental motion
for new trial, on the ground of newly </span><span style="">discovered evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Upon
denial of these motions by the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, the present petition
for review on <i>certiorari</i> was filed by petitioners herein, upon the
ground t</span><span style="">h</span><span style="">at the CIR had erred and/or acted with </span><span style="">grave abuse </span><span style="">of discretion;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) in denying their <span style="">aforesaid </span>motion for re­consideration and supplemental motion <span style="">for </span>new trial; 2) in finding that they
</span><span style="">had
committed an </span><span style="">unfair labor </span><span style="">practice </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">suspending and
dismissing Sta. Ana; and </span><span style="">3) </span><span style="">in finding peti</span><span style="">tioners <span class="SpellE">Nevans</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>
</span><span style="">liable
</span><span style="">for the payment of Sta. Ana’s
back wages, despite the fact that they had merely acted as agents of the
Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main facts are not
disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth <span style="">in </span>the decision appealed from:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the manila Port Area, on a truck of the Company, driven by Roberto <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One (1) of
the cases </span><span style="">was, by order of Sta.

</span><span style="">truck
proceeded to and did </span><span style="">deliver the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Soon thereafter, the
Manila Port </span><span style="">Service reported </span><span style="">to the
Manila Police Department the alleged theft of one (1) case, containing 5006
Atkins Saw Teeth </span><span style="">valued P2<span class="GramE">,887.28</span>, </span><span style="">which turned out to be one of those consigned to <span class="SpellE">Shurdut</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection therewith, Sta.

helper and "extra" checker of the Company, respectively, <span style="">were investigated </span>by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 24, 1960, Sta. Ana <span style="">received </span>a letter of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nevans</span>, as President of the Company, advising him that,
"in view of the numerous ramifications of the <span class="SpellE">Shurdut</span>
Case, the Management regrets to inform you that they find it necessary to
suspend you indefinitely, effect­ive Thursday, August 25, 1960, as they feel
that your sus­pected implication in this case reflects badly on the per­formance
of your duties and can endanger the good reputation of the Company," and
that the same would conduct its "own administrative investigation, the
outcome of which will be the deciding factor on what further and permanent
action we would take." on September 23, 1960, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Management decided to <span style="">dismiss </span>him
for cause, namely, his <span style="">"implication
in pil­ferages on the <span class="SpellE">Shurdut</span> case and the U. S.
Veterans Adminis­</span>tration case," as well as his "other <span class="SpellE">negligences</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 21, 1961,
Sta. Ana brought the matter to the CIR, one of the prosecutors of which filed
therein, on July 3, 1961, a complaint charging petitioners herein with unfair
labor practice, upon the ground that they suspended him on August 24, 1960, on
account of his union activities, and on September 23, 1960, "to stop his
contact with the members of the Luzon Brokerage Association whose members are
employees" of the Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main proof in support
of this charge consisted of Sta. Ana’s testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of the decision ap­pealed
from:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Mr. Guillermo Sta. Ana testified, among others that those who
negotiated the collective bargaining agreement with the <span style="">company were the president, vice-president, secretary </span>and the audi­tor
of the <span class="SpellE">Lubrocoem</span> Association; that <span style="">he was re­quested </span>by his co-officers,
as auditor of the As­sociation, to attend the negotiation of the union with the
management, and he attended the negotia­tion two or three times; that he
proposed that the company provide legal assistance to them especial<span style="">ly when they commit honest mistakes; that he
sug­<span style="">gested that employees who commit
mistakes should not be immediately suspended or dismissed, but should be given
a chance to be heard through their union; that management answered that it was
immaterial to provide legal assistance for it might be­come </span>a habit on
the part of employees to make mistakes and then they would just depend on the
legal assistance by the company.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mr. Guillermo Sta. Ana also declared that in July, 1957, he
was verbally authorized by the pre­sident of the company, <span style="">Mr. </span>T.<span style=""> </span>K. Norton, to hire <span style="">ten
extra man for the job of checker; that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>
recommended </span>to <span style="">Mr. Ponce the
appointment of <span class="SpellE">Eraño</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>;
that those who were qualified were hired while those who were not qualified,
including <span class="SpellE">Eraño</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>,
were not hired; that <span class="SpellE">Eraño</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>
was disqualified upon recommendation of the regular checker through him; that
when Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> heard about </span>It, <span style="">he telephoned him and told him that if <span class="SpellE">Eraño</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span> would not be
hired, he was going to </span><span style="">use </span><span style="">his influence to </span><span style="">dismiss all </span><span style="">the ten checkers that he had hired, and then Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>
told him that he would put him down; that after July, 1957, he and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> were not in good terms anymore because of <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno's</span> case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mr. Sta. Ana also stated that after the death of his <span style="">supervisor, Mr. Felipe <span class="SpellE">Badillo</span>,
he </span>was recommended by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Capili</span> to the
position of acting head checker at Pier 3; that after five months as head checker,
he was called up by te­lephone by the <span style="">operations
manager, Mr. </span><span class="SpellE">Capili</span>, concerning the pilferage
in the <span style="">pier; </span>that he was given
an indefinite suspension on August 24, 1960; that he was <span style="">given a </span>memorandum of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> to submit to a lie-detector test; that he was not
informed of the result of the lie-detector test to which he submitted himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question for our determination <span style="">is </span>whether the foregoing evidence substantially supports the
following conclu­sion, made in said decision:</p>

<blockquote>"The first paragraph of the foregoing facts tends to prove the
veracity of the testimony of Mr. Guillermo Sta. Ana concerning his union
activities, and the second paragraph tends to prove the truth of the statement
of Mr. Sta. Ana that his dismissal, on account of his union activities, had
something to do with his rejection of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">rec</span>ommendee</span> (<span class="SpellE">Eraño</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>) of Mr. Victor <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> to become one of the checkers of the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third paragraph shows the bias of Mr.
Victor <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> <span style="">in </span>not showing to Mr. Sta. Ana the result <span style="">of the lie-detector test to which the latter
had submitted <span class="GramE">himself</span> at the request of the former.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon the whole, it appears that the dis­missal of Mr.
Guillermo Sta. Ana from the <span style="">ser­vice </span>of
respondent company was due to <span style="">his union
activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In other words, the
allegations in the Complaint are supported with substantial <span style="">evidence….”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>note that Sta.
Ana did not testify that, either his suspension, or his dismissal, was prompted
by his union ac­tivities. Indeed, these activities began since November 1953,
when he joined the Luzon Brokerage Employees Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said activities must have been manifest
since, at least, 1955, when the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> appointed him as
its special observer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">is more, </span>in 1957, he became <span style="">a </span>member of
the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s Board of Directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, <span style="">it
is </span>not even suggested that pe­titioners had shown any animosity or bias
against him, on account of his union activities, during these four (4) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sta. A<span style="">na </span>claims that <span style="">in </span>1957, he had an
incident with the office manager, petitioner Victor <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>,
because he (Sta. Ana) did not appoint <span class="SpellE">Eraño</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, a <span class="SpellE">recommendee</span> of <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>, as checker, upon the ground of lack of the re­quisite
qualifications. Sta. Ana testified that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nalus</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">phoned him and said </span>that, if <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>
would not be hired, he (<span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>) would put him (Sta.
Ana) down, apart from using his (<span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>') influence to
dismiss the checkers appointed by Sta. Ana, and that, since 1957, he was
"not in good terms" with <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nalus</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This <span style="">alleged resentment
or ill-feeling </span>was generated, however, <u>not</u> by Sta. Ana's <u>union
activities</u>, but, by his failure to accommodate a <span class="SpellE"><span style="">recommendee</span></span><span style=""> </span>of <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is,
</span>moreover, nothing in the record to indicate that Sta. Ana's <span style="">action in connection </span>therewith had any
connection whatso­<span style="">ever </span>with <span style="">his </span>aforementioned activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it <span style="">suggest that either <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> or the other
petitioners herein had been thereby induced to take any adverse action against </span>Sta.
Ana.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, on September 19, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>
appointed Sta. Ana <span style="">"as </span>Acting
Head Checker for a trial period of six <span style="">months,
effective retroactively on September 1, 1959," with </span>a raise of P25
in his monthly salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> further advised Sta. <span class="GramE">Ana, that</span>
"if your services are found satisfactory x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the <span style="">management
may consider confirming your permanent appointment as Head Checker with an
upward revision in your salary."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> even added:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u>We
appreciate the satisfactory work you have been doing</u> and trust you <span style="">will continue to </span><span style="">serve </span><span style="">the <span style="">Company
faithfully." In fact, on March </span>4, <span style="">1960, <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span> </span>issued the <span style="">corresponding "Notification of personnel
action," </span>to the effect that <span style="">Sta.
Ana had been </span></span><u><span style="">permanently appointed</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">as Head Checker,
with <u>another increase</u> <span style="">in </span>pay,
</span><span style="">this time a substantial one,
from P165 to P215 a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These two (2) promotions in status and in pay, and the
circumstances surrounding the <span style="">same,
strongly tend to show </span>that the alleged incident between Sta. Ana and <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>, way back <span style="">in </span>1957, had not so hurt the latter, as to
have left a wound still unhealed three (3) years later, and impelled him -
taking advantage of the pilferage that took place on August 11, 1960 - to
suspend and then dismiss Sta. Ana in <span style="">August
and September, respectively, of the same year, on account of the union
activities in which he had been engaged for the </span>past <span style="">seven (7) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In <span style="">fact, there <span style="">is </span>neither
direct nor in</span>direct evidence that the ultimate cause of the disciplinary
action taken against Sta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana was his
union <span style="">activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the Company to inform Sta. Ana
of the result </span>of the lie-detector test, to which he had submitted, does
not and can not show the <span style="">alleged bias
of <span class="SpellE">Nalus</span>, there being no proof or claim that Sta. Ana
had so much as asked or inquired about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the conclu­</span>sion of the CIR on the cause of his
dismissal <span style="">is
</span>based, therefore, on pure and simple speculation, justified, nei­ther by
the events <span class="GramE">preceding</span> <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1960</st1:date>, nor by those that took place thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is not <span style="">disputed
</span>that <span style="">out of four (4) cases </span>of
goods picked up from the Manila Port area, on August <span style="">11, </span>1960, one (1) was unloaded by
order of Sta. Ana, in front of the offices of the Company, and the other three
(3) were delivered to the consignee thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Manila Port Detachment, the Manila Police Department and the Company
were under the impression that: the unloaded case had been stolen. Having taken
part in the process of taking said four (4) cases and delivering three (3) of
them to the consignee, Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aloot</span>, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> and res­pondent Sta. Ana, truck helper, extra
checker, <span style="">driver and </span>head
checker, respectively, of the Company, were investigated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span style="">first three </span>(3) <span style="">made written statements to the Manila Police
Department. <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span> declared that, on Aug­</span>ust
11, 1960, four (4) cases were loaded on a truck of the Company (at the Manila
Port Area); that one (1) of <span style="">said </span>cases
was unloaded <u>by Sta. Ana</u> in front of the offices of the Company (in said
area); that, after securing a gate pass for the three (3) remaining cases, the same
were deli­vered to <span class="SpellE">Shurdut</span>, in "<span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>"; and that, on August 12, 1960, <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> gave him P10.00 out of P20.00 allegedly given to him
(<span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>) by Sta. Ana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aloot</span></span><span style=""> stated that Sta. Ana had ordered the loading
of said four (4) </span><span style="">cases </span><span style="">and then bade him
to secure a gate pass for only three (3) cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>, in turn, <span style="">affirmed </span>that, after said four (4) cases had been loaded on his
truck, he drove the same to the place in front of the offices of the Company,
where Sta. Ana ordered him <span style="">to unload
one </span>(1) case; that, after obtaining a gate <span style="">pass </span>for three (3) cases, he, together with <span class="SpellE">Aloot</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, delivered the same to <span class="SpellE">Shurdut</span>; that the next day, <u><span style="">Sta. Ana </span>h<span style="">anded him P20</span></u><span style="">, half of </span>which he gave to <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>; and that he, later, learned that the case left <span style="">in </span>front of the Company premises had
been taken out (of the Manila Port Area) and that the money given to him was <u>his
share of the sale thereof</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, <u>Sta. Ana <span style="">refused to make any written statement</span></u><span style="">, despite the unfavorable implications of the statements made by <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aloot</span> and <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The CIR was seemingly
under the impression that peti­tioners had committed an unfair labor practice
because they did not prove satisfactorily </span>that the aforementioned <span style="">case </span>of
merchandise had been stolen by Sta. Ana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our point of inquiry, however, is not whether Sta. Ana <span style="">is </span>guilty of theft, but, petitioners’ <u>motive</u>
in suspending and then dismissing him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, since there is neither direct nor strong circumstantial evidence
thereon, the issue boils down to what <span style="">was </span><span style="">in
all </span>probability, the main cause for said suspension and dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances adverted to above, petitioners <span style="">had reasonable grounds to believe, if not to
entertain the </span>moral conviction, that Sta. Ana was the <span style="">person mainly res­</span>ponsible for the
disappearance of the case of goods consigned to <span class="SpellE">Shurdut</span>
and not <span style="">delivered </span>thereto, and
for which the Company <span style="">would </span>have
to indemnify <span class="SpellE">Shurdut</span> in the sum of P2,469.45, <span style="">or, </span>at least, that the nature of his
participation therein rendered him absolutely unworthy of the trust <span style="">and </span><span style="">confidence demanded by his position <span style="">as head checker, and </span>that,
accordingly, he should <span style="">be dismissed,
not only </span>to punish him and as a deterrent to <span style="">similar <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of </span>other employees,
but, also, to protect the reputation of the Company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span><span style="">a matter of fact, the investigator <span style="">of the Manila Police </span>Department
concluded that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Gleaned from the foregoing facts, it is obvious that
Guillermo Sta. Ana holds the key to the mysterious disappearance of the missing
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the others
shared him with the proceeds of the loot although <span style="">com­paratively in </span>a very small way, <span style="">yet </span>it is clear that they acted only upon his (Sta. Ana) direct­ion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it has been established that Sta. Ana
<span style="">was the one responsible</span><span style=""> for leaving behind the one (1) missing box
and as <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> said, he "just learned that the one
box which <span style="">was ordered </span>left, was
