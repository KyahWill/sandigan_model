				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal directly to Us, on questions of law, from the
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
declaring Jose <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span> elected for the position of
vice-mayor of the municipality of Padre Garcia, province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
in Election Case No. 1521, entitled Jose <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>,
Protestant, <u>versus</u> Ricardo Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the local elections in November, 1963, the Municipal Board
of Canvassers of Padre Garcia, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, certified
that Ricardo Mendoza, one of two leading candidates for vice-mayor in that
municipality, obtained 1,327 votes, while his rival, Jose <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>,
obtained 1,310 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
was proclaimed elected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span> filed a petition of
protest against the proclamation of <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, however, filed a motion to
dismiss on the grounds that the court lacks jurisdic­tion and that the
allegations in the petition are am­biguous, indefinite and unintelligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By order of <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1963</st1:date>, the court denied the motion to dismiss
but required the protestant to submit an amended petition specifying thereat
the precincts protested and to indicate and describe all frauds, mistakes,
errors and irregularities committed in each of the said pre­cincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance, the protestant filed an
amended petition indicating that the irregularities so alleged were perpetrated
in Precincts 1, 10, 13, 17, 19, 21 and 22 of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Padre Garcia</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span>
filed an answer and counter-protest covering Precincts 2, 4, 8, 11, 14, 16 and
18, in the same municipality and on the same grounds stated in the protest of
the protestant.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering and counting all the ballots con­tested or
uncontested by one or the other, the lower court rendered judgment declaring
the protestant, Jose <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>, duly elected
vice-mayor, with a plurality of only one vote over the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
Ricardo Mendoza, with the right of the former to assume office as soon as
judgment becomes final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> has appealed and the
errors assigned by him will be taken one by one in the follow­ing discussions.</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE ADDITIONAL TWO (2) VOTES FOR
PROTESTEE-APPELLANT IN PRECINCTS 8 AND 18 AS PER REPORT OF THE BOARD OF
REVISORS IN SAID PRECINCTS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant insinuates here that the court below did not take
into consideration the findings of the Board of <span class="SpellE">Revisors</span>
as to the abovementioned precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the report submitted by the said Board, we find the following remarks:</p>

<blockquote><u>Precinct 8</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"One
ballot from spoiled ballot box claimed by <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After counting the votes for <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
it was found out that there were 22, while in the return there were only 21,
but counting the vertical entry there were actually 22."</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Precinct 18</u>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"After counting the votes cast in favor of <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>,
there were 44 while in the return and in the Tally Sheet there were 43.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">One ballot for </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Mendoza</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> written
in the column for Provincial Board claimed by <span class="SpellE">Protestee</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the lower court states that in Precinct 8,
twenty-two ballots all in all are claimed by <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
but since one of these ballots was taken from the <u>spoiled</u> ballot box,
and for failure of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to present evidence
to support his claim to it, the actual number of ballots counted for <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> should only be twenty-one.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to Precinct 18, the decision states that out of the forty-four
ballots for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, the Board con­sidered only
forty-three because one was written in the column for the members of the
provincial board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
the said ballot was not included by the commissioner for appreciation by the
trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown above, the findings of the lower court on these two
precincts were properly and correctly based on the reports made by the Board of
<span class="SpellE">Revisors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
thus see no basis for the first assigned error.</p>

<blockquote>II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN REJECTING AS VALID
VOTES FOR PROTESTEE-APPELLANT BALLOT EXHIBITS P22-C, P22-H, P22-I, P22-J, P22-K
and P22-L ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE MARKED BALLOTS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court observed that on these ballots all from one
precinct, the name of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Laylo</span>, a regis­tered
candidate for councilor, is written as "C. <span class="SpellE">Layle</span>"
and that it is the last name written for councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the mind of the trial judge, the placing
of "C. <span class="SpellE">Layle</span>" for "<span class="SpellE">Laylo</span>"
as the last name was a product of an under­standing among the voters and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> whose name appears in all these ballots as the
common candidate for vice-mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing
the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Villavert</span> v. Lim, 62 Phil. 178, that
"ballots should be rejected where the manner in which the candidates' name
is written gives him intention to mark or identify the ballot," the lower
court considered these exhibits as marked ballots which should not be counted
in favor of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Scrutinizing the said exhibits, we have found that in <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. P22-C, P22-I and P22-L, the arrangement in the names
of not only all the councilors voted for, but also of the senators, are the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> P22-J, the names of senators are arranged as in
the three mentioned exhibits but those of the councilors are not so arranged
for there are only four councilors voted for, the last, coincidentally, of
which is <span class="SpellE">Layle</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> P22-H, the
arrangement in the names of the councilors is also iden­tical to that in said <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. P22-C, P22-I and P22-L, but there are no names for
senators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span> P22-K is an en­tirely
different ballot as far as the arrangement in the names of senators and
councilors is concerned, but the last name written is "C. <span class="SpellE">Laylo</span>." <span class="GramE">Except for one (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> P22-J), the candidate voted for mayor in all
these ballots is <span class="SpellE">Pesigan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A showing alone that several voters belonging to the same
precinct have written the names of particular candidates in an identical manner
cannot justify the inference that the voters had a plan to identify their
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determinative factor in the
nullification of ballots for being marked as following a design or pattern is
the existence of evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> tending to
show the intention or purpose in the use of the contested manner or means of
voting, which is to identify the bal­lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, an identification mark cannot be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>

No such reasons appear herein." (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the name "<span class="SpellE">Laylo</span>"
is incorrectly spelled in these ballots should not invalidate the ballots be­cause
Rule 2, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code, is explicit that names of
candidates incorrectly written if <u>idem <span class="SpellE">sonans</span></u>
with the names of candidates shall be con­sidered valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Gutierrez v. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, G. R. No.</span> L-14252, <st1:date year="1959" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1959</st1:date>) <span class="GramE">In</span>
the absence of evidence that the name of a candidate was incorrectly written
designedly to identify the voter, the vote cannot be held invalid for said
candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second assigned error is
based upon a valid ground and we are constrained to consider the six ballot
exhibits valid, which also means six votes in favor of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant.</p>

<blockquote>III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN REJECTING AS VALID
VOTES FOR PROTESTEE-APPELLANT EXHIBITS P21-E, P19-A, P19-B, P22-D, P11-A and
P18-A ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE MARKED BALLOTS</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibit P21-E</u> - Apparently, the appellant does not
question the admission of this particular ballot but is questioning <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. PI-E as discussed in his brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this exhibit, the name "<span class="SpellE">Goce</span>," a candidate for councilor, is written not only
on the first space but also on the se­venth and eighth for councilors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has ruled in a number of cases
(Gutierrez v. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, <u>supra</u>; Guti­errez v.
Reyes, <u>supra</u>; Delgado v. <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-14143, </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 27, 1959</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; <span class="SpellE">Salalima</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sabater</span>, G. R. No.</span>
L-14829, May 27, 1959) that the writing of a name more than twice on the ballot
is considered to be intentional and serves no other purpose than to identify
the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore agree with the
lower court that said Exhibit P1-E is marked and must be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibit 19-A</u> - On space 1 for councilors, the name "<span class="SpellE">Evora</span>" is written.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Underneath, on spaces 2 and 3, there appear two parallel vertical lines
resembling quotation marks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On line 4
for councilors again, the name "Silva" is written, and under it, on
space 5, two parallel lines likewise appear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lines 6, 7 and 8 are filled up with names of other candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court below held that the intention of
the voter in putting these marks was to emphasize that he was vot­ing for <span class="SpellE">Evora</span> and Silva more than once.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has pronounced in <u>Delgado v. <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span></u>,
<u>supra</u>, that the two short parallel lines on spaces where the voter did
not vote merely indicate the voter's desistance from voting and should not
invalidate the ballot, which ruling is well in accordance with Rule 17 of the
Rules for the appreciation of ballots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Section 149, Revised Election Code) Ballot Exhibit 19-A is valid.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibit 19-B</u> - This ballot was rejected on the ground that
the voter had no fixed mind as to whom of the two candidates, Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>, he should vote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the space for vice-mayor, this is what appears:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MEND K.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We think the lower court did not commit a mistake in concluding that
after the voter here had written the first four letters of the name Mendoza, he
changed his mind and decided to write <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span> and he
so started by writing letter K.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vote
as it stands cannot be cre­dited for either of the candidates.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibits 22-D and 11-A</u> - Again, the court below did not
commit any error in rejecting these ballots as marked, it appearing that on
each of them are written three times the names of certain candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is on the same principle that Exhibit
P1-E is being excluded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Exhibit 18-A</u> - The name "<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>"
appears on the first and last spaces for councilors and on each of the spaces
in-between are two curved lines resembling close parentheses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases where we decided to declare as
invalid some ballots in which names of candidates are repeated, such names were
written three or more times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
case, the name "<span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>" appears only
twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of evidence to
show that the purpose was to identify the ballot, such a single repetition does
not invalidate the whole ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
are the lines on each of the empty spaces to be considered as marks since the
rule under paragraph 17 of the rules for the appreciation of ballots is that
circles, crosses or lines put on the spaces on which the voter has not voted
shall be considered as signs to indicate his desistance from voting and shall
not invalidate the vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 18-A is
then valid and the vote therein favor of the <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span>-appellant
should be counted.</p>

MARKED BALLOTS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Here, names of non-candidates appear on the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In each of Exhibits P18-9, 18-10, 18-11 and
18-13, the name "<span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>" has been written
on one of the spaces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in
Exhibits P18-12 and 18-13, the names "<span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Malaluan</span>" and "Domingo <span class="SpellE">Zono</span>"
respectively, appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the
hearing, these ballots were formally presented as evid­ence by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, claiming that if the name of a person who is not
a candidate has been written on any of the spaces this would not invalidate the
ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counsel for the protestant
made no comment to such pre­sentation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court, however, declined to make any discussion, and did not make
any ruling, on these ex­hibits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 13 under Section 149, is clear that "any vote in favor
of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy or in favor of a
candidate for any office for which he did not present himself, shall be void
and counted as a stray vote but shall not invalidate the whole ballot."
This rule has been applied by this court in a line of cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Gutierrez v. Reyes, <u>supra</u>;
Delgado v. <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
