General Manager from <span class="SpellE">Josefita</span> <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>-Villegas,
RCA <span class="SpellE">Incharge</span> at <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, ran in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"I have the honor to make the following reports:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. Sometime about the middle of Februa­ry, we received a
notice of shipment of rice from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
via MRR. Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, the warehouseman, authorized Mr. <span class="SpellE">Crispiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Sales
Supervisor to take delivery from <span class="SpellE">Sipocot</span> MRR Station
and to convoy the truck loaded with rice to <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed that one truck did not carry a
whole load so I inquired from one of the laborers why the <span class="GramE">load
seem</span> to be lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me
that by order of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, 20 bags were unloaded at
the house of the trucking contractor by the name of Mr. Sancho <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Asis</span></span><span style="">. </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> admitted unloading 20 bags at Mr. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Asis</span></span><span style="">' </span>house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to verify I personally went to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> and inquired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted that 20 bags were unloaded <span style="">in his </span>house, and added further that
this was the <span style="">quantity
</span>he requested to buy for his laborers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told him that the transaction was irregular, as we are not allowed to
sell by the sack much less 20 <span style="">sacks </span>to anybody.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"By the above incident, there are violations made on our
existing regulation like unautho­rized issue of rice without the necessary <span style="">pa­</span><span style="">pers like Official Receipt and Invoice, issue
</span>of rice to unauthorized person (not <span style="">a </span>retailer)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The RCA General Manager filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="3">March 29, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>an <u><span style="">administrative charge</span></u><span style="">
</span>against <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>
(Adm. Case No. 29-S-63), stating:</p>

<blockquote>"As employee of the <span style="">RCA in <span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camari­<span style="">nes</span></span></span> Norte, you are hereby charged of miscon­duct
in office and <span style="">violation
</span>of office rules and regulations in that on the middle part of February,
1963, <span style="">you
ordered 20 bags of RCA rice </span><span class="GramE">be</span> unloaded in the
house of certain <span class="SpellE">San­cho</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Asis</span></span><span style=""> </span>without
supporting papers in form of <span style="">official receipts and invoices."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither the report nor the charge <span style="">was </span>under oath.</p>

<p class="BODY">RCA investigator Francisco G. Cordoba, Jr. <span style="">was </span>sub­sequently
assigned to conduct the administrative investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Submitting to him a motion to <span style="">dismiss, </span><span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> ar­gued that pursuant to Section 32 of Republic Act
2260 the administrative investigation cannot proceed without a sworn
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Said motion was denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pressing the same argument, <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> filed
<span style="">in </span>the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte a petition
for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition with <span style="">preliminary
injunction against </span>the RCA investigator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And after <span style="">submission of the case </span>upon the pleadings, <span style="">said </span>court rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="7">July <span style="">6, </span>1964</st1:date>
restraining the respondent from proceeding with the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent has appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span>
to raise questions of <span style="">law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal <span style="">issue is </span>whether petitioner's investi­gation is legal
notwithstanding that no sworn complaint was filed against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of Section 32, Republic Act 2260 - the Civil
Service Act - <span style="">relied
</span>upon by petitioner, states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 32.</span> <span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Disciplinary action</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> - </span>No officer or <span style="">employee in the civil service shall be </span>removed
or suspended except for cause as provi­ded by <span style="">law </span>and after due process: x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>Provi­ded</u>, <u><span style="">further</span></u><span style="">, </span>That no <span style="">complaint against a civil </span>service official or employee shall be
given due course unless the same <span style="">is in </span>writing and subs­cribed and sworn to by
the complainant: x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And implementing said provision is
Section 24 of Rule XVIII of the <span style="">Civil Service, also invoked by petitioner, </span>as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 24.</span> Except <span style="">as </span>otherwise
provided by law, administrative proceedings may be com­menced against a
subordinate officer or emplo­<span style="">yee </span>by the head of Department or agency con­cerned or upon
complaint of any other person; Provided, That no complaint against a civil
service official or employee shall be given due course unless the same is in
writing and subscribed and sworn to by the complainant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can readily be seen from the foregoing that an administrative
proceeding may be commenced in one of two ways: (1) upon a charge by the
Department or Agency head; or (2) upon a complaint filed by <span style="">any </span>other person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­fore, the aforementioned provision that
no complaint shall be given due course unless under oath, pertains to admi­nistrative
proceedings commenced by complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does
not apply to proceedings commenced by direct charge of the Department or Agency
head, for in such event no complaint is required (Bautista v. <span class="SpellE">Negado</span>, <span style="">L-14319, <span style="">May </span></span>26, 1960).</p>

<p class="BODY">The RCA General Manager is the Agency head of said office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to take <span style="">disciplinary </span>action against RCA
employees lies in him (Sec. 4, RA <span style="">3452).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>From time to time he may receive
reports from his subordinate offi­cers on alleged <span style="">irregularities </span>by RCA employees, as
part of the information regularly transmitted to him by said officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should he decide, upon the basis of such re­ports
or otherwise, to file administrative charges himself, the law does not require
of him what it requires of other persons who wish to institute administrative
pro­ceedings against the employees of his office: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>a sworn complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reasons for the difference are not hard to see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position of <span style="">responsibility </span>which he occupies sufficiently
warrants that his charges are worth investigating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he acts in the performance of a function
he has al­ready sworn, upon assuming office, to faithfully discharge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regardless, therefore, of whether the report of <span class="SpellE">Jose­fita</span> <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>-Villegas is a complaint
or not, the administrative proceedings not having been commenced thereby, its
not being under oath is beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said proceed­ings <u><span style="">being upon
the instance of the RCA General Manager </span>himself</u>, a sworn complaint
is not required under the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span>
the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and set aside and the petition
filed below is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Castro, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span></span><br>
