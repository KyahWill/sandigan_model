<p class="BODY">The factual setting necessary to a clear understanding of the
instant petition for certiorari needs to be restated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Albert sued University Publishing
Company, Inc. for breach of contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Albert died before the case proceeded to trial, and <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>
R. Albert; his estate's administrator, was substituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, defendant's liability was determined
by this Court in L-15275.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff was
to recover P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> with legal interest from
judicial demand.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the inception of the suit below up to the time the Judg­ment
in L-15275 was to be executed, the corporate existence of University Publishing
Company, Inc. appears to have been taken for granted, and was not then put in
issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when the Court of First
Instance of manila issued on <st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="7">July 22,
 1961</st1:date> an order of execution against University Publishing Company,
Inc., a new problem cropped up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue of this writ, plaintiff's counsel and the Sheriff of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
went to see Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> who signed the contract
with plaintiff on behalf and as President of University Publishing Company,
Inc. They then discovered that no such entity exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A verification made at the Securities and
Exchange Commission confirmed this fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1961</st1:date>,
said Commission issued a certification "that the records of this Com­mission
do not show the registration of UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING CO., INC., either as a
corporation or partnership."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
This triggered a verified petition in the court below on <st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1961</st1:date> for the issuance of a writ of
execution ordering the Sheriff of Manila to cause the satisfaction of the
judgment against the assets and properties of Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
as the real defendant in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">All along, Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> and his law
firm were counsel for the University Publishing Company, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of informing the lower court that it had in its possession
copies of its certificate of registration, its articles of incorpora­tion, its
by-laws and all other papers material to its disputed corporate existence,
University Publishing Company, Inc. chose to remain silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1961</st1:date>, University Publishing Company, Inc., by counsel <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mamaril</span> and Associates
(the law firm of Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> aforesaid) merely
countered plaintiff's petition for execution as against <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
with an <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> manifestation in court that
"said Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> is not a party to this

<blockquote>"The fact of <u>non</u>-<u>registration</u> of University

disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant would only raise the
point that 'University Publishing Co., Inc.' and not Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, is the party defendant; thereby assuming that
University Publishing Co., Inc. is an existing corporation with an independent
juridical personality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely,
however, on account of the non-registration it cannot be considered a
corporation, not even a corporation <u>de</u> <span class="GramE"><u>facto</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>Hall vs. <span class="SpellE">Piccio</span>,
86 Phil. 603).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has therefore no
personality separate from Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>; it cannot
be sued independently.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The corporation-by-<span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
doctrine has not been invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, the same is inapplicable here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> represented a non-existent entity and induced not
only the plaintiff but even the court to be­lieve in such representation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He signed the contract as 'President' of
'University Publishing Co., Inc. stating that this was 'a corporation duly
organized and existing under the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and obviously misled plaintiff (Mariano A. Albert) into believing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One who has induced another to act upon his
willful misrepresentation that a corporation was duly organized and existing
under the law, cannot thereafter set up against his victim the principle of
corporation by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> (<span class="SpellE">Salvatiera</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Garlitos</span>, 5 6 0. G. 3609)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'University Publishing Co., Inc. purported to come to court,
answering the complaint and litigating upon the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as stated, 'University Publishing Co.,
Inc. has no independent personality; it is Just a name Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> was, in reality, the one who answered and litigated,
through his own law firm as counsel. He was in fact, if not in name, the defen­dant.</blockquote>

p. 3073, we ruled:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of a corporation which has no valid existence
assumes such privileges and obligations and becomes personally liable for
contracts entered into or for other acts performed as such agent.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
been named as party defendant instead of, or together, with, 'University
Publishing Co., Inc.' there would be no room for debate as to his personal
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since he was not so named,
the matters of 'day in court' and 'due process' have arisen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this connection, it must be realized that parties to a
suit are persons who have a right to control the proceedings, to make defense,
to adduce and cross-examine witnesses, and to appeal from a decision' (67
C.J.S. 887) - and <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> was, in reality, the person
who had and exercised these rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, then, <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> had his day in court as
the real defendant; and due process of law has been substantially observed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By due process of law we mean 'a law which hears before it
condemns; which proceeds upon in­quiry, and renders Judgment only after
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'
(4 Wheaton, U.S. 518, 581); or, as this Court has said, 'Due process of law'
contemplates notice and opportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered,
affecting one's person or property.’ <span class="GramE">Lopez vs. Director of

may not be amiss to mention here also that the 'due process' clause of the
Constitution is designed to secure Justice as a living reality; not to
sacrifice it by paying undue homage to formality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <u>substance</u> must prevail over <u>form</u>,
It may now be trite, but none the less apt, to quote what long ago we said in
Alonso vs. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, 16 Phil. 315, 321-322:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'<span class="GramE">A litigation</span> is not a game of
technicalities in which one, more deeply schooled and skilled in the subtle art
of movement and position, entraps and destroys the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, rather, a contest in which each
contending party fully and fairly lays before the court the facts in issue and
then, brushing aside as wholly trivial and indecisive all imperfections of form
and technicalities of procedure, asks that Justice be done upon the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lawsuits, unlike duels, are not
to be won by a rapier's thrust.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to Justice and
becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration from
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be no vested rights
in technicalities.'</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence is patently clear that Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, acting as representative of a non-existent
principal, was the real party to the contract sued upon; that he was the one
who reaped the benefits resulting from it, so much so that partial payments of
the consideration were made by him; that he violated its terms, thereby precipitating
the suit in question; and that in the litigation he was the real
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perforce, in line with the
ends of Justice, responsibility under the judgment falls on him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We need hardily state that should there be persons who under
the law are liable to <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> for reimbursement or
contribution with respect to the payment he makes under the judgment in
question, he may, of course, proceed against them through proper remedial
measures.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the order appealed from is hereby set
aside and the case remanded ordering the lower court to hold supplementary
proceedings for the purpose of carrying the judgment into effect against
University Publishing Co., Inc. and/or Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be observed that even as this case was elevated to this
Court in L-19118, University Publishing Company, Inc. or its president and
counsel chose to withhold pertinent documents and papers in its possession and
control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when the foregoing judg­ment
came, the University Publishing Company, Inc., in its motion for
reconsideration thereof, asked that it be afforded opportunity to prove its
corporate existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It submitted with
that motion for reconsideration, its certificate of registration, articles of
incorporation, by-laws, and a certificate of reconstitution of records issued
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was procured only from the
Securities and Exchange Commissioner on <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="4">April
 1, 1965</st1:date> - after the decision in L-19118 was promulgated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, the president and
counsel of University Publishing Company, Inc., for the first time appeared <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>propria</u></span><i> </i><u>persona</u> before this
Court as a "member of the Philippine Bar, private citizen." He
pointedly stated that he did not submit to the jurisdiction of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted, though, that his side of the case
be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He formally joined hands with
University Publish­ing Company, Inc. on the plea of due process in his
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insisted that he was not a
party to this litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of this Court, on June 16, 1965, extensively dwelt
on the <span class="SpellE">dur</span> process plea of Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It may be worth noting again that Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
started the negotiation which culminated in the contract between the parties,
signing said contract as president of University Publishing Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise he was the one who made partial
payments up to the amount of P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for and in
behalf of University Publishing Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also appeared not only as a witness but as lawyer, signing some
pleadings or motions in defense of University Publishing Co., Inc., although in
other instances it is one of his associates or member of his law firm who did
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Known is the fact that even a duly
existing corporation can only move and act through natural persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case it was Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> who moved and acted as or for University Publishing
Co., Inc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is elemental that the courts can only decide the merits of
a given suit according to the records that are in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in the two pre­vious cases
decided by this Court, the first, awarding damages (L-9300), the second,
clarifying the amount of P15,000.00 awarded as such (L-15275), the corporate
existence of University Publishing Co., Inc., as a legal entity was merely
taken for granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, when the said issue was squarely presented before
the court, and University Publishing Co., Inc. chose to keep the courts in the
dark by withholding pertinent documents and papers in its possession and
control, perforce this Court had to decide the points raised according to the
records of the case and whatever related matters necessarily included therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, as a consequence of the certification
of the Securities and Exchange Commis­sion that its records do not show the
registration of University Publishing Co., Inc., either as a corporation or
partnership' this Court concluded that by virtue of its non-registration it
cannot be considered a corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
further said that it has therefore no personality separate from Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> and that <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> was in
reality the one who answered and li­tigated through his own law firm as
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, we found that
<span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> was in fact, if not in name, the defendant
(Decision, P. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Judge of
the court of first instance wrote in his decision thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Defendant <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
(all along the judge who pens this decision considered that the defendant here
is the president of the University Publishing Co., Inc. since it was he who
really made the contract with Justice Albert).' (Decision of CFI, p. 9, quoted
in plaintiff-<span class="GramE">appellant' s</span> brief, p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this portion of the decision made by the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> was never questioned by the defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above statement made by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in
its decision compelled this Court to carefully examine the facts surrounding
the dispute starting from the time of the negotiation of the business
proposition, followed by the signing of the contract considered the benefits
received; took into account the partial payments made, the litigation
conducted, the decisions rendered and the appeals undertaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After thus considering the facts and
circumstances, keeping in mind that even with regard to corporations shown as
duly registered and existing, we have in many a case pierced the veil of
corporate fiction to administer the ends of justice, (Arnold vs. Willits &amp;
Patterson, Ltd. 44 Phil. 634; Koppel (Phil.), Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>,

fiction - in view of its non-registration per the evidence -so that from the

Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> not being a formal party defendant in

elevated to this Court for the fourth time in L-19118, we made it abundantly
clear in the decision therein rendered and in the resolution issued thereafter,
that the judg­ment rendered against University Publishing Company, Inc. could
and should be enforced against respondent Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our language in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the order appealed from is hereby set
aside and the case remanded ordering the lower court to hold supplementary
proceedings for the purpose of carrying the Judgment into effect against
University Publishing Co., Inc. and/or Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The judgment does not contemplate of any
proceeding other than for the purpose of carrying into effect the judgment
against University Publishing Company, Inc. and/or Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
- which is the proceeding on execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not admit of any other interpretation such as that which is
advocated by <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> that such proceeding "is to
show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why the judgment should be carried into
effect against either the University Publishing Co., Inc. and/or Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>." Indeed, the issue of whether or not the judgment
rendered against University Publishing Company, Inc. could be enforced against
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> had already been definitely decided in
that case, L-19118.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even worse, all the
arguments and evidence presented by <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> before the
respondent court resulting in the orders that gave rise to the present
proceedings had been previously adduced before this Court and decided ad­versely
against him in the January decision and the June resolu­tion of 1965 in
L-19118.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no clearer case
for the principle of conclusiveness of judgment to apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in certiorari and prohibition
proceedings brought by the Manila Underwriters Insurance Co., Inc. against
Judge <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> A. Tan, L-17445, November 27, 1964,
this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"On August 15, 1960, respondent <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
filed another motion in the same case asking the court to require petitioner
again to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why it should not be made liable
under its bond, and there­after to issue a writ of execution against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner opposed the motion on the <span class="GramE">ground</span> that our decision in 107 Phil., 911; had finally
disposed of the issue raised therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite this, the respondent judge, on August 30, 1960 issued an order
citing petitioner to appear before it and show <span class="GramE">cause</span>
why it should not be held liable under its bond, and on September 10 of the
same year, his honor also denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration of
said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the present action
was filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon the undisputed facts stated heretofore, it appears
abundantly clear that the respondent judge seriously erred in issuing the
orders complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of
whether petitioner could still be held liable upon its bond must be deemed
finally settled by our decision in 107 Phil., 911; and any attempt to hold
petitioner liable upon the bond already mentioned must necessarily be deemed as
an improper attempt to reopen a case already finally adjudicated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the orders complained of are hereby declared void
and of no legal force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
writ of preliminary injunction issued in this case on October 26, 1960 is
hereby made final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against respondent <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The liability of <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
has been established so plainly in the decision and resolution in L-19118 that
there could not be any quibbling as to the import of the words there used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Case L-19118 was brought into being because
precisely Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> ruled that execution could
not be issued against Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> upon the ground,
so he said in his appealed order, that <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> was not
a party to the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court there
reversed Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the circumstances of this case, we are constrained to
articulate a number of possibilities:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
either (1) did not read our decision in L-19118, January 30, 1965, and our
resolution in the same case promulgated on June 16, 1965; or (2) having read,
did not comprehend their import; or (3) having read and understood, wantonly
ignored them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the thinking of this
<span class="GramE">Court,</span> however, that Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> simply shunted aside our said deci­sion and
resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not have overlooked
the fact that it was his own order of September 9, 1961 denying execution -
because <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> is not a party to this case - which
was appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That very
question of whether execution should issue against <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
was squarely presented and as squarely resolved in the affirmative by this
Court in L-19118.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> should have
insisted in his opinion after his attention to this Court's decision and
resolution adverse thereto had been <u>repeatedly</u> called by plaintiff, is
an act which deserves unsympathetic and unqualified con­demnation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
need not be reminded that the Supreme Court, by tradition and in our system of
judicial admin­istration, has the last word on what the law is; it is the final
arbiter of any <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Justiciable</span></span>

Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>

his mission of deciding cases, that the application of a doctrine promulgated
by this Superiority is against his way of reasoning, or against his conscience,
he may state his opinion on the matter, but rather than disposing of the case
in accordance with his personal views he must first think that it is his duty
to apply the law as interpreted by the Highest Court of the Land, and that any
deviation from a principle laid down by the latter would unavoidably cause, as
a sequel, unnecessary inconveniences, delays and expenses to the
litigants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if despite of what is
here said, a judge, still believes that he cannot follow Our rulings, then he
has no other alternative than to place himself in the position that he could
properly avoid the duty of having to render Judgment on the case concerned

<blockquote>2. We now come to the cry of injustice proffered by respondent Jose
M. <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even upon a cursory examination of his gripe, his position at once loses
leverage; the potency of his arguments vanishes.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As we look in retrospect at the facts, we find that it was <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> who executed the contract as president of the
University Publishing Company, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
is a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time he executed the
contract with plaintiff, he should have known that the possibil­ity existed
that the records of the corporation had been destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, it is a matter of public knowledge that
buildings which kept public records in the City of Manila had been razed by
fire during the last war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should have
at least inquired whether the re­cords of the corporation in the Securities and
Exchange Commission had been saved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, he knew and should have known that persons dealing with corporations
are wont to look to records of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the
existence or non-existence thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this particular case, from the documents he himself presented in the court
below (after he had knowledge of the fact that admission thereof was denied by
this Court in L-19118), he is practically the corporation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because out of the capital stock of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, he subscribed to P1,600.00, and out of the paid
subscription of P500.00, he contributed the sum of P450.00, leaving but P50.00
to be spread amongst the minor stockholders.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was filed and concluded as against the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When finally, plaintiff's
counsel and the Sheriff came to him as president (and incidentally counsel) of
University Publishing Company, Inc. for execution of that judgment, he sought
to stave off satisfaction thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
plaintiff's counsel and the Sheriff came to know that the corporation did not
legally exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
could have very easily caused the corporation to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or did he think that the corporation could
evade payment, since the records of the corporation in the Securities and
Exchange Commission had not yet been reconstituted? The resultant effect is
that after long years of litigation, plaintiff is still left holding the
bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court noted in L-19118, it
would be too late for the plaintiff to file suit against <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, by then prescription
has set in.</p>

<p class="BODY">Canon 22 of the Canons of Legal Ethics is a constant reminder to
the members of the Bar that the conduct of a lawyer before the court
"should be characterized by candor and fairness"; and it is"
unprofessional and dishonorable to deal other than candidly with the facts x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in the presentation of
causes." When the question of whether execution should issue against Jose
M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, a
(member of the Bar, did emerge before the lower court in the proceedings for
execution of the judgment, candor and fairness should have impelled him to tell
the court that the representation of counsel for plaintiff that University
Publishing Company, Inc. is not a corporation, was not true, and that the
corporation had the papers and documents to show otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not have kept this fact under wraps
for so long a time while the execution proceedings were still with the lower
court and before judgment on the appeal taken by plaintiff in L-19118.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has failed in these.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Literally, he laid an ambush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after he realized that this Court
considered him as the real party in interest that he presented the fact of
corporate existence to this Court to overturn the decision rendered in
L-19118.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a party "has taken a
position with regard to procedure, which has been acted or relied on by his
adversary or by the court," he must be held to be in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
"from taking an inconsistent position respecting the same matter in the
same proceeding, to his adversary's prejudice."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the first time that this Court has ordered the
execution of a judgment against a person who was not formally named as party

this Court's stand has been consistent that the judgment for payment of back
salaries of officers entitled to reinstatement may, in effect, be enforced
against the city or municipality, although not by name <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
in the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
are concretely expressed in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mangubat</u></span> vs. <span class="SpellE"><u>Osmeña</u></span>, <u>supra</u>, in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"The necessity of making the City a respondent herein is based
upon its right to defend itself, as demanded by the requirements of due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, these requirements
have been substantially complied with in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties herein have handled the case, and
the same was heard and decided in the lower court, as if the City had been
named respondent in the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
officer required by law to cause ‘to be defended all suits against the City’,
namely, its mayor (Sec. 8, Com­monwealth Act No. 58), is respondent in his
official capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The officer charged
with the duty to represent the City 'in all civil cases wherein the city x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> is a party' - to wit, its
city attorney (Sec. 17, Commonwealth Act No. 58) - is counsel for respondents
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition thereto, the
auditor, the treasurer and even the municipal board of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, are parties respondents.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no reason to believe that these officers and the
City Mayor would have exerted greater efforts than those already displayed by
them, in protecting the interests of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
were it formally a respondent 'herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is only logical to expect that, having been individually
named as respondents, said officers must have taken as much concern, if not
more, in warding off petitioners' claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the foregoing circumstances, we would be subordinating the
substance to the form if the action for mandamus -insofar as the claim for back
salaries is concerned - were either dismissed or remanded to the lower court,
for the corresponding amendment of the pleadings and a repetition of the
proceedings held for the last five (5) years, in order to reach the same
decision rendered by the lower court and the same conclusions set forth in this
decision, as regards the substantive rights of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our considered opinion, therefore, that
the ends of justice and equity would be served best if the inclusion of the
City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, as one of the respondents herein, were
considered a mere formality and deemed effected, as if a formal amendment of
the pleadings had been made."</blockquote>
