find­ing him guilty of rape, sentencing him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and ordering him to pay Virginia <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> an indemnity of twelve thousand pesos (Criminal
Case No. <span class="GramE">L-1055).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing a brief, the Solicitor General submitted a
manifestation recommending the acquittal of the accused on the ground that his
guilt was <span class="GramE">not</span> proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant Virginia <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, 21, an
elementary school graduate, testified that on <st1:date year="1973" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1973</st1:date> the spouses <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mendiguarin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>
Fernandez went to her parents' house located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Binmaley</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pangasinan</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They hired her as a helper to sell glassware
in their store located at <st1:city><st1:place>Santa Cruz</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> at a salary of one hundred pesos a month
with free board and lodging.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a helper, she used to accompany <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>
in selling glassware in <span class="SpellE">Palauig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masinloc</span>
and other towns in <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She admitted that on one occasion or on
December 3 or 17, 1973, after selling glassware, she and <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>
stayed in a room of the Holy Family Hotel at <span class="SpellE">Masinloc</span>
where <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> tried to embrace her but she allegedly
pushed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They dallied in that room
for fifteen minutes (45-47 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1978</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, at the preliminary investigation,
she admitted that she was embraced and kissed by <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>
inside the hotel room where they stayed for thirty minutes (70-72 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="2">Feb. 12, 1975</st1:date>,

told her to lie down on the floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">She resisted, kicked <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> and pushed
him away but she did not shout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she
was trying to get up, <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>, who was unarmed, boxed
her on the thighs and abdomen several times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He threatened to kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
stripped her of her bikini-<span style="">type panty
over her resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He removed his
brief, went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>'s
version, by that time, she was already weak and no longer able to resist
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able to consummate the
sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She allegedly felt
pain and she cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about half an
hour, she told <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> that he was a beast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He retorted that she should not shout because
the deed was already accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
told <span class="SpellE">Genaro's</span> wife that he had raped her but his wife
did not say anything.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>,
<span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>, his wife and his father consulted a lawyer in
the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Binmaley</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and inquired whether Virginia and <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> could get
married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer said that they could
not get married because <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> was already married.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state> did not
attempt to escape or leave the house although her parents lived in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in the same <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Binmaley</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the place where she was alle­gedly
raped, she could go to her barrio by means of a <span class="SpellE">calesa</span>
or tricycle which passed on the road near the house of <span class="SpellE">Genaro's</span>
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She explained that <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> allegedly guarded her or was always following her.</p>

<p class="BODY">She admitted in her testimony and affidavit that on the night of
the following day, September 13, she had voluntary sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> two times in the same house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the succeeding night of September 14, she
consented to have sexual intercourse with him two times (42, 43 and 47 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="11">Novem­ber 29,

 14, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, she signed
in the municipal building a statement in English typed by a policeman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that statement she declared that she had
voluntary sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> and that she
regarded </span>him as her common-law husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Roger Salomon, Gil <span class="SpellE">Guarin</span> and Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Guarin</span> signed as witnesses in the said statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1 or D).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 17, 1974 or five days after the alleged rape, Jose <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, the father of Virginia, accompanied by two
policemen and a councilor, fetched Virginia and brought her to their home in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
at first did not want to go with her father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, she tried to hide behind the kitchen door (150 and 183 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="2">Feb. 13, 1975</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3 and F).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, September 18, she was examined by the
municipal health officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that
two fingers could be inserted into her vagina, that her hymen was lacerated at
the four and ten o'clock positions, that there was bleeding in her vaginal
wall, that there were blood clots near the vaginal ori­fice and that she
complained of chest and <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span> pains.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The local police did not
file any complaint for rape most probably because she had already signed a
statement on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="9"><span style="">September 14, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> admitting that she had voluntary sexual
intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, her father reported the alleged
rape to the Constabulary detachment at <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">She executed a statement
before Sergeant N. <span class="SpellE">Galsim</span> wherein she stated that she
was allegedly raped by <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> in the afternoon of
September 12, 1974; that his wife told her not to worry because <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> would marry her; that, however, </span>a lawyer told
her that they could not get married because <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>
was already married; that she signed an affidavit wherein she stated that she
was willing to live with <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> as his common-law
wife and that she had sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>,
twice on September 12, twice on September 13 and twice on September <span style="">14, 1974 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1974</st1:date>
she filed a complaint for rape against <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> with
the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The information for rape was filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> was arrested only on <st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1978</st1:date> at <span class="SpellE">Iba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At his
arraignment <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November
 9, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, he pleaded
not guilty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Genaro's</span> defense at the trial was that
he and Virginia were sweethearts; that he had sexual intercourse with her on
December 17, 1973 at the Holy Family Hotel in <span class="SpellE">Masinloc</span>;
that he had several trysts with her in the house of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Masinloc</span> whenever they went to that place to sell
glassware and that he and Virginia eloped on September 12, 1974 and went to his
father's house at Barrio Pallas where they had sexual intercourse daily up to
September 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of police and a
policeman testified at the preliminary investigation as to the signing by <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
of her statement regarding her elopement with <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> de Vera, a neighbor of <span class="SpellE">Genaro's</span> father, tes­tified at the preliminary
investigation that on <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="9">September 18,
 1974</st1:date> when Virginia and her father returned to the house of <span class="SpellE">Genaro's</span> father to get her clothes, he saw <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> embracing her (176 and 178 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
<st1:date year="1975" day="13" month="2">Feb. 13, 1975</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">When <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
testified on <st1:date year="1978" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1978</st1:date>,
she was already twenty-five years old; she was residing at <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and she was living with her common-law husband,
Guillermo de Guzman, a married man with six children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
had be­gotten a child with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
started living together on <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="7">July 31,
 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether Virginia <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>
was raped by <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendiguarin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the trial court erred in
rendering the judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rape was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are significant indications in the
record that <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> and <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
committed simple fornication which is not a crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances that Virginia admitted that she and <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> embraced and kissed each other in a hotel room long
before the alleged rape, that she did not tenaciously resist the alleged
ravishment, that there were no external injuries on her <span style="">body to show that actual physical violence was used against her, that
she did not shout, that she did not run or escape, that she continued to have
sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span> in the house where his
wife was staying and that she did not want to leave that house when her father
fetched her, point to the conclusion that their sexual intercourse was induced
by the chemistry and electricity of mutual attraction and desire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court already observed that the books disclose many
instances of trumped-up charges of rape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In rape cases the testimony of the offended woman should not be received
with precipitate credulity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
uncorroborated testimony should not be accepted unless her sincerity and candor
are free from suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little
insight into human nature is of utmost value in judging matters of this kind
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>, 51 Phil. 852; People vs. Ramos,
35 Phil. 671, 676).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the uncorroborated testimony of the complainant as
to the rape is not convincing and trustworthy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her behavior after the alleged rape was not that of a woman who had
suffered a shameful and grievous outrage.<span style="">&nbsp;
