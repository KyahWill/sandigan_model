				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In these two cases, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Badoy</span>, Jr. avers that
he is a candidate for delegate to the Constitutional Convention for the lone
district of North <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>; and pursuant to Sec. 19
of R.A. NO. 6132, he prays in L-32546 that Sec. 12(F) of the law be declared
unconstitutional as the same denies:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>individuals, who are not candidates, their freedom
of speech and of the press; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>candidates the right to speak and write,
discuss and debate either in favor of their candidacies or against the
candidacies of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>others. </blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Petitioner in G.R. No. L-32551
prays<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that Sec. 12(F) of R.A. No. 6132 be so
construed as to allow the printing and publication of comments and articles for
or against a candidate, which are<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>not
paid</u>, without mentioning the names of all the other candidates with equal
prominence (underscoring supplied); and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolution
No. <span style="">RR-724 be</span> declared
unconstitutional in so far as it prohibits the printing and publication of such
comments and articles, which are <u>not paid</u>, unless the names of all the
other candidates are mentioned with equal prominence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">However, after the filing of the
herein petitions, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had amended paragraph 6
of its Resolution No. RR-724 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of </span><st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="9"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">September </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">8, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
by promulgating Resolution No. RR-739 on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="9"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">September 29, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, which limits the prohibition in said paragraph </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">6 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of Resolution No. RR-724 to the publication of <u>paid</u>
comments or <u>paid</u> articles without mentioning the names of all the other
candidates with equal prominence; and the pertinent portion of paragraph 6 as
thus amended merely restates the ban in Sec. 12(F) of R.A. No. 6132.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the relevant portion of paragraph </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">6 </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of Resolution No. RR-724 as amended no longer
prohibits the printing and publication of unpaid comments or unpaid articles
without mentioning the names of all other candidates with equal prominence, which
is the correct inter­pretation of Sec. 12(F) of R.A. No. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">6132, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the same renders moot and academic the petition in
G.R. No. L-32551.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, We
cannot declare as unconstitutional that portion of paragraph </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">6 of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Comelec</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Reso­lution No. RR-724 as amended by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolution No. RR-739, which reads thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
Space, <span style="">xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span></span>
it shall be unlawful for any newspaper, magazine or periodical to print or
publish or cause to be printed or published any advertisement, paid comment or
paid article in <span style="">furtherance </span>of
or in opposition to the candidacy of <span style="">any
</span>person for delegate, or mentioning the name of any candidate and the
fact of his candidacy, unless all the names of all the other candidates in the
districts in which the candidate mentioned is running are also mentioned with
equal prominence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> <span class="SpellE">xx</span> x"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In G.R. No. L-32546, petitioner
insists on his challenge that Sec. 12(F) of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">R.A. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No. 6132
is unconstitutional, because it unduly abridges the freedom of expression of an
individual, whether candidate or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Freedom of expression is not
immune to regulation by the State in the exercise of its police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of the abridgment is gauged by
the extent of its inroad into the domain of the liberty of speech and of the
press, when subjected to the applicable clear-and-present danger rule or the
balancing-of-­interests test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
restriction on the invaded freedom is so narrow that the basic liberty remains,
then the limitation is constitutional.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It should be first stressed that,
as long as the publisher is a juridical person or an organized group of persons
of whatever nature, whether in the business of publishing a newspaper, maga­zine
or periodical only for this particular election or not, any advertisement or
article published by a publisher for or against any candidate, paid or unpaid
by said publisher, is prohibited as an organized group support under paragraph
1 of Sec. 8(a) of R.A. No. 6132.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Paragraph F of Sec. 12 reads thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Commission on Elections shall endeavor to obtain free
space from newspapers, magazines and periodicals which shall be known as <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space, and shall allocate this space equally and
impartially among all candidates within the areas in which the newspapers are
circulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside of said <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space, it shall be unlawful to print or publish, or
cause to be printed or published, any advertisement, paid comment or paid
article in fur­therance of or in opposition to the candidacy of any person for
delegate, or mentioning the name of any candidate and the fact of his
candidacy, unless all the names of all other candidates in the district in
which the candidate is running are also mentioned with equal prominence. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Said paragraph F contemplates the
following situations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><st1:place>I.</st1:place> With or Without <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
Space </p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any advertisement, paid comment or paid
article by the candidate or by a non-can­didate who is a natural person,
published in a newspaper, magazine, or periodical for or against a candidate,
or mentioning the name of any candidate, and the fact of his candidacy, must
mention the names of all other candidates in the same district with equal
prominence, in order that such pub­lication will not fall under the ban.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to unpaid comments or unpaid
articles, published in any newspaper, magazine, or periodical, the names of all
the other candidates need not be mentioned.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">II. If <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Space is Obtained in a
Newspaper, Magazine, or Periodical -</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space
must be allocated by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> "equally and
impartially among all candidates within the areas in which the newspapers are
circulated," free for all such candidates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside said <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
space, any advertisement, paid comment or paid article by any candidate or non-candidate
who is a natural person, and published in the same or another newspaper,
magazine or periodical, for or against a candidate or mentioning the name of
any candidate and the fact of his candidacy, must mention all the names of all
the other candidates in the same district with equal prominence, to remove the
same from the operation of the prohibition.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any unpaid comment or unpaid article of the
same nature or content published in any newspaper, magazine, or periodical need
not mention the names of all the other candidates.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The expenses for such ad, comment
or article incurred by the candidate or by any other person with the knowledge
and consent of the candidate, shall be counted as part of the amount of
thirty-two thousand pesos (P32,000.00), the maximum total fixed by the law
which the candidate can lawfully spend for his candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(see par. G of Sec. 12)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Under the challenged paragraph F
of Sec. 12, the moneyed candidate or individual who can afford to pay for
advertisements, comments or articles in favor of his candidacy or against the
candi­dacy of another or which mention his name and the fact of his candi­dacy,
is required to mention all the other candidates in the same district with equal
prominence, to exempt him from the penal sanction of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evident purpose of this limitation on the
freedom of the candidate or his sympathizer to spend his own money for his
candidacy alone and not for the furtherance of the candidacy of his opponents,
is to give the poor candidates a fighting chance in the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the mere mention of the
poor opponent in the same advertisement or paid article does not by itself
alone engender perfect equality of chances; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">at </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">least the
chance of the poor candidate for victory is improved because thereby his name
will be exposed to the reading public in the same article as that of the
wealthy candidate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The same is true with respect to
the candidate who can afford to pay only for an advertisement or comment or
article in his favor, and is without funds for the additional space needed to
accommodate the names of the other candidates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If the wealthy candidate or the
one who can afford only to meet the campaign expenses for his own candidacy
alone, is discouraged thereby to pay for any campaign advertisement, comment or
article in his favor, then the parity of chances in winning the election among
the poor, the not-so-poor, and the rich candidates is further enhanced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">But the restriction in the
challenged paragraph F of Sec. 12, is only one of the measures devised by the
law to preserve suffrage pure and un­defiled and to achieve the desired
equality of chances among </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">all </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the can­didates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Considering the foregoing
limitation in paragraph F, Sec. 12 in the light of the other provisions of R.A.
No. 6132 designed to maximize, if not approximate, equality of chances among
the various candidates in the same district, the said restriction on the
freedom of expression appears too insignificant to create any appreciable dent
on the individual's liberty of expression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">More than compensating for the
minor limitation on the freedom of expression of an individual delineated in
Sec. 12(F), R.A. No. 6132 affords him several facilities and other forms of
assistance by which he can fully exercise his freedom of expression, including
freedom of assembly, namely:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 50-B of the Revised Election Code as
amended by R.A. No. 4880 limiting the period of election campaign shall not
apply to the election of delegates (Sec. 6 [B]);</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each candidate is entitled to utilize for
his campaign all the members of his family within the fourth civil degree of
consanguinity or affinity;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each candidate can employ a personal cam­paign
staff composed of one for every ten precincts in his district;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each candidate cannot be refused a permit to
hold a public meeting on the ground that the pro­visions of this paragraph a,
Sec. 8, may be violated;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any member of any political party, organiza­tion
or organized group of whatever nature, acting individually, can campaign for or
against any can­didate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All organizations or organized groups of
whatever nature are allowed to disseminate informa­tion or advocate
constitutional reforms or proposals, which may be the same constitutional
reforms or pro­posals advocated by the candidate, without of course mentioning
the candidate directly or indirectly (Sec. 8 [a], par. 1, R.A. 6132);</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
billboard in every city, munici­pality, municipal district and barrio of
sufficient population density to be allocated by lottery by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> equally and impartially among them;</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> time from
each radio broadcasting and television station at least one hour but not more
than two hours at least once a week also to be allo­cated by lottery by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> equally and impartially among the candidates within
the area of coverage of said station;</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A candidate may appear on any interview or
program in any radio broadcasting or television sta­tion, movie house or
theater, provided all the other candidates are also invited to appear; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>News coverage by the mass media of signi­ficant
or newsworthy events, views, public meetings or rallies involving any candidate
in any news program, newsreel, newspaper, magazine, or other periodicals is
allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(see pars. A, B, C, E and H of
Sec. 12)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To implement the foregoing
facilities and to increase the chances of the poor candidate as against the
wealthy opponent as well as to insure free, orderly and honest election, in
addition to the penal sanctions provided for in the Revised Election Code, R.A.
No. 6132 prohibits, with penalties:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Political party or organized group support,
whether material or otherwise (par. 1 of Sec. 8[a]);</blockquote>

executive department, bureau or office, official or officer nominated or
appointed by the President of the Philippines, head or appointed officer of any

8[a]);</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any public officer, head, official or

association; or any head, minister, officer, or authority of any religion,
religious, fraternal, civic or social organization, directly or indirectly,
from <u>coercing</u> any of their subordinates, employees, tenants, members,
affi­liates, parishioners, or followers, as the case may be, to aid, campaign,
vote for or against any candi­date, which coercion may include (underscoring
supplied): </blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Against the background of such
facilities accorded by the law for all candidates, rich and poor alike, and the
prohibitions as well as penal sanctions to insure the sanctity of the ballot
against desecration and the equality of chances among the candidates, the
restriction on the freedom of expression of the candidate or any other
individual prescribed in par. F of Sec. 12 is so narrow as not to affect the
substance and vitality of his freedom of expression itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The questioned ban on Sec. 12(F)
is even less restrictive than the prohibitions in R. A. 4880.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1) unanimously
upheld as valid the provision in said Republic Act 4880 limiting the period for
nomination of candidates of any elective public office voted for at large
earlier than 150 days immediately preceding an election, and for any other
elective public office earlier than 90 days immediately preceding an election;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by six votes sustained the constitutionality
of the provision of the same law limiting the period for the conduct of an
election campaign or partisan political activity, even if the partisan activity
consists of (a) forming organizations, associations, clubs, committees or other
groups of persons for the purpose of soliciting votes and/or undertaking any
campaign or propaganda for or against a party or candidate; (b) holding
political conventions, cau­cuses, conferences, meetings, rallies, parades or
other similar assemblies for the purpose of soliciting votes and/or undertaking
any campaign or propaganda for or against any candidate or party; and (c)
giving, soliciting, or receiving contributions for election campaign either
directly or indirectly (Sec. 50-B, pars. [a], [b], and [c], R.A. 4880); and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) because four
Members dissented, failed to declare as unconstitutional the limitation on the
period for (a) making speeches, announcements or commentaries or holding
interviews for or against the election of any party or candidate for public
office, (b) publishing or distributing campaign literature or materials, and
(c) directly or indirectly soliciting votes and/or undertaking any campaign or
propaganda for or against any candidate or party specified in Sec. 50-B, pars.
(c), (d), and (e) of R.A. 4880.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As heretofore stated, Sec. 6(B) of
R.A. 6132 expressly excludes the application of Sec. 50-B of R.A. 4880 limiting
the period of election campaign to the election of delegates to the
Constitutional Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 12(F)
does not limit the period of campaign.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And as a matter of fact, under par. 1 of Sec. 8(a) any individual,
whether a member of a political party or organized group or not, can campaign
for or against any candidate as long as he does so as an individual and not as
a member of such party or organized group.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If the aforementioned limitations
in R.A. 4880 were deemed valid restrictions on the due process clause, freedom
of expression, freedom of association, right to equal protection of the laws
and free­dom of peaceful assembly, <u>a fortiori</u> the less narrow or less
restric­tive inhibition embodied in Sec. 12(F) of R.A. 6132 should survive the
constitutional test.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Just recently, Five Members of
this Tribunal upheld the validity of paragraph 1 of Section 8(a) of R.A. No.
6132, prohibiting any political party or any organization or any organized
group of whatever nature, from giving aid or support, directly or indirectly,
material or other­wise, for or against a candidate; while Six Members sustained
the constitutionality of the prohibition against such support from poli­tical
parties only.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The ban in said par. 1 of Sec. 8(a) is, We believe,
more restrictive than the limitation contained in Section 12(F).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hence, consistent with our opinion
expressed in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Imbong</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> this slight limi­tation of the freedom of expression
of the individual, whether candi­date or not, as expressed in par. F of Sec.
12, is only one of the many devices employed by the law to prevent a clear and
present danger of the perversion or prostitution of the electoral apparatus and
of the denial of the equal protection of the laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The fears and apprehensions of
petitioner concerning his liberty of expression in these two cases, applying
the less strin­gent balancing-of-interests criterion, are far outweighed by the
all important substantive interests of the State to preserve the purity of the
ballot and to render more meaningful and real the guarantee of the equal
protection of the laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Special recognition should be made
of the circumspection with which Congress couched the limitation in par. F of
Sec. 12, revealing its deep respect for the freedom of expression guaranteed in
the Bill of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted
that Congress did not impose on the publishers of newspapers, magazines and
periodicals the duty to allocate for free a <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
space in their newspapers, magazines or periodicals, but merely required the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to endeavor to acquire such free <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space for the benefit of all the candi­dates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress thereby realized that to compel the
publishers to provide free <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space would be an
undue abridgment of the publisher's own freedom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Under the guarantee of free expression,
the candidate who pays for a comment or an article has the duty not only to
inform the elec­torate about his qualifications and proposals for
constitutional reforms, but also to <u>inform truthfully</u> the public who his
opponents are, so that the public or particularly the electorate can determine
the truth and merit of his claims <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> those of
the other candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other­wise, the
candidate will be guilty of gross unpardonable deceit on the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This duty on the part of the candidate was
underscored by John Milton in his stirring rhetorical denunciation of the
suppression of truth as he appealed for "the liberty to know, to utter and
to argue freely <u>according to conscience</u>, above all liberties"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (underscoring supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same duty was stressed by Mr. Justice
Murphy speaking for the American Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Thornhill</span>
vs. Alabama</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> when he delineated the contours as well as facets of
the freedom of expression as "the freedom to publish publicly and <u>truthfully</u>
all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent
punishment " (underscoring supplied).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The candidate, to enjoy the
freedom, therefore has the con­comitant duty to campaign for himself truthfully
<u>according to his conscience</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
he is not truthful, he forfeits the freedom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His freedom of expression is not and should not be limited to his own
personal right to know the truth of the claims of the other candi­dates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A candidate is prone to exaggerate his
personal merits or qualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
invariably claims qualifications superior to those of his opponents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One test of the truth of his own pretensions
as against those of his opponents is to require him to mention the names of the
other candidates so that the electorate will know how to judge all the candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the candidate omits the names of his
opponents he is guilty of deception, which nullifies his right to enjoy the
liberty he invokes for himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, he usually mentions his opponents in an oral harangue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must likewise do so in printed propaganda,
so that the voter can decide who is the better man who can best represent in
the constitutional convention their interests and articulate their longings and
aspirations for an abundant life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intrinsic
merit of the candidate as a person and of his proposed amendments, not his
wealth or lack of it, must be decisive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gauged by the more liberal
"balancing-of-interests test", We must exercise judicial restraint in
passing upon the statute challenged as unconstitutionally encroaching upon the
realm of free expression and hearken to the caution pronounced by Mr. Jus­tice
Frankfurter in his concurring opinion in Dennis vs. U.S. that "free speech
cases are not an exception to the principle that we are not legislators, that
direct policy-making is not our province.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How best to reconcile competing interests is the business of the
legislature and the balance they strike is a judgment not to be dis­placed by
ours, but to be respected, unless outside the pale of fair judgment."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We cannot with justification
pontificate that the limitation contained in Sec. 12(F) of R.A. 6132 is not a
reasoned and rea­sonable judgment on the part of Congress, which is also the
"ultimate guardian(s) of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite
as great a degree as the Courts."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Constitution and the statutes
are merely instruments of the sovereign people in their incessant quest for
security and the good life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
permanent sovereign talisman that will work magic to usher in the longed for
Utopia of Sir Thomas More or the <span class="SpellE">Shangrila</span> of James

can only approximate, for the human mind is finite and imperfect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once adopted, the Constitution and the
statutes are not to imprison forever in their cast the sovereign people, even
though these <span class="SpellE">organons</span> no longer serve the people nor
their welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this planet Earth, in
the epigrammatic language of Mr. Justice Holmes, than whom greater love hath no
man for civil liberties, without in any way withholding reverence for dogmas
cherished as eternal verities by any church or the moral code, the theory of
our Constitution is that "it is an experiment, as all life is an
experiment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every year, if not every
day, we have to wager our salvation upon some prophesy based upon imperfect
knowledge.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Because "time has upset many
fighting faiths" in the apt words of Mr. Justice Holmes,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the State must ever be resilient and con­tinuously
devise measures to meet the protean complexities of the present and future generations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The agency of the State in
fashioning instruments to generate the greatest good for the greatest number
under our present political system is Congress, as a constituent assembly
together with the elec­torate in the formulation of the organic law, or
Congress with the Pre­sident in the exercise of its ordinary law-making power
for the enact­ment of statutes designed to solve the problems that urgently
press for panaceas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either case, as
we march towards the millennium, the pro­cess that is followed is essentially
empirical, pragmatic and utilitarian - whatever social, political, economic,
legal or ideological philosophies may be employed as starting points.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as Mr. Justice Winslow of the Wisconsin
State Supreme Court said: "The political or philosophical aphorism of one
generation is doubted by the next, and entirely discarded by the third.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The race moves forward constantly, and no <span class="SpellE">Canute</span> can stay its progress."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I find it difficult to agree with
the Court's holding that the provision in question is<i> </i>a reasonable
restraint of the freedom of the press guaranteed by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, touching as it does on the right of a
candidate in an election to campaign for his own victory, I regard this provision
more repugnant to the Constitution than those I have heretofore voted to strike
down <i>as </i>unconstitutional in the cases of Gonzales v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-27833, </span></span><st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="4"><span class="GramE"><span style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;">April </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">18, 1969</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, 27 SCRA 835, and <span class="SpellE">Imbong</span> v.

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Gonzales case, I expressed
my position in regard to legislations of the nature of the one now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lest</span> I be misunderstood, however, as being an ultra-activist, it
should be clear at the outset that in holding that the above prohibitions
contained in the <span style="">statute in question </span>are
<span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the <span style="">Constitution, </span>my stand is limited to my funda­mental conviction
that the freedoms of speech, of the press and <span style="">of peaceful </span>assembly and redress of grievances <span style="">are </span>absolute when they are being
exercised in relation to our <span style="">right<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>to choose the men and women by whom we
shall be governed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hold neither candle
nor brier for licentious speech and press, but I recognize no power that can
pre-censor, much less forbid, any speech or writing, and any peaceful assembly
and petition for the redress of grievances, the purpose of which is no more
than to express one's belief regarding the qualifications or<span style=""> </span><span style="">lack
of them, </span>the merits and the demerits of persons who are candidates for
public office or of political parties vying for power, as well as the
principles and programs of government and public service they advocate, to the
end that when voting time comes the right of suffrage may be intelligently and
knowingly, even if not always wisely, exercised. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(27 SCRA 835, 924)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Withal,
since the election herein involved is that of delegates to the constitutional
convention called to amend the existing Constitution, the more it is imperative
that all the rights of all candidates and voters </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">should be </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">unrestricted and unimpaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should decry the apparent lack of interest
exhibited by our people in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">past plebiscites </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">held in connection with proposed consti</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">tutional amendments, as attested by the
comparatively low percentage of voters who have taken </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">part therein, for in a
matter of such grave importance as the amendment of the fundamental law, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it is naturally better that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the stamp of approval or <span class="GramE">disapproval</span> should be sufficiently reflective of the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">will of the greatest </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">number possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Surely, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the provision here disputed, does </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">not improve the
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rather, it gives more reason
for people to shy away from the coming </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">elections </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">because it has increased the difficulties of the
means of communi­</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">cation
between </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the
candidates and the electorate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I
recognize the necessity of keeping electoral campaign </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">practices within bounds that
will insure </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the
true expression of the popular will and generally, as </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I have manifested in past
opinions, to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Congress
should be conceded the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">choice of the means that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">should be </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">adopted
towards that end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that
it is the purpose of the enactment in question to equalize, as much as
possible, the availability of the press, meaning newspapers, magazines and
other publications to all candidates as a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">means of campaigning, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">so that the rich candidates may not have undue advantage over the poor
candidates in the use of paid advertisements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Without committing myself as to
the validity of such attempt at compulsory equality for all candidates, I do
not believe in imposing upon the rich candidates more restrictions on their
liberties, just because they are rich which is not a sin, than the limitation
of their expenses and those on their behalf to not more than P32,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if this limitation is in itself a little
questionable, considering its inadequacy due to the high costs of everything at
present, I am ready to yield in respect thereto, since it seems that a one-year-salary
limitation has been with us for such a long time already and may be considered
as already sanctioned and accepted by all to be more or less reasonable from
the point of view of its proportion to the emoluments of the office at
stake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot agree, however, that
beyond this, the candidates who can afford should be placed under other
restrictions with respect to the way they will spend the P32<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, under the provision in question, a
candidate is not only restrained and regulated in the expenditure of his P32<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> by merely limiting the kind of advertisement or
publica­tion he may make on behalf of his candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the said provision, he is also
compelled to include in his propaganda, with equal prominence <i>as </i>his
own, the names of all his opponents. In other words, there is an ele­ment of
odious compulsion in this provision, for it makes it unlawful and punishable
with imprisonment and other accessory penalties, the failure of a candidate to
spend his own money to advertise with equal prominence the candidacy of his
adversaries whenever he advertises his own candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is perhaps not far be­yond reasonableness
to restrict the advertisements of a candidate in the interest of remedying an
evil Congress may recognize, but it is to me clearly unreasonable, nay unjust
and oppressive, to compel a candidate not only to give quarters to his
adversary, but to practically help the latter by giving his name equal
prominence as his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be borne
in mind that the primary objective of a candidate in an election is to win over
his opponents and to require him, under pain of suffering imprisonment and/or
other penalties, to spend his own money in order precisely that his opponents
may be publicized with equal prominence as himself is, to my mind, an
intolerable infringement of one's freedom to pursue a legitimate objective by
ordinarily lawful means.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Going to another consequence of
the enactment in question, it is a matter of public knowledge that there <span class="GramE">are hardly any paid advertisement</span> or publications of candidates
in the newspapers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We need not mention
unpaid ones because one has to depend on the generosity of the publishers for
these.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed understandable that
candidates should hesitate or refuse to submit themselves to the imposition of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result is that there is
dearth of information regarding the candidates among the electors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is bad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">see it, the application of the disputed provision is
producing a greater evil than the one purportedly being remedied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, I would like to reiterate
what I said in the Gonzales case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I like to reiterate over and over, for it
seems this is the fundamental point others miss, that genuine democracy thrives
only where the power and the right of the people to elect the men to whom they
would entrust the privilege to run the affairs of the state exist. In the
language of the declaration of principles of our Constitution, 'The Philippines
is a republican state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sovereignty
resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 1, Article II) Translating this
declaration into actuality, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a republic because and solely because the people in it can be governed only
by officials whom they themselves have placed in office by their votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is on this cornerstone that I hold it
to be self-evident that when the freedoms of speech, press and peaceful
assembly and redress of grievances are being exercised in relation to suffrage
or as a means to enjoy the inalienable right of the qualified citizen to vote, <span style="">they </span>are abso<span style="">lute and timeless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If our democ</span>racy
and republicanism are to <span style="">be </span>worthwhile,
the conduct of public affairs <span style="">by our
officials must </span>be allowed <span style="">to </span>suffer
incessant and <span class="SpellE">unabating</span> scrutiny, favorable or
unfavorable, everyday and at all times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Every holder of power in our government must be ready to undergo
exposure any moment of the day or night, from January to December every year,
as it is <span style="">only in this way that he can </span>rightfully
gain the confidence of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
no patience for those who would regard public dissection of the establishment
as an attribute to be indulged by the people only at certain periods of
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I consider the freedoms of speech,
press and peaceful assembly and redress of grievances, when exercised in the
name of suffrage, as the very means by which the right itself to vote can only
be properly enjoyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stands to
reason, therefore, that suffrage itself would be next to useless if these
liberties cannot be <span class="SpellE">untrammelled</span> whether as to degree
or time."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I cannot help but feel
apprehensive that with the restrictions and imposition laid down by Republic
Act 6132, the constitutional convention in which many pin their hopes for the
betterment of this country may not be as representative of the true will of the
majority of our people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my
considered view that what <span class="GramE">We</span> really need is not
curtailment of the rights of the candidates and voters but, on the contrary,
more freedom for all of them in order that there may be the maximum of
information regarding the qualifications and issues of the candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only then can <span class="GramE">We</span>
hope to have better results in our elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, I would like to reiterate the views I expressed in this regard in
the Gonzales case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"My brethren view the problem be­fore <span class="GramE">Us</span>
as one calling for the reconciliation of two values in our chosen way of life -
individual freedom, on the one hand, and public welfare, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not see it that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, if the freedoms of speech, press,
peaceful assembly and redress of grievances in regard to the right to vote cam
be impinged, if not stifled, by standards and limitations fixed by those who
are temporarily in power, I would regard those freedoms as no freedoms at all,
but mere concessions of the establishment which can be reduced or enlarged as
its convenience may dictate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of what use
can such kind of freedom be?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Taking all circumstances into account, it is entirely beyond
my comprehension, how anyone could have conceived the idea of limiting the
period of electoral campaigns in this country, when what <span style="">we </span>need precisely is more intelligent
voting by the greater portion of our people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I do not believe our mass media have reached the degree of efficiency in
the dissemination of information needed to enable the voters to make their
choices conscientiously and with adequate knowledge of the bases of their
decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not convinced that at
this stage of our national life we are already prepared to enjoy the luxury of
abbreviated electoral campaigns, unless we are inclined to forever have with us
the <span style="">areas<i> </i></span>of political
bossism, apparent statistical improbabilities and politico-economic blocs and
even politico-religious control which we have in varying <span class="GramE">degrees</span>
these days and which will naturally continue as long as our people are not
better informed about the individual worth of the candidates for or against
whom they vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dare say that there is
enough reason to hold that <span style="">if<i> </i></span>mistakes
have been committed by our people in the selection of their elective officials,
it is because the information needed to serve as basis for intelligent voting
have not fully reached all segments of the population.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inadequacy of reliable information among the
voters, regarding the qualification of the candidates and the relevant
circumstances of the election they are taking part in can be the greatest bane
of popular suffrage."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I do not find anything
objectionable in the portion of the provision which would enable all candidates
to take advantage of what is called <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe this is </span><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span></i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">step in the right direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the rest, however, of Section 12 (F) of
Republic Act 6132, the provision in dispute, for the reasons stated above, I
vote to declare the same unconstitutional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

viewpoint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The copious citations of American
authorities, particularly in one of the dissents, are undeniably of no little
persuasive force, our constitutional orientation being what it is, by reason
not only of the nature of the legal training dispensed in our law schools but
also of the practical aspects of our political and juristic experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But however steadfastly one might adhere to
the fundamental principles <span class="SpellE">enunciative</span> of individual
rights and liberties, as spelled out in almost identical terms in both the
American and Philippine Constitutions, I am not so sure that their traditional
and orthodox application in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 12pt;">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> should necessarily be binding upon us under all
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed even there the
events of recent years have demonstrated that the concept of personal liberty
can be so misread that its real significance all but disappears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In not a few instances it has been invoked to
make a mockery of the administration of justice by the trial courts; to debase
the meaning of students’ academic freedom; to inspire violence and anarchy in
the streets and college campuses; and, in general, to contribute in no small
measure to a destructive divisiveness in a society that for hundreds of years
has maintained a stable if delicate balance between individual rights and civic
duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Philippines the same
principles have governed our lives, and insofar as civil relationships are
concerned have proven adequate and satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in the political field, more particularly
in connection with the conduct of elections and related activities, they have
failed to curb, if they have not indirectly abetted, the proliferating evils
that have long cried for relief, among them the hegemony of wealth, of
entrenched political organizations and dynasties, of terrorist groups, of
unabashed government patronage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law
that is here assailed as unconstitutional is a departure from the system that
has been tried so many times before and found wanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an experiment, to be sure; but it is
one which Congress, by virtue of its powers and its grasp of the problem
involved, has considered necessary to initiate; and I am not prepared to hinder
its efforts except upon the clearest showing that they not only regulate but
unjustifiably abridge individual rights and liberties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It should be remembered that the
law in question has to do with the process of amending the Constitution, or
framing an entirely new one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The task is
vital to the life of the nation, and has a character of permanence which is not
susceptible of change through periodic submission to the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates to be elected for that task
will not represent regional districts in the political sense, nor particular
social segments or interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stand
for ideas, for theories of government and civil society; and the purpose of the
law is to allow the people the freest possible choice, untrammeled by the many
election practices heretofore permitted whereby some candidates are placed at a
decided advantage because they have the logistics for effective political
campaign that are denied the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>
has stated in his opinion the challenged statute is pragmatic and empirical in
its approach to an old familiar problem; and considering how our traditional
electoral processes have failed to provide a solution, I am quite willing to
accept the trial and error method, even if we do adopt a more stringent
regulation of certain individual rights as long as such regulation is within
permissible limits, which I am convinced it is in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The holding of periodic elections constitutes the very foundation
of a republican form of government such as ours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it has aptly been remarked that "the
measure of success of a democratic system is found in the degree to which its
elec­tions really reflect rising discontent before it becomes unmanage­able, by
which government responds to it with timely redress, and by which losing groups
are self-disciplined to accept election results."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An election is the most elemental and direct act and parti­cipation
of the citizen in the conduct of government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Political power is thus entrusted by him, in concert with the entire
body of the electorate, to the leaders who are to govern the nation for a
specified period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has thus been
universally postulated that it is the government's bounden duty to see to it
that the elections are free and honest and that the voter is free from fraud,
force and corruption so that the choice of the people is freely expressed and
recorded and "the ballot box, the just index of public opinion."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
And since “many things are prerequisites to elections or may affect their
outcome - voters, education, means of transportation, health, public
discussion, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>, private animosities, even the face
and figure of the candidate(s)"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The Chief Justice, emphasizing the need for the electorate to be
informed of the specific measures and issues based upon concrete proposals for
constitutional reforms rather than general­izations, that a candidate for
delegate to the forthcoming Consti­tutional Convention intends to espouse, as

vitally important for the electorate to know, before the election of delegates,
what, in particular, are the specific measures each candidate proposes to
champion in the convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people
should not be content­ed with generalizations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They should not be satisfied with broad statements about advancing the
well-being of the collectivity, ridding the government of graft and corruption,
promoting efficiency and economy, and the other abstractions of similar nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it enough that a candidate be honest,
patriotic and learned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The school of
thought to which he belongs, the interests he repre­sents, and the precise
amendments he stands for, should count heavily in the choice of delegates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each candidate should, there­fore, raise
issues based upon concrete reforms he intends to espouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should explain to the voters why they
ought to back him up in supporting such reforms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this manner, he would help the people make

to my mind, oppress­ively and unreasonably strait-jacket the candidates as well

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the specifically

a candidate or not, to promote or oppose the candidacy of any person for
delegate to the Convention, without mentioning with equal prominence the names
of all other candidates in the district concerned, it should be stated that at
the hearing of the cases at bar, respondents chairman and members of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> acknowledged that their tentative arrangements with
newspapers, magazines and periodicals publishers to provide free "<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space" to be allocated equally among all the can­didates,
with a maximum space of twenty (20) words for each can­didate stating his
bio-data or constitutional amendment proposals had fizzled out, since there was
just not that much free space for candidates <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
close to 3,000 and that the final arrangement was that the newspapers and
periodicals would publish just the <u>names</u> of the candidates "as

<p class="BODY">And so comes the petitioner in a plight typical of the over­whelming
majority of the earnest candidates who wish to serve as delegates -- unknown
and without previous public exposure, alone and without support of any
political party or machine or political leader but perhaps worthy and deserving

opportunity to equalize his chances by being allowed, within his means and the
means of those who have faith in him, to make use of the modern media of mass
communications (the press, radio and TV) to make known to the hundred thousand
or so voters of his province his candidacy and his proposals and to try to win
their votes within the short span of two months that the Act has given him to
campaign before the election scheduled for Novem­ber 10 this year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He complains of the denial of his and the
people's constitutional rights of free expression and free press.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he is told that he may only campaign and
solicit the people's votes in person (and through the members of his family
within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity and affinity and his per­sonal
campaign staff limited to one person for every ten pre­cincts of the over 1,000
precincts spread throughout his province) as during the horse-and-buggy era of
old; that if he wants to buy newspaper space, he must also buy space for his
opponents and mention them with equal prominence; that he is totally barred
from buying any radio, TV, or movie theater time; and that all this is to
enhance his “Parity of chances in winning the election.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The challenged provision

publishing "any advertisement or article .. <u>for or against any

majority of publishers, who are juridical persons - since in this modern age of
corporations, publishers generally incorpor­ate to facilitate the doing of
business as well as to avoid personal liability in libel suits -- may not do
so, because of the Act's all-encompassing taboo on organized group
support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only individuals, i.e. natural
persons, may cause the publication of <u>unpaid</u> com­ments or articles for

competition for space, they succeed in exercising some special charm on the

newspapers, magazines and periodicals the duty to allocate free <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> space, since such compulsion "would be an
undue abridgment of the publisher's own freedom."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem to be just as grave an
abridgment of the preferred freedoms of free speech and free press to deny to
the people, whether acting individually or in concert as a group, as well as to
the individual candidates who should not be interdicted these freedoms by
virtue of their candidacy, the right and liberty of free access to the press

jus­tifies the Convention Act's abridgment of the freedoms of expres­sion,

police power, "to prevent a clear and present danger of the perversion or
prostitution of the electoral appara­tus and of the denial of the equal

criterion, declare that the "all important substantive interests of the
State to preserve the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>purity of the

<p class="BODY">The premises upon which the main opinion is based, as gleaned
from its pronouncements and those in <span class="SpellE"><u>Imbong</u></span><u>-Gonzales</u>,
may thus be restated:</p>

<blockquote>-- Excessive partisan activities and participa­tion of political
parties present a clear and present danger of debasement and prostitution of

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>-- Civic associations other
than political parties must likewise be banned, because if exempted, they would
"utilize the facilities of the campaign machine­ries which they are denying
to political parties", not­withstanding that when they "engage in a
political act­ivity to that extent it partakes of the nature of a political
organization";<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

victory of an independent candidate mainly rests on his ability to match the
resources, financial and otherwise, of the political parties or organizations
supporting his opponent”;<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Political parties and other organized groups have built-in
advantages because of their machinery and other facilities which the individual
candidate who is without any organization support, does not have, and the law
therefore bans their participation "to attain real equality of chances
among individual candidates;"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

chosen with the aid and resources of organizations cannot be expected to be
sufficiently representative of the people (and) could very well be the
spokesmen of narrow political, reli­gious or economic interest and not of the

<p class="BODY">7. <span style=""> </span>It is respectfully noted
that the above-cited premises of the main opinion are vitiated by erroneous
assumptions and conceptions, the validity of which may be questioned as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>-- Would the banning of political parties and all other
organizations in the election purify electoral pro­cess - when the self-evident
reality, as pungently ex­pressed by Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> is
that "Man is by nature gregarious, by instinct and necessity predisposed
to form societies with other men to attain in concert with them the various
goals or ends of his existence which individually they cannot achieve?"<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>-- "Without organizations like the Masonic Lodge, the <u>La <span class="SpellE">Liga</span> Filipina</u> and the <span class="SpellE"><u>Katipunan</u></span>,
we will not today be a nation. And, without that grand old <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>,
the predecessor of the present <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> and
Liberal Parties, we would not be independent" was the answer of Sen. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
who added tersely that "It is not political parties that make elections
crooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is crooked politicians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And by eliminating political parties, you
strengthen the crooked politicians because you take away the moral influence,
if not actual influence of the party leaders to keep in check the abuses of
crooked politicians;" conveying the implied suggestion that the proper
remedy is the elimination at the polls of the power and evil influence of the
crooked politician.</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Are not political parties a necessity in any republican form of
government, and as pointed out by Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>,
"it is only where political rights are denied to the people that political
parties are extinguished"<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
with the consequent elimination of all political opposition and the emergence
of authori­tarianism?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Would the ban against all party or other orga­nized support
accord the candidates equality of chances, when as is commonly known, in many
provinces it is the so-called political kingpins who control politics, the
party just being a convenient vehicle as witness the constant party switching
after every national election, and as conceded by Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
at the <span class="SpellE"><u>Imbong</u></span><u>-­Gonzales</u> hearing, these
political kingpins would con­tinue to assert their influence, in their
individual ca­pacity, in the election?<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Would not the ban against all party or organiza­tion
participation create a political vacuum that would render invincible the
position of local political kingpins with their personal political machines and
followers?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Would it not be illusory to decree by fiat that candidates
depend on their individual merits without party or organized support, when it
is precisely by gaining the support of effective and non-partisan organizations
that non-moneyed independent candidates may secure the resources, facilities
and organized action to overcome the superior financial resources of their
opponents?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as pointed out by Senator
<span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, "a common man without organization has
no chance against political leaders" and the organization ban would
deprive the common man, the laborers and the farmers "of the very tools
they need to elect their delegates."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Is organized political activity of civic associa­tions and non-political
organizations to be considered tainted, such as to justify their being banned
from the election as becoming <u>pro-<span class="SpellE">tanto</span></u>
“political organizations" when elections are nothing if not a political
process and activity wherein the people, singly and collectively, make known
their sovereign will?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Are not political parties and civic organiza­tions the best
instruments devised and evolved by the wit, knowledge and experience of men to
equalize opportunities and situations and to off-set the "built-in advantages"
of men of wealth and fortune, power and prestige, name and fame?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Even among the so-called non-partisan or independent candidates
themselves, do not some enjoy "built-in advantages" as against the
others, be they educational, material or moral, spiritual or physical?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>-- If a candidate cannot secure the active support of a political
party or responsible civic organizations or the leaders thereof individually,
would it be reasonable to expect that he could win the elec­tion all by
himself?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Is not the fact that as indicated by Senators <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> the loud and
persistent clamor of organizations brought about the amendment to the
Convention Act banning political parties from the election, the best proof of
the necessity and <span class="SpellE">effect­ivity</span> of organizations?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Does it not cast an unfair reflection on the integrity and
patriotic sense of duty of the delegate to require that he be elected
"beholden to no one" because he cannot be expected to be sufficiently
representative of the people and would be bound by narrow political, religious
or economic interests if elected with the aid and resources of organizations?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Is it not preferable, as asked by Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>
that rather than have a convention of ostensibly uncom­mitted delegates, that
the candidates “present themselves to the people with definite views in mind
which the elec­torate would assess and evaluate, accept or reject, by electing
or not electing the candidate expressing these views" for "the
essential strength of the representa­tional approach to politics and government
is exactly this -- that from a confrontation of opposing interests and opinions
in a free forum what usually emerges is what is best for the largest
number"?<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is this not after all what the constitutional
system means, as stated by Senator <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, sponsor of
the Act, -- "to encompass all the interests that exist within our society
and to blend them into one harmonious and balanced whole"?</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- May the right of the candidate and of his sup­porters to
purchase legitimate press space promoting his candidacy be so constricted as to
require them in effect to also espouse his opponents' candidacies under pain of
severe penal sanctions?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it be conceded that
the premises of the main opinion are based on erroneous assumptions and
conceptions as sought to be shown above, its conclusions justifying the
Convention Act's infringement of the basic freedoms as being within the scope
of the State's police power are necessarily vitiated by the same errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This observation is reinforced by the
established facts that the evils sought to be averted by the Act were
perversion or prostitution of the electoral process by undue domination of the
election by the political parties and by all other forms of organi­zations and
denial of equal protection of the laws to the non-moneyed independent
candidates who would not have a fighting chance against candidates of the
"establishment" (i.e. the political parties and all other
organizations).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the measures in
question, far from suppressing these evils, would foment them by denying non­political"
candidates the very freedoms of effectively appealing to the electorate through
the public media and of being supported by organized groups that would give
them at least a fighting chance to win against candidates of the political
kingpins.</p>

<p class="BODY">9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe that
the main opinion's anchoring of its ruling on the "clear-and-present
danger" criterion is tenable under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trouble is, as Professor Freund well put
it, "that the clear-and-present-danger test is an oversimplified judgment
unless it takes account also of a number of other factors: the relative
seriousness of the danger in comparison with the value of the occasion for
speech or political activity; the availability of more moderate control than
those which the state has imposed; and perhaps the specific intent with which
the speech or activity is launched. No matter how rapidly we utter the phrase
'clear and pre­sent danger', or how closely we hyphenate the words, they are

I subscribe to the views expressed last year by Mr. Justice Castro in <u>Gonzales
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
that "(H)<span class="SpellE">owever</span> useful the 'clear and present
danger' formulation was in the appraisal of a specific type of situation, there
is fairly extensive recognition that it is not a rule of universal
applicability and validity, not an automatic mechanism that relieves a court of
the need for careful scrutiny of the features of a given situation and
evaluation of the competing interests involved" and that the "clear
and present danger" test has "minimum relevance to our task" of
appraising the provisions of election statutes, such as Republic Act 4880 in
that case, which outlaws prolonged election cam­paigns and electioneering, and
Republic Act 6132 in the cases at bar, since "(T)his kind of
constitutional testing would involve both specula­tion and prophecy of a sort
for which this Court x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
has neither the inclination nor any special competence."</p>

<p class="BODY">10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would state further,
with Mr. Justice Castro's indulgence, that applying the various factors of the
"balancing­-of-interests" criterion as synthesized by him in <u>Gonzales</u>,
<u>supra</u>, to wit,</p>

<blockquote>'Although the urgency of the public interest sought to be secured
by Congressional power res­tricting the individual's freedom, and the social
importance and value of the freedom so restricted, 'are to be judged in the
concrete, not on the basis of abs­tractions,' a wide range of factors are
necessarily relevant in ascertaining the point or line of equilibrium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among these are (a) the social value and
importance of the specific aspect of the particular freedom restrict­ed by the
legislation; (b) the specific thrust of the res­triction, i.e., whether the
restriction is direct or indirect, whether or not the persons affected are few;
(c) the value and importance of the public interest sought to be secured by
legislation -- the reference here is to the nature and gravity of the evil
which Congress seeks to prevent; (d) whether the specific restriction decreed
by Congress is reasonably appro­priate and necessary for the protection of such
public interest; and (e) whether the necessary safeguarding of the public
interest involved may be achieved by some other measure less restrictive of the
protected freedom.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the main opinion's conclusion that the
State's objectives of preserv­ing the purity of the ballot and achieving the
desired equality of chances among all the candidates warrant in balance the
abridg­ment of the basic liberties falls short of satisfying the require­ments.</p>

<p class="BODY">11. It is axiomatic that the highest of motives and the best of
intentions are not enough to displace constitutional obs­tacles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Act's bans here are so broad, and
encompassing against political activity for or against a candidate by any
"<u>poli­tical party, political group, political committee, civic,
religious, professional, or other organization or organized group of what­ever
nature</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
There are so many technical prohibitions against <u>organized group</u>
activity, denying man's very nature, and so much emphasis on <u>individual action</u>
that two or more candi­dates and their 4th degree relatives and personal campaign
staffs are enjoined by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from deliberately and
regularly campaigning together or joining and mutually supporting each other,
under the severe penal sanctions prescribed by the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ban against party or organized group
support, far from equal­izing the candidates' chances, leaves a vacuum which
the local political leaders as individuals readily fill, and the candidates are
left with no choice but to seek the support of the political leaders which
makes a mockery of the <u>desideratum</u> that the candidates should be
"beholden to no one."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bans
against free access to the press instead of equalizing chances, leave the
candidates helpless in promoting their candidacy and petitioner has come to
Court for the removal of such bans so that precisely he may have a fighting
chance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tragedy of it is that the
bans are so unrealistic, "arbitrary, irrational and fascistic" in the
words of Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
and fail futilely to accomplish the objectives of the Act, whereas the Act does
contain a valid and effective limitation that "(T)he total expenditures
made by a candidate or by any other person with the knowledge and consent of
the candidate shall not exceed thirty-two thousand pesos", which, if
properly implemented, would check the very evils that the Act seeks to avert.</p>

<p class="BODY">12. The basic and crucial test that the Act fails to pass is the
constitutional test of reasonableness required by the due process clause.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Due process limits the sweeping scope of the police power of the State and 'forbids
governmental action that is unreasonable and arbitrary, or opposed to the
community's sense of fair play or to principles of liberty and justice, or not
in harmony with a scheme of ordered liberty."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
The mea­sure which is sought to be justified as falling within the police power
should bear a reasonable relation to the proper govern­mental object and should
not go so far beyond the necessity of the case as to be unreasonable,
oppressive and arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to
encroach upon the field of legislative policy but simply with the premises and
circumstances known to all, to enforce the requirements of due process that the
challenged provisions of the Act in question bear some rational or substantial
relation to the public welfare sought to be achieved, in order to justify the
abridgment of the basic freedoms of expression, press and association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Convention Act, to my mind, plainly fails
the test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The means employed and the
strictures decreed strongly tend to defeat, rather than promote, the very
objectives of the Act of preventing perversion of the electoral process and
“maximizing, if not approximating, equality of chances among the various
candidates." So enervating are the provisions and effects of the Act that
earnest candidates are left without recourse to question the candidacies of
nuisance candidates bearing the same surnames reportedly put up by their
opponents.</p>

<p class="BODY">13. Suppression of free, open and public discussion of men and issues,
particularly in times of elections, goes against our traditions of liberty and
freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>
Election Period Law (Republic Act 4880) cited in the main opinion was upheld by
the Court in <u>Gonzales</u> as a valid exercise of the police power in its banning
of year-round prolonged election campaigns and electioneering, and limiting the
campaign period to 120 days immediately preceding a national election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The measure was directly in furtherance of
the governmental objective of prevent­ing the harmful effects on the public
interest of an excessive and prolonged preoccupation with partisan political
activities, although a majority of the Court voted against the validity of the
Act's spe­cific provisions against the making of speeches for or against any candidate
during the prohibited period, etc. as being too ambi­guously and broadly drawn
to safeguard adequately the basic li­berties affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisions of the <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>
Election Period Law were basically concerned with a limitation of the period of
the election campaign and in no way trenched upon the freedoms of the people
and the candidates in the pursuit of their election campaign nor prohibited all
party or organized group support, as does the Convention Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let there be the fullest debate and discussion of the merits of
the candidates and the issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let there
be open support by political parties and organized groups of the candidates of
their choice, so that the people may know who is supporting whom, instead of
the present enforced silence and ignorance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the people are disillusioned with the political parties and with poli­ticians
in general, as was aired in the debates on the Senate floor deliberations on
the Act, it is their right to know who are the machine-backed candidates, so
that they may vote them down as in the past.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let there be freedom, within the permit­ted limits of campaign
expenditures which should be strictly enforced against the candidate
publicized, for all to extol the merits of the candidates they support or to
denounce the lack of merits of the candidates they oppose, so that the people
may be enabled to freely and knowingly exercise their sovereign will. To
paraphrase Brandeis,<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
among freemen, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent election
excesses are educa­tion and punishment for violations of the law, not
abridgment or sterilization of the rights of free speech, free press and free
association.</p>

<p class="BODY">14. The present election for delegates who will rewrite or amend
our Constitution is of the greatest significance and it is vital that the
people take the greatest interest and enjoy the fullest freedom to know the
candidates, their concrete proposals for amendments and the interests that
support them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the delegates elected
may be worthy of the people's trust and after their work is done, may say, as
Recto did in 1935, that "it was as perfect as any human institution can
hope to be perfect" with the injunction that "We are the Constitution
in the sense that it can live only in us, through us, for us, and because of
us." The fact that the office of delegate to the Constitutional Convention
is non-contentious in the sense that opposing candi­dates for national or local
offices are, does not warrant "experimenting" in the present election
with the people's basic liber­ties for possible adoption for future elections,
as manifested at the hearing hereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">For those who have enjoyed the stillness of the present non
campaign, I would recall the words of the late Woodrow Wilson who said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I have always been among those who
believed that the greatest freedom of speech was the greatest safety, because
if a man is a fool, the best thing to do is to encourage him to advertise the
fact by speaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be so easily
dis­covered if you allow him to remain silent and look wise, but if you let him
speak, the secret is out and the world knows that he is a fool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is by the exposure of folly that it is
defeated; not by the seclusion of folly, and in this free air of free speech
men get into that sort of communication with one another which constitutes the
basis of all common achievement.”<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The restrictions in Republic Act 6132 discussed in para­graph 2
hereof, together with the provision of section 12 (F) thereof directly
challenged in the cases at bar, are in my opinion inextricably linked in their
violation of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I there­fore
vote for their exclusion from the statute.</p>
