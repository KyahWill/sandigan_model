<p class="2Q">'<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Simona</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> explained that due

as Assistant Secretary-Treasurer as, as a matter of fact, he has heretofore

<blockquote>"Four or five days thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Genato</span> as Assistant Secretary-Treasurer cancelled
share certificates Nos. 7 and 18 and in lieu thereof issued share certificate
No. 118 for 265 shares in favor of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> and share certificate No. 119 for 265 shares in
favor of Francisco G. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The new share certificates were not presented in evidence;
they were merely mentioned by <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> in the course of his testimony as a witness called
by the plaintiff later on as a witness for the defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Simona</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> having died shortly after liberation, an
intestate proceeding of her estate (Special Proc. 71546, Court of First
Instance, Manila) was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inventory (Exhibit D), which did not include the shares in litigation, presented
in the proceeding by Francisco G. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> as special
administrator dated March 1, 1946 showed that the value of the estate left by
the decedent was approximately P39,806.58.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On July 8, 1948, the Philippine Trust Company, judicial
administrator of the intestate estate, and the legal heirs Manuel <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> de Lorenzo and Juan <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>
filed the complaint in the case at bar to recover from the other two legal
heirs, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>
and Francisco G. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>, the 530 shares of stock in
order that they may be included in the inventory of the intestate estate of
their deceased mother and in due course distributed among all the surviving
children of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
answer, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>
and Francisco G. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> alleged that they had
acquired the ownership of the 530 shares by simple donation from their mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court found that defendants Francisco G. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> had acquired the ownership of the 530 shares by
simple donation from their widowed mother on December 25, 1942.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the judgment dismissing the complaint,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> de
Lorenzo appealed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant contends that there was no simple donation of the
530 shares in litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the
contention meritorious in view of the following considerations:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1) There is no clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence
of the alleged simple donation of the shares in litigation having a par value
of P53,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Genato</span>, as a witness called by the plaintiffs and
subsequently as a witness for the defendants, substantially testified that on
December 25, 1942, Juan <span class="SpellE">Camus</span>, an employee of the
Corporation, came to see him at the Royal Market located on <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>
Street and told him that his mother wanted to see him; that he immediately left
and saw his mother at the residence at the back part of the premises of the
Corporation situated on R. Hidalgo Street; that his mother delivered to him the
two (2) share certificates <span class="SpellE">Nos</span> . 7 and 18, already
indorsed; that is, with the blank spaces of the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
already filled by typewriter and her signature already affixed at the bottom of
the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> and that his mother told him
'transfer them'; that two or three days later as Assistant Secretary-Treasurer
of the Corporation, he cancelled share certificates Nos. 7 and 18 and issued in
lieu thereof the new share certificates No. 118 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Genato</span> for 265 shares and No. 119 in favor of
Francisco G. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> for 265 shares.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> appearing on the
back of share certificate No. 7 (which is identical, except as to the number of
shares, to that appearing on the back of share certificate No. 18), with the
typewritten words filling the blank spaces indicated by underlines, reads as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finding that there had been neither consideration for the sale of
shares nor valid donation of the same, due to lack of proper acceptance and
non-compliance with statutory requirements, and that the appeal of respondent <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> de Lorenzo inured
to the benefit of her other co-plaintiffs, the Court of Appeals, as previously
related, in­validated the transfer of the shares to <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>, and decreed that said stock
remained a part of the estate of the transferor.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the brief of appellants, the following errors are assigned:</p>

<blockquote>1. Respondent and respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
failed to prove by preponderance of evidence that there was fraud committed by
petitioners in the transfer of the shares of stock in their names.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. There has been no showing that the transfer made by <span class="SpellE">Simona</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> of her shares of stock to petitioners was not made
validly and regularly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The evidence shows that there was a simple donation made by <span class="SpellE">Simona</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> in favor of the herein petitioners <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. The Judgment of the lower court became final with respect to the
other plaintiffs who did not appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first two errors assigned, it is immaterial
that the evidence did not show any fraudulent machinations on the part of
appellants to secure the consent of their mother to the transfer of the shares,
if the uncontested evidence of record showed that the transfer was not
supported by valid <span class="SpellE">causa</span> or consideration which in
itself is a ground for invalidating the transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so charged by the plaintiffs in the
Court of First Instance and expressly so found by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding being one of fact, reached after
consideration of the evidence, is binding upon this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, it is confirmed by the
petitioner's own claim that their mother's shares in the corporation were
donated to them, and not sold, as recited by the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
of Certificates Nos. 7 and 18 of the <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>
Commercial Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Granting that even private transactions are to be presumed fair
and regular, the presumption is only <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>, and must yield
to evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By his own testimony, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> showed that the
<span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the shares can not be taken literally,
and that it was used to disguise a different factual situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the presumption invoked, by appellants
can not apply, since they have themselves avowed the existence of a simulation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The key question, therefore, is whether there has been a valid
donation as appellants claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of Appeals concluded that there was none, and we find no reason to overturn the
opinion thus reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that the late <span class="SpellE">Simona</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> gave the
Certificates of Stock Nos. 7 and 18 to <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
with instructions to transfer the same to him and his brother, this act did not
constitute a valid manual donation in law for lack of proper acceptance (<span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Code of 1889, Art. 630).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incontestably, one of the two <span class="SpellE">donees</span> was not present at the delivery, and there is no
showing that he, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>, had authorized his
brother, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> to accept for both of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>
in his Commentaries to the Civil Code of 1889 (Vol. V, 6th edition, pp.
131-132, 141-142), the delivery by the donor and the acceptance by <span class="SpellE">donee</span> must be simultaneous, and the acceptance by a person
other than the true <span class="SpellE">donee</span> must be authorized by a
proper power of attorney set forth in a public document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None has been claimed to exist in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since by appellants' own version, the donation intended was a
Joint one to both <span class="SpellE">donees</span>, one could not accept
independently of his co-<span class="SpellE">donee</span>, for there is no
accretion among <span class="SpellE">donees</span> unless expressly so provided
(Art. 637) or unless they be husband and wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being neither valid donation, nor sale, the cancellation of
the original certificates of stock as well as the issuance of new certificates
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> was illegal and improper for lack of valid
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a consequence of this
that the shares in question are deemed never to have ceased to be property of
their mother, <span class="SpellE">Simona</span> B. de <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>,
and must be considered still forming part of the assets of her estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is finally contended by appellants that as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Genato</span> de Lorenzo
was the only one who appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance
upholding the transaction, her appeal can not inure to the benefit of the other
children of <span class="SpellE">Simona</span> de <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention would be plausible if the interest of each child
or descendant had been susceptible of individual delimitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as the estate of the mother is still
pending liquidation, the interest of each heir can not be deemed independent of
that of the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
declared by the Court of Appeals, the interests of all the heirs are so
interwoven as to become inseparable, and the appeal by one heir prevented the
appealed decision from becoming final as to the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, reversal of the Court of First
Instance decision as to one heir is reversal as to all of them (<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Orion</st1:placename></st1:place> vs. <span class="SpellE">Concha</span>,
50 Phil. 679).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Actually, none of the plaintiff heirs attempted to have himself declared owner
of any portion of the shares in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They could not do so, since the necessities of the liquidation of their
mother's estate might require the eventual disposition of all or part of the
shares to strangers in order to meet obligations of the estate.</p>
