petitioner-claimant in this proceeding, was appointed teacher in 1938 by the
Bureau of Public Schools with assignment in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Cabacungan</span>
Elementary School, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dulag</span>, province of
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, and served continuously as such until she
retired on March 23, 1975 at the age of 60 years, 5 months and 20 days as she
was suffering from coronary arteriosclerosis which disabled her from continuing
with her teaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">A claim for compensation against the Bureau of Public Schools was

any <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> to the claim in behalf of the
employer Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 12, ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">A hearing was held by the Acting Referee, Mr. Fernando T. <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span>, during which the claimant and respondent Bureau
were represented by counsel, and the parties agreed on the following
stipulations:</p>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this decision was received by the Office of the Solicitor
General on <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1975</st1:date>
(p. 17, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for

lack of merit in an Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="10">October
 22, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 19, ibid.) In

review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1975</st1:date>
the respondent Commission set aside the award of the hearing officer and
"absolved respondent Bureau from any liability under the Act as
amended." (pp. 20-22, ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Leodegaria</span> Bautista now submits that
(1) the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is null and void as
it was rendered seven days after the decision of the acting referee, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span>, had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
and (2) claimant is entitled to receive compensation for a disability caused by
an ailment which supervened and was aggravated in the course of her employment
as a public school teacher.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in petitioner's allegations.</p>

<blockquote>1. It is not disputed that the 15-day period within which to seek a
reconsideration of the referee's decision had elapsed when respondent
employer's motion for reconsideration was filed.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor was there a petition for relief from judgment filed with the Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The record of the case was perfunctorily elevated to the Commission upon the
denial of the employer's motion for reconsideration; by that time, however, and
at that stage of the proceedings the referee's decision had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To restate the ruling of this Court in the recent case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Soliven</u></span><u> vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, et
al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission reversing <span style="">that </span>of the hearing referee is null
and void when it is rendered after the referee's decision had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for failure of the employer to appeal the same
and to file a petition for relief from judgment within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Bureau contends in its memorandum filed with the Court
that the hearing officer's decision was null and void and could not have
attained finality as the "hearing officer had no jurisdiction to hear the
claim for compensation in view of the absence of any employer-employee
relationship between respondent Bureau of Public Schools and the claimant at
the time she filed her claim for compensation as she was then retired."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is however correctly claimed by petitioner that respondent
employer is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from invoking the absence of
employer-employee relationship for the simple reason that during the hearing
below the Bureau was represented by Assistant City Fiscal Jose F. Sano and
Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> Isidro who
admitted and agreed on a stipulation of facts among which was the existence of
employer-employee relationship between the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An equally valid point is that petitioner's right to claim disability
compensation arose only from the time she was disabled to work and had to
retire prematurely by reason of her ailment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, the claim for compensation for total permanent disability
could be filed only after retirement from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But so long as petitioner's action had not
prescribed,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent Commission had jurisdiction to act on her claim even if at the time
of the filing thereof the employer-employee relationship had terminated, for
what vests jurisdiction is the fact that the illness which caused the
disability supervened and/or was aggravated in the course of her teaching
job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the employment was
coeval with the ailment, and with the two coexisting, an alleged absence of
employer-employee relationship at the time of the filing of the claim is
untenable as a defense.</p>

<blockquote>1. Anent the issue of compensability, the employer herein cannot
evade liability on the ground that "claimant's (herein petitioner)
ailments were degenerative in nature, and were caused by the aging
process." (p. 52, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>) Not having <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> this claim for compensation, the employer
suffers the legal consequences of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
"loss of non-jurisdictional defenses and ultimate admission of
compensability."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Moreover, the Workmen's Compensation Act which governs the
present situation expressly provides in its Section 44 that in the absence of
substantial evidence to the contrary it shall be presumed that a claim comes
within the provisions of this Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
this declaration of a benign sound public policy, an employee is freed from the
burden of proving that his illness or injury was caused or aggravated by the
nature of his work; all that is expected of him is to establish the
employer-employee relationship and the occurrence of the injury at the time
such relationship existed, after which the burden is shifted to the employer to
overthrow by substantial evidence the pre­sumed link between the injury and the
work of the employee.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, under the presumption of compensability established by the
law, the Court awarded compensation benefits to employees who in the ordinary
course of their employment suffered ailments of the heart, such as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a disease of the coronary artery whereby an
artery supplying blood to the muscular walls of the heart is blocked by a clot;<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
myocardial infarction,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
cardiac enlargement,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
coronary thrombosis, acute heart failure, or heart attack.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coronary arteriosclerosis is a condition characterized <span style="">by a </span>hardening and thickening of the
arteries which supply blood to the heart muscle.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
While We do not discount the possibility that such ailment may be "caused
by the aging process" as claimed by respondent employer, nonetheless that
fact alone will not be sufficient to remove the ailment from the periphery of
compensable disabling diseases under the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law applies to the young as well as to
the aged, and while advancing age may be a contributing factor to the
occurrence of an injury, the constant physical and mental exertions, strain,
and tension in teaching children of tender age <u>for a period of almost 37
years</u> are equally contributing and aggravating causes which render the
resulting disabling injury or ailment compensable under the law.</p>
