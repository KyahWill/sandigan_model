<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Leopoldo</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> R. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> and his wife received in 1952 cash dividends in 
the sum of P10.000.00 from <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> Brothers, Inc. 
The spouses did not declare said dividends in their joint income tax return for 
1952, but declared P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> thereof in their income 
tax return for 1953. On </span><st1:date month="8" day="14" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 14, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
they paid the tax due on their declared income for 1953.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">One year after or in August 1955 
agents of the Bureau of Internal Revenue re-examined the 1952 and 1953 joint 
income tax return of <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaido</span> and his wife and discovered the same. Whereupon, 
they readjusted the returns, increasing the declared income for 1952 by 
P10,000.00 and eliminating from the 1953 income tax return the reported 
dividends of P5,000.00. The- result was a deficiency income tax of P3,840.00 for 
1952 and an overpayment of tax in the amount of P1,600.00 for 
1953.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The examination report, dated 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="29" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 29, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
stated that it was a "mere adjustment of 1952 and 1953 returns", and recommended 
that the overpayment for 1953 in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> be credited against the deficiency tax for 1952. The 
Collector of Internal Revenue, however, by his letter dated </span><st1:date month="10" day="28" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 28, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
assessed against <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,840.00</span> 
as deficiency income tax for 1952, without crediting in his favor the 
overpayment in 1953.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Aguinaldo's</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> counsel in a letter dated 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="10" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 10, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
protested against the assessment, and requested that the overpayment for 1953 be 
credited in favor of the taxpayer. The request was denied and the taxpayer asked 
for reconsideration. Finally, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue informed him 
that the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> cannot be credited against 
the tax for 1952 inasmuch as the claim for tax credit was filed beyond the 
two-year period provided for in Section 309 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> died, but 
Andrea <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, his surviving spouse and <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals. After 
hearing, the Tax Court dismissed the appeal for "lack of cause of action." 
Petitioner thereupon elevated the case to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The single issue is whether or 
not petitioner is entitled to tax credit for the year 1953 pursuant to Section 
309 of the Tax Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner contends that Section 
309 does not require the filing of a claim within two years from the payment of 
the tax before tax credit could be given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the other hand, respondent 
Commissioner maintains that the authority of the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue under Section 309 can only be exercised if a claim for credit is made in 
writing and filed with him within two years from the payment of the tax. Section 
309 of the Tax Code states: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 
309.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="GramE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Authority of Collector to 
make compromises and to refund taxes</span></em>.‚Äù</span> The Collector of 
Internal Revenue may compromise any civil or other case arising under this Code 
or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, may 
credit or refund taxes erroneously or illegally received, or penalties imposed 
without authority, and may remit before payment any tax that appears to be 
unjustly assessed or excessive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"He shall refund the value of 
internal-revenue stamps when the same are returned in good condition by the 
purchaser, and may, in his discretion, redeem or exchange unused stamps that 
have been rendered unfit for use, and may refund their value upon proof of 
destruction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The authority of the Collector 
of Internal Revenue to credit or refund taxes or penalties under this section 
can only be exercised if the claim for credit or refund is made in writing and 
filed with him with two years after the payment of the tax or penalty." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The third paragraph of Section 
309, National Internal Revenue Code, afore-quoted, clearly requires the filing 
by the taxpayer of a written claim for credit or refund within two years after 
payment of the tax, before the Commissioner of Internal Revenue <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">can</span></em> exercise his authority to grant the 
credit or refund. Such requirement is therefore a condition precedent and 
non-compliance therewith precludes the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from 
exercising the authority <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> 
given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As noted, the <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldos</span> paid the income tax for 1953 on </span><st1:date month="8" day="14" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 14, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
<span class="SpellE">altho</span> the adjustment took place on </span><st1:date month="8" day="29" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 29, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
From both dates to </span><st1:date month="1" day="13" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 13, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
when the claim for tax credit was filed, more than two years have elapsed. 
Evidently, petitioner's claim for tax credit was filed beyond the period stated 
in Section 309.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the judgment appealed from is 
hereby affirmed, with costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IT IS SO 
ORDERED</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
