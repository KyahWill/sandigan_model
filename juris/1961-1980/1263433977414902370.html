might have been caused by sharp-pointed instruments, and the hacking wounds
Nos. 3, 5, 9, 14, 15, 16, 20, 23, 24 and 25 by a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that wounds Nos. 6, 7, 11 and 15

<span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>, who was armed with an "open
knife", stood as guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Bautista was holding a jungle bolo about 12 to 14
inches in length.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>" was armed with a "double-bladed
instrument" while "<span class="SpellE">Bansoy</span>" was holding
a revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> held <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> from behind by the neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> struggled and was about to extricate himself from
the hold of <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>, the latter clubbed him with the
butt of his gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> grabbed and held the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>was at this juncture that "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>" stabbed the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further declared that he saw Bautista hack
the victim twice with the jungle bolo although he was already lying <span style="">on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>" attempted to stab
him, he ran up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the room
on the second floor, he peeped thru the slit on the floor and saw that the four
men "helped one another" in attacking <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> After a while, upon noticing that the

prostrate on the ground, 18 meters from the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was gasping for breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together with the assistance of the
neighbors, they got a tricycle, which they used in their attempt to bring the
victim to the hospital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the way, however, they met appellant <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they saw <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>
running towards them with a gun, they became scared and fled to the railroad
tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, they saw <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> pull the victim from the tricycle and place him on
the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Normita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>,
24 years old, widow of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, declared that upon hearing her neighbor's shouts
for help she went out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing her
husband wounded lying inside a tricycle, she raised the body of her husband and
cradled him on her lap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
her, it was at that moment when appellant <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>
appeared and told her that her husband was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After saying this, <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>
removed the body of the victim from <span style="">the
tricycle and then stabbed the victim with a jungle bolo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pat. <span class="SpellE">Carmelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span>
testified that he investigated <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>, Bautista, <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>, de la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> and appellant
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> voluntarily executed written
statements admitting their complicity in the crime (Exhibits "F" and
"G"); that although <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> affirmed the veracity of his statement before the
Assistant City Fiscal (Exhibit "F") Rolando <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>
refused to do so after he was advised by his lawyer; that Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> refused to give any oral or written statements to
the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his statement before the
investigator (Exhibit "G"), <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>
admitted that he and his co-accused were members of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-Sigue</span>
Gang, while the victim, <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
was of the <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> Gang;
that he and his companions attacked <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> that night because of a previous physical
altercation between <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> and "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>" over a stolen bicycle.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Rolando <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>, while
admitting <span style="">his </span>presence at the
scene of the crime, denied any involvement therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of his defense is <span style="">that </span>it was <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> who was the aggressor, claiming that upon <span class="SpellE">Barredo's</span> arrival at the house of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Doray</span>, where he, Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>
<span style="">were watching television, <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> immediately mauled "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in retaliation of this attack that
"Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>" drew his knife and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> on the chest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> then ran out of the house </span>pursued
by "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not know anymore what happened because
he did not follow them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also declared
that he was arrested at <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00</st1:time> p. m. on
<st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1969</st1:date> by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span> but he claimed that he was told that he was being
apprehended for vagrancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed
that he never made the state­ments contained in Exhibit "G" and that
he signed the statement because he was maltreated by <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>
implicated him in the crime because he and <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>
had a fight over the loss of some vegetables in the market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted, however, that their quarrel was
settled by Capt. Hernando of the police in Precinct No. 3.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's claim of maltreatment was debunked by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Carmelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span> who explained
that they could not have maltreated the appellant in the investigation room
because during the investigation, the parents, wife and other relatives of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> were allowed to be present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further declared that he was not able to
get any written statement from Bautista or <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>
because the two invoked their constitutional rights and refused to answer their
questions.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied, on the basis of the evidence, that appellant <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> voluntarily executed Exhibit "G".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It discloses details about antecedent facts
which led to the incident of the 19th of September which only the perpetrators
of the crime could have known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
voluntary nature of the statement is further indicated by the presence of
mitigating assertions by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span>, however, from <span class="SpellE">Rebutar's</span>
extrajudicial confession (Exhibit "G"), the testimonies of the
eyewitnesses of the prosecution, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> and <span class="SpellE">Normita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, are by themselves sufficient to establish the
guilt of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the
trial court, <span class="SpellE">Liwanag's</span> testimony is credible as it
"was given in a very clear, spontaneous, natural and straight forward
manner which are the earmarks of truth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His gesture, inflection of voice and demeanor on the witness stand,
especially in the cross examination to which he has been exposed further
strengthened the credi­bility of his testimony." On matters of
credibility, this Court has accorded the highest degree of respect for the
findings of the trial judge because he had the opportunity to see, hear and
observe the witnesses testify and to weigh their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge's findings of fact shall not
be disturbed unless it appears from the record that facts or circumstances of
weight or influence were overlooked, their significance misinterpreted, or
there were inherent weaknesses in the supporting evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the situation here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> that the victim was stabbed and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
by appellant and his companions finds support from the nature, character and
direction of the wounds found on the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <i>post</i> <i style=""><span style="">mortem</span></i><span style=""> </span>findings indicated that the victim
sustained no less <span style="">than twenty-seven
(27) hacking wounds, stab wounds, incised wounds, abrasions and
contusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five of the wounds were
located on the back of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fatal wounds were located on the right and left side of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts confirm the declaration of <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> on the manner the assailants attacked the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant nevertheless contends that the prosecution was not able
to prove conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is fundamental
for conspiracy to exist that there must be unity of purpose and unity in the
execution of the unlawful objective.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the defendants by their acts aimed at the same object, one
performing one part and the other performing another part so as to complete it,
with a view to the attainment of the same object, and their acts, though
apparently independent were in fact concerted and cooperative, indicating
closeness of personal association, concerted action and concurrence of
sentiments, the Court will be justified in concluding that said defendants were
engaged in conspiracy.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Unlike evident premeditation, where a sufficient period of time must elapse to
afford full opportunity for meditation and for the perpetrator to deliberate on
the consequences of his intended deed, conspiracy arises on the very instant
the plotters agree, ex­pressly or impliedly, to commit the felony and forthwith
decide to pursue it.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, appellant Rolando <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> and his
companions, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Bautista, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> and "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>",
entered together the ground floor of the house of <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>
Gonzales de la Cruz in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, at 8:00 o'clock in the evening of September
19, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of them were armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As appellant ordered <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and his companions not to move, <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> stood guard armed with a pointed fan knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> then held <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> by the collar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> tried to extricate himself from <span class="SpellE">Rebutar's</span> hold, the latter hit him with the butt of his gun
while <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> also held him by the neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>" stabbed the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bautista hacked the victim with his jungle
bolo while he was already lying on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the witnesses, "Boy <span class="SpellE">Suman</span>",
<span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>, Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span>
helped one another <span style="">in assaulting </span>the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances sufficiently
show the evidence of conspiracy between appellants and his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the existence of conspiracy, the
claim of appellant <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> that he did not inflict
the fatal wound on the victim is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a conspirator, he is equally responsible for the acts of his
co-conspirators.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the record that the killing is qualified by
treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attack on the vic<span style="">tim </span>was not only sudden and
unexpected, but the fatal wounds appeared to have been inflicted when he was
held firmly by one of the accused and also after he fell on the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find tenable, however, the contention of counsel <i>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></i><span style=""> </span>Alice
V. <span class="SpellE">Pesigan</span> that evident premeditation has not been
proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no testimonial evidence as to how and when the assailants agreed to kill the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the extrajudicial
confession of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> (Exhibit
"G"), "<span class="SpellE">Juanky</span>" <span class="SpellE">Oding</span> picked him up on the afternoon of <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1969</st1:date> for the purpose of
looking for <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no <i>iota</i> of proof as to <i style="">when</i><span style=""> </span>the culprits agreed to kill the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a basis for determining whether
the accused had sufficient time, between inception of the plan and its
fulfillment, dispassionately to consider and accept its consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance of evident premeditation
must be established with equal certainty and clearness as the criminal act
itself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the judgment, insofar as it finds
appellant Rolando <span class="SpellE">Rebutar</span> y Gonzales guilty beyond
