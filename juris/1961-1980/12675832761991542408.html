<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal from the order 
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, in its Civil 
Case No. 669, fixing the amount of costs that was taxed against the 
respondent-appellant <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez. This appeal was 
originally brought to the Court of Appeals but because it involves only a 
question of law the Court of Appeals certified this case to this Court pursuant 
to the provision of Sections 17 and 31 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as 
amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellant <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez brought an action in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, in Civil Case No. 25918, against one <span class="SpellE">Paglinawan</span>, and having obtained a judgment in his favor 
Gomez secured a writ of execution. The property that was levied on execution was 
an Oldsmobile car which was the subject of a chattel mortgage executed by <span class="SpellE">Paglinawan</span> in favor of Gomez, but the chattel mortgage was 
not registered with the Motor Vehicles Office. The automobile that was the 
subject of the chattel mortgage was found in the possession of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Stephen w Martin in the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>. When the Sheriff of the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> seized the automobile pursuant to the w of execution 
issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin filed a third-party claim with said Sheriff, 
claiming that he was the owner of said automobile. In view of the third-party 
claim of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin the appellant Gomez filed a 
bond of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in order that the Sheriff could 
proceed with the auction sale of the automobile. After appellant Gomez had filed 
the bond and the Sheriff thereby continued to be in possession of the automobile 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin filed an action in the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> to establish his rights as owner of 
the automobile and in his complaint he prayed for the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction against the Sheriff of Bagnio to enjoin him from 
proceeding with the auction sale of the automobile. The complaint of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin was docketed as Civil Case No. 660, and it 
is the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> on appeal. The Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> issued the writ of preliminary 
injunction prayed for, and so the Sheriff desisted from proceeding with the 
execution sale of the automobile. However, the sheriff continued to have the 
custody of the automobile pursuant to the writ of execution issued by the Court 
of First Instance of Manila. Being the custodian of the automobile during the 
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. 669 before the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, the Sheriff caused the 
automobile to be stored in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, obligating himself 
thereby to pay for the storage fees of the automobile while the same was under 
his custody.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, after trial, rendered judgment declaring the 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin the lawful owner of the car, it having 
been established that Martin bought the car in good faith, not knowing that the 
car had been the subject of a chattel mortgage, and it was also established that 
the supposed chattel mortgage on the car was not registered with the Motor 
Vehicles Office. In 'ho derision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> it categorically stated that the appellant Gomez 
should y the storage fees of the automobile as part of the 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Celestino</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Gomez appealed to the Court of 
Appeals from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While the appeal was pending in 
the Court of Appeals <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin filed a motion 
in. the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> for the 
immediate execution of the judgment, thereby praying for the delivery of the 
possession of the automobile to him. The Court of First Instance of Bagnio 
granted the motion for immediate execution but imposed the condition that "the 
petitioner (in order to have the car returned) is hereby required to file a bond 
in favor of respondents in the amount of P4,000.00 out of which sum the sum of 
P1,000.00 shall answer for the storage fees, with the condition that in case the 
petitioner shall be adjudged by the appellate court not to be the owner of the 
car in question and/or the judgment is reversed totally or partially, the 
petitioner shall pay respondents the value of .the said car in the amount of 
P4,000.00 which included the storage fees." <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> 
Martin did not file the bond as required by the court, and so the car remained 
in the custody of the Sheriff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court of Appeals, in its 
decision promulgated on October 14, 1959, affirmed the decision of the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> in Civil Case No. 669 and, 
among others, it declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We hereby pronounce 
petitioner as the true and lawful owner of the car in question; declare the levy 
on November 29, 1956, and any further proceedings to sell the car or turn it 
over to responded Gomez as null and void, thus restraining and enjoining the 
respondent sheriff, his deputies, agents, or representatives from further 
depriving the petitioner of his possession, much loss ownership of said car, 
with costs against the respondent-appellant 
Gomez."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision of the Court of 
Appeals became final <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on November 6, 1959, 
and on December 8, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin filed a motion for 
execution the said judgment. The motion for execution was accompanied by a "Bill 
of Costs" which contained the following items:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The total amount of the amended 
I»ill of Costs was P3<span class="GramE">,067.85</span>, or an increase over the 
original Bill of Costs in the sum of P3,003.50 representing the storage fees of 
the car while the same was in the custody of the Sheriff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In order to give the appellant 
<span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez a chance to present evidence to show 
that the storage fees that wore included in the amended Bill of Costs were <span class="SpellE">exhorbitant</span> the lower court set a hearing on the said 
amended bill of costs. The parties had agreed to reduce the amount of storage 
fees in favor of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rillo</span> at the rate of P3.00 per 
day and in favor of Mr. L. <span class="SpellE">Esquejo</span> at the rate of 
PI.60 per day. September 15, 1960 the lower court fixed the storage in an order, 
which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Respondent <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez objects to the storage fees as part the 
costs on the ground that the same am net justified by the Rules of Court. 
Sheriff's fees and custodian's fee are part of the costs (<span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, 
67, Phil. 658). The decision of this court charging storage fees as costs 
against <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez was completely affirmed by the 
Court of Appeals and that the decision in now final. The parties have agreed to 
reduce the amount of storage fees in favor of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rillo</span> at the rate of P3.00 per day and <span class="SpellE">Esquejo</span> at the rate of P1.50 per day. The car was stored in 
the garage of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rillo</span> 117 days or a total of P351.00 
and 993 days with <span class="SpellE">Esquejo</span> or a total of P1<span class="GramE">,489.50</span>. Total storage fees are, therefore, fixed at P1<span class="GramE">,840.50</span> which must be paid by <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez. Once final this taxation of costs may be 
collected by writ of execution."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellant Gomez filed a 
motion for reconsideration of the order of the court fixing the storage fees at 
P1<span class="GramE">,840.50</span> and including said amount as part of the 
costs that should be paid by him. Upon the denial of his motion for 
reconsideration said appellant filed a second motion for reconsideration which 
was also denied. Hence, this appeal by said appellant from that order of the 
lower court declaring the storage fees as part of the costs and fixing the 
amount of storage fees at P1,840.50.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this appeal appellant Gomez 
contends that the lower court erred in including storage foes as costs, because 
the same is not included in the enumeration of costs under Sections 10 and 11, 
Rule 131 of the Rules of Court. (The incidents in the present case took place 
before the promulgation of the Revised Rules of Court. Rule 131 of the old Rules 
of Court is now Rule 142 of the Revised Rules of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection let it be 
noted that in the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, declaring <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin 
the lawful owner of the automobile question and ordering its return to him, it 
is stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"However, the storage fees of the 
car must be charged <span class="GramE">an against</span> the respondent <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the 
above-mentioned decision of the trial court appealed to the Court of Appeals 
(CA-G.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> R. No. 
22190) the question of the propriety or legality of the inclusion storage fees 
as part of the costs was not raised by hint Gomez. This part of the decision 
should have questioned in that (first) appeal. The Court of affirmed the 
decision of the trial court "with costs against the respondent-appellant Gomez." 
It may be considered, therefore, that the Court of Appeals had also affirmed 
that part of the decision of the trial court taxing storage fees as part of the 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Be that as it may, We are of the 
opinion that the trial court acted correctly in taxing as costs the storage fees 
of the automobile in question while the same was under the custody of the 
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>. Let it he noted that the Sheriff of 
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> was in custody of the automobile pursuant to 
the writ of execution issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil 
Case No. 25918. By all means, under the circumstances, the Sheriff is entitled 
to collect fees: (1) "for executing process . . .", and (2) "for serving an 
attachment against the .property of the defendants ... together with a 
reasonable allowance to be made by the court for expenses, if any, necessarily 
incurred in caring for property attached (Section 7, paragraphs (a) and (b), 
Rule 130 of the old Rules of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the present case the Sheriff 
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> attached, or levied on, the automobile in 
question, took custody of it, and while in custody he caused the same to be 
stored in a garage. The lower court had found that the reasonable fees for the 
storage of the car for a period of 1,110 days was P1<span class="GramE">,840.50</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It may be argued that the Sheriff 
of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> attached the automobile in question and took 
custody of it pursuant to the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila in 
Civil Case No. 25918 and not in connection with Civil Case No. 669 of the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> which is now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> on appeal. It must be remembered, however, that Civil Case 
No. 669 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> is 
connected with, or is an offshoot of, Civil Case No. 25918 of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila. It was because the automobile in question was levied on 
execution pursuant to the writ of execution issued by the Court of First 
Instance of Manila that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin had to 
file a third-party claim and later a complaint in Civil Case No. 669 before the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> to assert his right 
as owner and possessor of the said automobile. When <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin filed his third- party claim the Sheriff 
could have left that automobile in the possession of said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> but appellant Gomez filed a bond in order that the 
execution proceedings might continue and so the Sheriff continued to have the 
automobile under his custody. In other words, it was the appellant Gomez who was 
responsible for the car being held by the Sheriff, and if for no other reason 
but on the ground of equity he should be made to pay for the storage fees of the 
automobile while the same was in the custody of the Sheriff from the time that 
it was seized until the day when it was returned to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin. The lower court presumably must have this 
circumstance in mind when in its decision it stated that "the storage fees of 
the car must be charged as costs against the respondent <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> Gomez."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Did the trial court correctly 
include this storage fees as part of the costs. We believe 
so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The taxation of storage fees as 
costs is authorized under paragraph (g), Section 10, of Rule 131 of the old 
Rules of Court, which provides that the prevailing party in the Court of First 
'Instance may recover as costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(g) The lawful fees paid by him 
for service of any process in action. . ."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above-quoted provision of 
paragraph (g), Section 10, of Rule 131 of the Old Rules of Court is a 
reproduction of a similar provision in Section 492 of Act 190 (old Code of Civil 
Procedure). A similar provision appeared in Section 491 of Act 190 regarding 
costs in the Justice of the Peace Courts. <span class="GramE">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., <span class="SpellE">lnc</span>.</span>

whereby a court compels a compliance with its demands.' (50 C<span class="GramE">. 
.J., 411.)</span> <span class="GramE">(Italics ours.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Within the aforesaid definition 
fall, in our opinion, all the proceedings for the execution of the order of 
attachment, with respect to personal properly, from the time the sheriff 
attaches and takes possession of the attached properties by virtue of the order 
of the court and conserves and places the same under his custody until the 
attachment is lifted or the property is gold at public auction upon a judgment 
or order of the same court which issued the attachment. The sheriff’s or 
custodian's fees for his services from and during the attachment are 
consequently a part of the costs, mid the plaintiff is entitled to recover the 
same."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As we have adverted to, under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 7 of Rule 130 of the old Rules of Court the 
sheriffs are entitled to collect fees for executing process, and for serving an 
attachment against the property of the defendant together with a reasonable 
allowance for expenses necessarily incurred in caring for property attached. In 
the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> it is undeniable that the 
storage fees constitute reasonable expenses necessarily incurred in caring for 
the automobile that was levied on execution and held by the Sheriff. The act of 
the Sheriff in having under his custody the automobile in question is "service 
of any Process in action" as construed by this Court in the <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> case, and for this "service" he is entitled to be 
paid the fees as provided by law. The fees of the Sheriff in having under his 
custody a property that is attached or levied on execution includes reasonable 
expenses in caring for the property. And so in the present case the Sheriff of 
Bagnio is entitled to the sheriff's fees which, as we have said, include 
reasonable expenses in caring for the automobile in question and this sheriff's 
fee is included in the lawful fees contemplated in paragraph (g), Sec. 10, Rule 
131 of the old Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant Gomez also contends 
that even granting that the storage fees may be taxable as costs, he should not 
be made to pay the storage fees from the time that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin filed the complaint in Civil Case No. 669 
and after his petition for execution was granted. This contention is without 
merit. The Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> continued to hold 
possession of the automobile in question after <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin had filed his third-party claim because 
appellant Gomez filed a bond so the Sheriff could proceed with the proceedings 
on the execution of the judgment. <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> Martin had 
to file an action and ask for a writ of preliminary injunction in order that the 
Sheriff could not proceed with the execution sale. When the Sheriff was enjoined 
from proceeding with the execution sale he continued having custody of the 
automobile. Appellant Gomez should have taken steps so the Sheriff would release 
the automobile, but this he did not do. It is true that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin asked for immediate execution of the 
judgment in Civil Case No. 669 after the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> rendered judgment in his favor. But the order of the 
court granting the petition for execution imposed the condition that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin should file a bond of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> did not 
file the required bond. So the execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. 669 
was not carried out, and the Sheriff continued to have custody of the car until 
the delivery of said car to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Martin after the 
Court of Appeals had finally decided that the car should he returned to said 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. Appellant Gomez was responsible for the 
Sheriff's having taken possession of the automobile and holding it during the 
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. 669, so he must answer for 
all the expenses incurred in the storage of the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We hold, therefore, that the 
lower court did not err m including the storage fees of the car as part of the 
costs of the suit in the present case, and in fixing the amount of said storage 
fees at P1,840.50.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">In 
view of the foregoing</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the order appealed from is 
affirmed, with costs against appellant <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> 
Gomez.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
