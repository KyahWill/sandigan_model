				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for certiorari and mandamus with prayer for
preliminary injunction, petitioner seeks (1) to overturn re­spondent judge's
order of September 5, 1968 declaring the case submitted for decision and those
of September 13 and October 21, 1968 denying petitioner's motion to adduce
additional evidence, (2) to compel said respondent judge to allow presentation
of such evidence, and (3) to restrain him from proceeding with the promul­gation
of the judgment all in Criminal Case 86565 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, entitled "People of the Philippines, Plaintiff, versus Jesus W. <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span>, Accused."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1968</st1:date>,
this Court, without requiring answer, dismissed the petition for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1969</st1:date>,
petitioner moved to reconsider our order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereto attached were certain documents -
Annexes A, B, C, D and E - calculated to bring home petitioner's point that the
transaction between him and the offended party, the subject of the <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> charge below, was one of loan.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1969</st1:date>,
this Court directed respondents to comment on the motion for

set for hearing on oral arguments for <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="3">March
 17, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only counsel for
petitioner appeared thereat.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing petitioner's counsel, we issued, on <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1969</st1:date>, a temporary

<p class="BODY">The controlling facts are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila
in the case heretofore adverted to, with the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>,

who was stranded in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> <u>or</u> of <u>returning</u>

accused, once in possession of the aforesaid check in the sum of P10,000.00 far
from complying with his obligation cashed it and refused to return the said
amount, despite repeated demands made upon him to do so and with intent to
defraud, misappropriated, misapplied and converted the same or the value
thereof to his own personal use and benefit to the damage and prejudice of the
said <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Iturralde</span> in the said sum of P10,000.00, Philippine

<p class="NUM">1. Postponements and adjournments are matters addressed to the
discretion of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
question of whether or not respondent judge gravely abused his discretion, we
now address ourselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner (defendant) was arraigned on July
27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial on August 11 was
transferred to August 17 due to the absence of the return to the subpoena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the last named date, petitioner failed to
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the order of arrest and
the confiscation of the bond was set aside on defendant's explanation that he
had no time to come to Manila as he was then in <span class="SpellE">Cabagan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial for <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1967</st1:date>
was postponed on the defense motion grounded upon the averment that petitioner
was exploring the possibility of an amicable settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing for October 10 was again
postponed by agreement of the parties for the same purpose of amicably settling
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So was the hearing of October
31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the hearing for December 1 did
not take place because defendant was ill. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>For the same reason, the hearing set for
December 28 was transferred to <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="1">January
 15, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the hearing
had to be reset for <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1968</st1:date>
for lack of proof of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
finally commenced on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aforesaid, the defense had already started
presenting the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two days were set for the next hearing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>September 5 and 6, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on September 5, defense
counsel moved for continuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
averred that he was not able to contact his wit­nesses because he did not have
"official notice" of the hearing for that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact, however, was that counsel "had
personal knowledge thereof as early as last Monday." Counsel then
manifested that he wanted to present petitioner's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge, con­sidering the testimony
of complainant and the branch manager of the Bank of Commerce that defendant's
wife was not present at the transaction, took defendant's oral motion for
postponement on February 5, 1968 "as another dilatory move to which the
private prosecutor objected." Respondent judge reasoned out that if the
purpose of defendant was not to delay he could have easily brought to court
that day defendant's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In refusing
postponement, the court felt that it had given to defendant all the opportunity
to settle the matter with the complainant or to present his evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the factual backdrop presented, it is quite obvious that the
lower court kept itself within bounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if we are solely to go by the facts to this point recited, it would
seem that re­spondent judge's orders cannot be tagged as infected by fatal
irregularities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor will the motion to adduce additional evidence filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1968</st1:date> help petitioner
any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion was planted upon the
ground that the evidence the defense desired to adduce "shall consist of
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span>
and docu­mentary evidence which will prove that the subject matter of this case
was that of a loan and that it was <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span> who transacted" this matter with
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner charges that
respondent judge acted with haste when on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1968</st1:date>, the motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the motion was set for hearing
is not, of course, determinative of the question as to whether or not the
motion is <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> such that the trial court may act thereon
without waiting for the date of hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Really, the motion to adduce additional evidence is <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere allegation that the additional
evidence would consist in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span>
J. <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span> and documentary evidence lacks
specificity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Explanation as to why the
transaction is a loan is wanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
precise facts to be proven are not known.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bare statement that the case refers to a "loan" is notches
below the level of an aver­ment of facts it is nothing but a conclusion of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It relegates the motion to one
which is <u>pro</u> <u>forma.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1968</st1:date> fares no better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, petitioner's cry of injustice is
that he is in grave jeopardy of being convicted, in infringement of his
constitutionally protected right to be heard upon Section 1(17), Article III of
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument
obviously lacks merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without giving to
the lower court as much as a hint as to what the evidence to be presented would
actually consist of, re­spondent judge was right in likewise throwing out this
motion.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. We take stock, however, of the averments in the motion - <u>filed</u>
<u>before</u> <u>this</u> <u>Court</u> on January 2, 1968 - to reconsider this
Court's minute resolution of December 11, 1968 dismissing the herein petition
for certiorari and mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time,
petitioner's new counsel, who for the first time appeared in the court below
when they filed the motion to adduce additional evidence, attached for
consideration of this Court the documents, Annexes A, B, C, D and E, heretofore
mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the words of counsel, they
did so "to avoid the impression that his motion for postpone­ment
[evidently referring to the verbal motion below of <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1968</st1:date>] was merely intended for delay."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These documents are quite revealing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worthwhile it is to underscore the salient
portions thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Annex</u> <u>A</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">These letters belatedly presented and only to this Court, forces
upon us a choice of two courses to pursue:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Are we to hold fast to the rule that certiorari will not lie upon the
ground of abuse of discretion unless there be "such capricious and
whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction"?<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Or, are we to bend procedural requirements and consider as an overriding
consideration the fact that the documents before us could, after all, prove
that petitioner is not guilty of the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>
charged? As we look in retrospect at the proceedings in the court below, it
would seem to us that the obsession of petitioner's former counsel was to gain
time to the end that the case be settled amicably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, he did not make as much as a
perfunctory effort to look into the defense his client, the petitioner, might
have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not hesitate to say that,
being a member of the Bar, he could have known that there was an arguably
presentable case on behalf of his client considering the documents just
adverted to Because, a loan transaction is not <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have even cross-examined complainant
on those documents, or presented defendant's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would not have even dilly-dallied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he could have faced the issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This incompetence of counsel is "so
great that his client is prejudiced and prevented from fairly presenting his
case"- a ground for reopening.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to adduce additional evidence could not have advanced
petitioner's cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because,
the new attorneys who presented this motion have not appended thereto the
documents heretofore mentioned.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is no excuse that the judge did not wait for September 27, the date
petitioner set for the hearing a that motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not worth considering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor
did counsel attach those documents to their later motion for reconsideration of
<st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If petitioner did not succeed in the court below, he cannot lay
the blame at the door of respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not enter­tain the least doubt that had those letters been shown
to respondent judge, the latter would have lent a willing ear to petitioner's
plea for further opportunity to offer them, to identify them, and to present
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely enough, respondent judge
would not look at those documents with hostile eyes; instead, he would consider
them with the other evidence of record in finally determining the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are confident that respondent judge knows
that if these documents were presented below and reopening is denied, he would
be open to a charge of grave abuse of discretion,</p>

<p class="BODY">We have before us the vehement insistence of counsel that with
the testimony of defendant's wife and those letters, defendant could overcome
the evidence against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now that these
documents came to light, we take the hospitable view that defendant should be
given another opportunity to offer them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A man's liberty is precious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should not be taken away except for the most cogent of reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have once Said - in a civil case - that
technicality should be turned out of a case especially "in the face of
over­whelming proof that the main decision was not according to conscience,
equity and justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

So wide is the discretion of the court that authority <span class="GramE">is not
wanting</span> to show that certiorari is "more discretionary than either
pro­hibition or mandamus."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In the exercise of our superintending control over inferior courts, we are to
be guided by all the circum­stances of each particular case "<u>as</u> <u>the</u>
<u>ends</u> <u>of</u> <u>justice</u> <u>may</u> <u>require</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
So it <span class="GramE">is,</span> that the writ will be granted where
necessary to prevent a substantial wrong or to do substantial justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, there <span class="GramE">are</span> what may be termed
exceptional facts, which call for appropriate remedy:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the documents which tend to prove that the
transaction is a loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is better, on
balance, that we look beyond procedural requirements and overcome the ordinary
reluctance to exercise our supervisory powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this, to the end that the orders issued below may be controlled
"<u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>them</u> <u>conformable</u> <u>to</u> <u>law</u>
<u>and</u> <u>justice</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, two principles here meet and clash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certiorari lies only where there is a grave
abuse of discretion, because clearly the court below had jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there is petitioner's
right to acquittal if guilt is not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than this is that the evidence sought to
be presented - before judgment is rendered - could spell the difference between
acquittal and a jail term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One principle
has roots as deep as the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is
against the accused; the other favors him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We opt for giving the accused a chance to exculpate <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this, we have in mind the constitutional
precept that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed to be
innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by
himself and counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Instance of Manila to reopen Criminal Case No. 86565, entitled "People of
