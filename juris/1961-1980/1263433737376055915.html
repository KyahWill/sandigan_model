				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a verified petition filed with this Court on January 31, 1970,
Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>,
Jr. alleged that the respondent, Nestor M. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>,
is a member of the Philippine Bar and before his appointment as Provincial
Fiscal of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, was a practicing
attorney; that sometime in 1968, <span style="">Jose </span>B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
engaged the services of respondent as private prosecutor in Criminal Case No.
88333 for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> entitled "People of the Philippines
versus Juan B. Bañez, Jr. and Amelita Joaquin" of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch XVIII, presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>, Jr.; that the parties, with the conformity
and consent of the Court, agreed to settle the case amicably with Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr. and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Amelita</span>
Joaquin, undertaking to pay Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> the amount
of the loan involved in the case plus interest; that pursuant to said
agreement, Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr. paid Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, through the latter's attorney, respondent Nestor M. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>, the amount of P10,000.00 covered by three (3)
checks, receipt of which was duly acknowledged by the respondent; that aside
from the amount covered by the checks, during the period from December 4, 1968
to March 24, 1969, inclusive, the respondent, directly and/or through a
representative, obtained from Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr. and
his wife various amounts with a total of P4,050.00 on the assurance of the
respondent that he was going to pay the said <span style="">amount to his client, Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>; that all
the aforesaid amounts were never received by Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>;
that the checks covering the amount of P10,000.00 were cashed by the respondent
himself or through his representative, and together with the other amounts
which the respondent received in cash from Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>,
Jr. and his wife were all misappropriated by said respondent for his own use
and benefit; that despite repeated demands by Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
and Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr., the respondent refused to
deliver the aforesaid amounts to Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>; that
as a consequence of respondent's refusal to deliver the aforesaid amounts to
Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, the respondent was charged with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> before the City Fiscal of Manila, docketed as I.S.
No. 69-21152; and that the respondent's act in unjustly </span><span style="">retaining </span><span style="">money due his client constitutes gross misconduct which is a sufficient
ground for removal or </span><span style="">suspension
</span><span style="">from his office as an attorney.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court required the respondent to file an answer to the
complaint within ten (10) days from notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer dated March 12, 1970, the respondent admits having
received the amount of P10,000.00 but not the other amounts mentioned in the
petition, and avers, as special defenses, that while the criminal case of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr.
and his wife was pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila, <span style="">involving </span>the sum of P27,000.00, the
parties agreed to settle the case amicably by the accused paying the entire
amount due plus interest and other expenses; that as a result of this
agreement, Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr. started paying Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, through the respondent, the sum of P10,000.00; that
the additional sum of P4,050.00 was the subject discussed in the preliminary
investigation wherein the respondent agreed to return the sum of P10,000.00;
that this administrative charge filed against the respondent was only the
result of misunderstanding as the respondent accepted in good faith the amount
of P10,000.00 for which he issued the corresponding receipt; and that
notwithstanding the fact that the respondent rendered legal services to Jose B.
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, the respondent is willing to return the amount
of P10,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court referred on <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="4">April

<p class="BODY">In the report and recommendation submitted by the Solicitor
General on <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1979</st1:date>,
the following facts were stated:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that respondent was the lawyer of Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in two (2) cases to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a) <span class="GramE">an</span> administrative case involving a
parcel of land in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>

vs. Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Amelita</span>
S. Joaquin', for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in the amount of P27,200.00
and wherein Jose E. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> was the complainant.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before the criminal case could be terminated, the complainant
therein Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> (now one of the petitioners
herein), and the accused therein Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr.
(also a petitioner herein), and his spouse, agreed to settle the case amicably
(par. 5 petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the
agreement, <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span> started paying <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>,
thru respondent herein, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> under
Treasurer's Check No. T-44105 of the Manufacturers Bank &amp; Trust Co. dated <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1968</st1:date>;</blockquote>

Bank Check No. 1230807 dated <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1968</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The said payments were properly receipted and were made with the
knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The criminal case against the <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>
spouses could not, however, be dismissed since the balance of P17<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> remained unpaid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, the respondent held on to the amount pending settlement of
his attorney's fees in the administrative case adverted to above as well as in
the criminal case against the <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span> spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">That was the situation when the respondent was appointed on <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1969</st1:date> as Provincial Fiscal of
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By reason of his said appointment, the respondent withdrew as private
prosecutor in the criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
at that juncture that the respondent had a misunderstanding with his then
client, Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, anent the amount of attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
even went to the extent of denying having given authority to respondent in the
collection <span style="">of the various amounts from
the <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span> spouses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent, who was then attending to his duties as Provincial
Fiscal of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, decided to return the
amount to Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr. who, however, claimed
that aside from the amounts covered by receipts, he had also given respondent
and the latter's representative on different dates, cash <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P4,050.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As respondent vehemently
denied having received the latter amount, <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span> filed
with the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office of Manila a complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against the herein respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at this time when the petition for
disbarment was filed with this Honorable Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">An information</span> for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
was subsequently filed against the respondent in the Court of First Instance of
Manila (Criminal Case No. 1563).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1971</st1:date>, however, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span> executed an affidavit of desistance (Annex 'A' Motion
to Dismiss) which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>'JUAN <span style="">B. BAÑEZ, </span>JR.
and ANGELITA S. JOAQUIN, spouses, of legal age, and with residence at No. 54 <span class="SpellE">Capalad</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Balangkas</span>,
Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, being first duly sworn, under
oath, jointly depose and state:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That they are the complaining witness in
Criminal Case No. 1563 entitled 'People of the Philippines vs. Nestor M. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>' of the Court of First Instance of Manila, which is
now the subject of re-investigation by the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office of Manila upon petition of the accused;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span> said case which is for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> arose out of the delivery of the sum of P14,050.00
by complainants Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Amelita</span> S. Joaquin to accused Nestor M. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
for him to deliver to his client, Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, in
connection with the settlement of a certain criminal case (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.

in which herein complainants and said Mr. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> were
parties;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
acknowledged having received the aforementioned amount of P14,050.00, even
signing receipts <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, but kept the amount
because he was waiting for complainants to complete the total sum of their
obliga­tion before turning the same to his client, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That due to misunderstanding and lack of
communication between complainants, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>, who had, in the meantime, withdrawn as
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Peña's</span> counsel due to his appointment as
provincial fiscal of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, herein
complainants entertained the thought that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
<span style="color: windowtext;">absconded</span> with or retained the money
entrusted to him for delivery to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, which led
to the filing of the present cri­minal case in the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office of Manila, against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That when this case was pending preliminary
investigation in the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office, accused
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>, being then the provincial fiscal of
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> and saddled with the duties of his
position there, was not always present at the investigation, so much so that he
had not the full opportunity to amplify his defense and because of his repeated
failures to attend the preliminary investigations, the Investigating Fiscal, on
June 4, 1970, filed the aforesaid Criminal case in the Court of First Instance
of Manila;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on June 11, 1970, accused Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> returned to herein complainants the amount of
P14,050.00, which they themselves delivered to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
in full settlement of their obligation thereby resulting in the dismissal by
the Court of First Instance of the criminal case (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. 88333), on the very same day;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the accused had explained his side of the
matter, which explanation the herein complainants found reasonable and
satisfactory, and that complainants, after a careful deliberation on all the
facts and circum<span style="">stances surrounding the
case, were fully convinced that accused Atty. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>
had no intention whatsoever to defraud them or to abscond or retain the money
for his own use and benefit;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in view of all the foregoing, herein
complaining wit<span style=""> </span>are no longer interested in, and have decided to desist from,
further prosecuting Criminal Case No. 1563 against accused Nestor M. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>, or further appearing or testifying before any
investigating body, court or administrative body, in any case having to do with
the matter that gave rise to the filing of the present criminal case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, in the interest of fairness and to
prevent a miscarriage of justice, complainants herein respectfully request that
the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office of Manila recommend or take
such steps that would lead to the prompt dismissal of Criminal Case No. 1563.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, deponents Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>,
Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Amelita</span> S. Joaquin have set their signatures <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> this 29th day of July, 1971, at the City of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the different hearings
of the disbarment case scheduled by the Office of the Solicitor General, complainants
did not appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the
Solicitor General made the following recommendation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing, it is clear that the petitioners are no
longer interested in prosecuting this Administrative case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No clear and positive step was ever taken by
petitioners to prove or substantiate the charges in their petition for
respondent's disbarment or suspension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, respondent has shown dogged determination in
defending himself as shown by his presence in all the proceedings taken before
the Office of the Solicitor General wherein he adduced competent documentary
evidence marked as Exhibits '1', '2' and '3' which in effect exonerates him
from the charge of 'unjustly retaining money due his client and/or
misappropriating for his own use and benefit money of his client'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court has set the guideline for the quantum of evidence
that is necessary to justify the imposition of a penalty against a member of
the Bar in a disbarment case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in
Lim vs. Antonio, Administrative Case No. 848, September 39, 1971, 41 SCRA, <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="9">Sept. 30, 1971</st1:date>, <span style="">p. </span>44, this Honorable Court ruled, as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Considering the serious consequences of the disbarment or
suspension of a member of the Bar, We have consistently held that clearly
preponderant evidence is necessary to justify <span style="">the imposition of either penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More so in the instant case where it has been clearly established that
complainant's motives are not beyond suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence of record shows that the respondent was instrumental in the
filing of Criminal Cases Nos. 3681 and 91293, the first for perjury filed in
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
and the second for falsification of a public and/or official document filed in
the Court of First Instance of Manila, against said complainant.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>In a subsequent case, (<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Gellada</span>, Administrative Case No. 767, December 20, 1971, 42
SCRA, December 20, 1971, p. 549) this Honorable Court held that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It is a well-settled rule that in disbarment proceedings, the
burden of proof rests upon the complainant and for the Court to exercise its
disciplinary powers, the case against the respondent must be established by
convincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as held in one
case, the power to disbar attorneys ought always to be exercised with great
caution, and should follow only where there is a clear preponderance of
evidence against the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
presumption is - an attorney is innocent of the charges prepared and has
performed his duty as an officer of the court in accordance with his oath.'</p>

<blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING consideration, it is respectfully
recommended that the instant petition for disbarment against res­pondent Nestor
M. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span> be dismissed.</blockquote>
