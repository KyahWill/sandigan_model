				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The plaintiff, doing <span style="">business
</span>under the name "East <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Lumber
Mills," was the owner of a timber concession and sawmill located at
Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1950" day="8" month="11">November
 <span style="">8, </span>1950</st1:date> the
defendant Woodcraft Works, Ltd., entered into an agree­ment with the plaintiff
to purchase from the latter 300,000 board feet of Philippine round logs at
P60.00 per thousand board feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to
bad weather conditions and the failure of the defendant to send the necessary
vessels to Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
only 13,068 hoard feet of logs were delivered.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1951" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1951</st1:date>
the parties entered into a new contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The previous one was cancelled, with the plain­tiff waiving all his
claims <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certain advances which had been given by the defendant to the plaintiff,
in the aggregate amount of P9<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, were transferred
to and considered as advances on the new contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was stipulated that the defendant would
purchase from the plaintiff 1,700,000 board feet of logs of the specifica­tions
stated in the contract - 1,300,000 board feet at P78.00 per thousand and the
rest at P70.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also agreed that
the shipment was to be "before the end of July, but will not commence
earlier than April with the option to make partial shipment depending on the
availabi­lity of logs and vessels."</p>

<p class="BODY">Of the quantity of logs agreed upon, only two shipments were
made, one in March and the other in April, 1951, amounting to 333,832 board
feet and 128,825 board feet, respectively, or a total of 462,657 board
feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1951" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1951</st1:date> the plaintiff filed in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> an action for rescission of
the contract of <st1:date year="1951" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1951</st1:date>
and for recovery of damages in the sum of P155<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
by reason of the defendant's failure to com­ply with its obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant filed an answer and later an
amended answer, denying the material allega­tions of the complaint, with
special defenses and counter­claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial the lower court rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE and on the strength of all the foregoing, the Court
renders judgment:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>declaring the
aforementioned contract of January 22, 1951, rescinded; ordering the defendant
to pay to the plaintiff for actual damages suffered by the latter in the amount
of P145<span class="GramE">,623.03</span>, plus the amount of P50,000.00
represent­ing the plaintiff's actual loss of credit in the operation of his
business, and, another sum of P5,000.00 as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant is likewise ordered to pay the
costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant appealed to this Court and now avers that the lower
court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(1) in stating that
Woodcraft Works, ltd. was obligated to send the boat to receive the shipment of
logs of the East <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Lumber Mills at Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, before the end of July 1951; (2) in deciding that (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) had sufficient stock of logs to cover the con­tract
on July 31, 1951; (3) in stating that appellant failed to comply with the terms
and conditions of the contract; (4) <span style="">in </span>granting
damages to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>; and (5) in not granting damages
and recovery of money in favor of <span style="">herein
appellant."<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main issue before us </span>is
whether or not appellant Woodcraft Works, Ltd. failed to comply with its
obligations <span style="">under </span>the contract,
or more specifically, whether or not it was obligated to furnish the vessel to <span style="">receive the shipment </span>of logs from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
contends that it was not.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
A) <span class="GramE">does</span> not expressly provide as to which of the
parties should furnish the <span style="">vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>But it does contain provisions which
show clearly, albeit only by implication, that the obligation to do so devolved
upon appellant, thus:</p>

<blockquote><u>Fees
&amp; </u><u><span style="">Charges</span></u><span style="">:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""> </span></span>Bureau of Forestry inspection charges
and Philippine Govern­ment <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fees are for ac­count
of Woodcraft Works, Ltd.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Dispatch of Ship</u>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately upon arrival of the vessel at
Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, you will
commence loading at the rate of 200,000 <span class="SpellE">bdft</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="">per</span></span><span style=""> </span>working day per four hatches.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should the weather <span style="">be unfavorable, be </span>sure to have a
certificate signed <span style="">by the </span>captain
confirming time idle due to this fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, <span style="">in </span>the event
the ship's <span style="">gears are </span>not
functioning well, kindly do <span style="">likewise
and </span>get a statement from the captain.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Demurrage</u>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failure to load 200,000 <span class="SpellE">bdft</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="">per</span></span><span style=""> working day,
you </span><span style="">agree to </span>pay us the
sum of P800.00 per day pro-rata.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The contract was in the form of a letter addressed by appellant
to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and the <span style="">terms set forth </span><span style="">in the
portions </span><span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>, particularly with
respect to <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues, demurrage and condition of
the weather and of the ship's machinery, would have been of little concern to
appellant and would not have been imposed by it if <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
were the one to furnish the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties, which
under the law may be taken into consideration to determine their inten­tion
(Art. 1371, Civil Code), point unequivocally to the same conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the two shipments of logs in March and
April of 1961 the vessels "SS AEULUS" and "SS DON JOSE"
were furnished by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In several
telegraphic com­munications exchanged between the parties it was invariably <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> who requested information as to the arrival of the
vessels and appellant who gave the information <span style="">accordingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally it was appellant, through its witness <span class="SpellE">Irza</span>
<span class="SpellE">Toeg</span>, who had to explain at length during the trial
its failure to furnish the necessary vessels, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well</span>, when the shipping firms in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
learned about the failures of the vessels which we sent to Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> to load, and news travels fast from one
shipping company to the other, the other shipping companies were very hesitant
when we asked for a vessel to call at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Dolores</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They asked us whether any vessel has already gone there to load and what
is the loading rate for that particular vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So the facts of loading rates that the East <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
Lumber Mills was able to effect on the <span class="SpellE">Bunyo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maru</span> had a very bad effect in obtaining additional
vessels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other shipping companies
instructed their vessels not to go to Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
because shipping com­panies as <span style="">a </span>rule
do not want to gamble and sent vessels to a loading port when they know of the
place and they know that the people operating there would not be able to handle
the loading of the vessels judging from their past performances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">You</span> will recall that the first vessel that loaded in this
contract was a foreign vessel which was the <span class="SpellE">Bunyo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maru</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the
expected quantity of 400,000 bd. ft. of logs only 13,000 approximately was
loaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, that had a very bad
effect on the other foreign vessels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second and third vessels however were of Philippine Registry, and it was only
thru our good connection with the ship­ping company that they even permitted
their vessels to call at Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, after the three sad experiences, each one
with considerable delay in the loading time with incomplete quantities that
should have been loaded, it was difficult for us to obtain vessels to call at
that port." (T.S.N. pp. 28-30, Deposition)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of all these circumstances, appellant's claim that
it was not obligated to furnish the vessel can­not prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is next contended that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was
not in a position to comply with <span class="GramE">his own</span> obligation to
ship the quantities of logs called for under the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was sought to be proven by means of a
certificate issued by the Bureau of Forestry (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
11 &amp; 11-A), which is the off­icial record of timber cut under <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> permit, showing that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
production from January to July, 1951, amount­ed only to <span style="">1,926.64 </span>cubic meters <span style="">or 816,795 board </span>feet of logs, which
was short by 833,205 board feet of the quantity called for in the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is indeed a discrepancy between the certificate of production
issued by the Bureau of Forestry and the testimony of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Abesamis</span> regarding the <span style="">quantity </span>of timber cut under <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
permit, but this was satisfac­torily explained by him at the trial in this
wise:</p>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
my export grade <span class="GramE">logs is</span> a big quantity, and if we
immediately report those export grade logs to the Bureau of Forestry before
shipment is made, we will be paying forest charges for the logs for which we
have not received pay­ment yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we
make it <span style="">a </span>practice to re­port
only the logs that are actually shipped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The forest charges amount to so much money that we could hardly afford
to pay this in advance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was more or
less a convenience given to us by the lumber grader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And besides that, we prepare a big quantity
of logs but the lumber grader usually is instructed by the buyer to grade only
a certain portion of it because of the limitation of cargo space in buyer's
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, we have there
prepared 1,000,000 board feet but Mr. <span class="SpellE">Selga</span> is
instructed to inspect only 400,000 board feet which is the capacity of incoming
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the balance of 600, 000 board
feet could not be graded as this quantity could not be loaded."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abesamis</span> categorically stated on the
witness stand that by the <span style="">end of July
1951 </span>he had 1,300,000 board feet of logs available - 800,000 at hand and
ready for loading and the rest <span style="">deposited
at </span>various stations; and that he advised appellant of that fact in a
telegram dated <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1951</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. S), at <span style="">the
same time </span>requesting that a grader and a vessel be dispatched to Dolores
immediately as the logs were in danger of deteriorating.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Selga</span>,
lumber inspector of the Bureau of Forestry, reported to appellant that as of
July 3, 1951 <span style="">he </span>had graded <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> logs amounting to 488,015 board feet (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="SpellE">aa</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Of this quantity appellant,
in its reply tele­gram of </span><st1:date year="1951" day="13" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 13, 1951</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> BB) said that it could accept 239,547 board
feet, made up of logs at least 13 feet in length <span style="">and 20 </span>inches in diameter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, <span class="SpellE">Selga</span> likewise testified that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had other logs - some 600,000 board feet in all -
in the two barrios of <span class="SpellE">Aroganga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Genolaso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After July
3, 1951, which was the last day <span class="SpellE">Selga</span> made his
inspection, there is <span style="">evidence </span>that
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> continued its logging operations, such that <span style="">there was </span>enough to cover the quantity
called for in the contract by due date, that is, on July 31, 1951.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> <span style="">divides his claim </span>for damages into three categories, each based
on a separate breach of contract by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> maintains that due to
the failure of appellant to send a vessel <span style="">to
Dolores, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, the
storm on <st1:date year="1951" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1951</st1:date> swept
away almost all the logs then awaiting shipment, amounting to 410,000 board
feet, valued at P73, 537.77.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
point it should be noted that under the contract shipment <span style="">was </span>to <span style="">be </span>made before the end of July 1951, but not to commence earlier
than April of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
obligation between the parties was a reciprocal one, appellant to furnish the
vessel and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to furnish the logs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also an obligation with a term, which
obviously was intended for the benefit of both parties, the period having been
agreed upon in order to avoid the stormy weather in Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, during the months of January to March.
The obligation being re­ciprocal and with a period, neither party could demand
performance nor incur in delay before the expiration of the period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, when the typhoon struck on <st1:date year="1951" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1951</st1:date> there was yet no delay on
the part of appel­lant, and the corresponding loss must be shouldered by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>regards the
second breach it <span style="">has been established </span>that
after the storm of <st1:date year="1951" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1951</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellee</span></span><span style=""> continued its </span>logging
operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was advised of the
quantity of logs ready for shipment and was urged to send a vessel to take
delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thereupon gave assurance
that a vessel, the "SS ALBAY", with a capacity of 450,000 board feet,
was coming to Dolores, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
to load on <st1:date year="1951" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appel­lee</span> readied
the necessary quantity of logs but the vessel did not arrive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, 60,000 board feet of logs which
had been rafted broke loose and were lost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> loss on this account amounted to a
total of P7<span class="GramE">,685.26</span>, representing the value of the logs
lost, the cost of rafting and other incidental expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be observed in this respect that
although the obligation would not become due until <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1951</st1:date> appellant waived the benefit of the
period by assuring <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that it would take
delivery of the logs on <st1:date year="1951" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was ready to comply, but appellant failed on his commitment, without any
satisfactory explanation for such failure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, appellant should bear the corresponding loss.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third and finally, as heretofore pointed out, by the end of July
1951 <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had sufficient logs ready for shipment
in accordance with the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
appellant, in spite of the representations made by the former, failed to send a
vessel on the aforesaid date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no evi­dence that such failure was due to circumstances beyond appellant's
control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result logs <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> 800,000 board feet were destroyed by marine
borers, causing a loss of P62<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, for which
appellant should be held liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court sentenced appellant to pay P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
representing <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> loss of credit in the
operation of his business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
does not say upon what evidence the award is based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any attempt in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief to justify the amount awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actual or compensatory damages must be
established by clear evi­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
case, other than a few letters of demand for payment of money accounts received
by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from its creditors and <span style="">presented as </span>exhibits, there is
nothing to go upon, and the mere <span style="">fact
that such </span>demands were made does not necessarily prove loss of
credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">item </span>must therefore <span style="">be </span>eliminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing the judgment appealed from is affirmed,
with the <span style="">modification </span>that
appellant Woodcraft Works Ltd. is sentenced to pay <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the <span style="">aggregate sum </span>of <span style="">P69,685.26 by way of damages, plus P5,000 </span>as
attorney's fees, without costs in this instance.</p>
