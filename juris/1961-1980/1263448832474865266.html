				G.R. No. L-22628, January 31, 1967</h4>
				<H3>NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION (NASSCO), PETITIONER,
VS. THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION AND DR. OLIVER B. CORONADO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES J. B. L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO for short)
prays this Court to reverse an award of the Work­men' s Compensation Commission
ordering it to pay respondent Dr. Oliver B. Coronado compensation of P3, 521.70
, P4,581.00 for medical expenses and P264.13 attorney's fees, plus P41.00
administrative fees under section 55 of the Workmen' s Compensation Acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that Dr. Coronado was, at all times material to
this appeal, engaged by, and serving as company physician at, the NASSCO <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Steel Mills at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
at a monthly wage of P386.00, plus allowance of P50.00 a month for housing
facilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While assigned to evacuate
by <span style="">airlift an emergency case from </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Iligan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, he suffered "<span class="SpellE">Angiospastic</span>
Retino­pathy" in his left eye (disease of the retina), causing him bodily
pain requiring medical treatment, and resulting in 70% loss of vision in the
injured eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed claim with the
Workmen's Compensation Commission, which the employer corporation
resisted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was tried by Regional
Office No. XI of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>
City, whose award was, with slight modification, affirmed by the Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to obtain reconsideration, the employer appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first assignment of
error assails the jurisdiction of Regional Office No. XI to take cognizance of
the claim, under Reorganization Plan 20-A, and must be overruled, in view of
our previous holdings that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In conferring initial power to hear and decide such
(workmen's compensation) claims upon the hearing officers of the (Labor) Department's
Regional Offices, section 25 of Plan 20-A was merely reallocating powers
already possessed by the Department, and was in conformity with the authority
granted by section 6, of Republic Act No. 997, as amended by Republic Act No.
1241."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(San Miguel Brewery vs. <span class="SpellE">Sobre­mesana</span>, G. R. L-18730, September 16, 1961)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">since
the regional offices' hearing officers are in the nature of referees that the
Commission could appoint (La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span> vs. Ramos,
L-15476, September 19, 1961), and the Plan did not vest them with judicial
power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its second assignment of error, the NASSCO contends that a
doctor is not an industrial employee, and is not covered by the Workmen's
Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This stand is, like
the first error assigned, without merit, because section 3 of the Compensation
Act expressly makes said Act applicable to "<u>employees</u> and laborers
employed <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>in
the industrial concerns of the government" (of which the
petitioner-appellant NASSCO is one) as well as <span style="">"all other persons performing manual labor in the service of the
National Government and its political subdivisions or
instrumentalities".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the fact
that Dr. Coronado does not perform manual labor does not except him from the
operation of the Compensation Act (Act 3428, as amended).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the fact that Dr. Coronado's wages, including allowances,
exceed <span style="">P4, 800 </span>per annum
evidentiary that he is outside the coverage of the Compen­sation Act. Section
39 (e) of the Act defines "public employment" as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">“<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“’</span><u><span style="">(e) ' Public
employment' signifies employment in the service of the National Government and
its political sub­divisions and instrumentalities</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It
does not include</u></span><span style=""> employ­ment
as public officer elected by the popular vote nor </span><u><span style="">persons paid more than</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">four
thousand eight hundred pesos per annum.' Italics supplied)."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But Dr. Coronado's claim,
as we have seen, does not rest upon his holding "public employment"
under this section, but on section 3, where no limitation is fixed upon
earnings of the covered employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The third assignment of error assails the action of the referee
in closing <span style="">the </span>trial without
permitting the NASSCO to complete its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But as appears from the appealed decision, and is supported by the
record, the <span style="">NASSCO had </span>managed
to secure not less than four postponements, the last being granted <span style="">on </span>condition that no further
postponement will be allowed; and yet, despite <span style="">such </span>warning, the NASSCO counsel nevertheless requested
postponement by telegram, and this request was, upon proper objection, denied
by the hearing officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see neither
error nor abuse of discretion in such action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just because NASSCO happens to be a government controlled corporation
does not entitle it to delay trial indefinitely to suit its convenience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's fourth and final assignment of error refers to the
sufficiency of the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
claimed that the decision under appeal is not supported <span style="">by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
claim is belied by the record, since it shows that the decision is predicated
upon the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villacorta</span>, a specialist
who treated the claimant, that the latter' s ailment could have been caused by
abrupt changes in atmospheric pressure in the course of an airplane
flight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supported as it is by the
certifications </span><span style="">of Drs. <span class="SpellE">Tamesis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>, also
specialists in eye diseases, this evidence certainly constitutes substantial
evidence to support the findings of the Com­mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that the claimant's
hypertension was a contributing factor, the same does not suffice to relieve
the employer of responsibility, since aggravation of a preexisting disease,
when caused by working conditions, entitles the claimant to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have heretofore pointed out that, because
of the statutory presumption of compensability, the burden is on the employer
to show that the injury could not have been caused by the nature or </span>conditions
of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

error in the decision appealed from, the same is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner-appellant National
