				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><em>The Case.</em>—Petitioner &nbsp;seeks to annul &nbsp;the order &nbsp;of the respondent judge removing him as receiver, and appoint- ing &nbsp;Martin T. Bacaron in his place. <p><em>Material &nbsp;Facts.</em>—In &nbsp;March, 1957, Alcantara &nbsp;sued &nbsp;Bacaron &nbsp; partly to foreclose &nbsp;the chattel &nbsp;mortgage executed by the latter on a caterpillar tractor with its accessories (Civil Case No. 2282 of Davao). &nbsp;Pursuant to a &nbsp;clause in the mortgage &nbsp;contract, the &nbsp;Davao &nbsp;court designated Alcantara as &nbsp;receiver of the tractor; and he duly qualified Alcantara <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hon. &nbsp;Abbas, &nbsp;et al. as such. &nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, with the court's approval, &nbsp;he leased the machine to Serapio Sablada, &nbsp;Upon the expiration of the lease, &nbsp;and &nbsp;after &nbsp;Sablada's &nbsp;failure &nbsp;to return &nbsp;the machine, said court at the instance of Alcantara,<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup> declared Sablada to &nbsp;be in &nbsp;contempt of court and fined him &nbsp;in &nbsp;the amount of &nbsp;P100.00 on October &nbsp;6, 1958.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on October 2, 1958, alleging that &nbsp;Alcantara had neglected his &nbsp;duties &nbsp;as receiver, because he did &nbsp;not get the tractor, Bacaron &nbsp;petitioned &nbsp;the court &nbsp;to relieve such &nbsp;receiver, &nbsp;and &nbsp;to appoint &nbsp;him &nbsp;(Bacaron) &nbsp;as &nbsp;the receiver instead.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup>&nbsp;Opposing the petition, &nbsp; Alcantara made the following manifestations, in a pleading to &nbsp;the &nbsp;court dated &nbsp; November &nbsp;26, &nbsp;1958:</p> <blockquote> <p>"2. That &nbsp;in fact &nbsp;the &nbsp;herein plaintiff-receiver &nbsp;has &nbsp; exerted &nbsp;all efforts to secure the possession &nbsp;of the tractor in question, and &nbsp;has come to &nbsp;court time and again to compel the lessee, Serapio Sablada to deliver &nbsp;the tractor to the &nbsp;receiver, but it seems &nbsp;that even the Honorable Court is at the mercy of &nbsp;said &nbsp;Serapio &nbsp;Sablada;</p> <p>"3. That &nbsp;in fact, until &nbsp;and &nbsp;unless the tractor is delivered &nbsp;to the receiver as &nbsp;ordered &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;Honorable Court, &nbsp; the said Serapio Sablada, is liable &nbsp;to the &nbsp;Honorable Court for continuous contempt in as much as the subject of the contempt is non-compliance with the order of &nbsp;the Honorable Court; * * *</p> <p>"6. That &nbsp;in view of the &nbsp;attendant &nbsp;circumstances related to &nbsp;the tractor in this case, it is most respectfully prayed that the plaintiff-receiver be immediately authorized to file a case of replevin with damages against, the &nbsp;person of &nbsp;Serapio Sablada, holding his &nbsp;surety bond liable therefor, &nbsp;if proper, as the most &nbsp;legal and &nbsp;expedient procedure to retake the tractor &nbsp;in question.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, &nbsp;despite &nbsp;the &nbsp;above &nbsp;&nbsp;representations, &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondent &nbsp; judge of the Davao &nbsp;court, &nbsp;in &nbsp;an &nbsp;order &nbsp;&nbsp;dated December .10, 1958, relieved Alcantara and &nbsp;appointed Bacaron &nbsp;&nbsp;as &nbsp;receiver &nbsp;of the tractor, without &nbsp;bond, &nbsp;with authority &nbsp;to receive the sum of P2,000.00 in Alcantara's hands &nbsp;as &nbsp;rentals &nbsp;of the &nbsp;tractor, and &nbsp;to spend &nbsp;the &nbsp;same for repairs if necessary.</p> <p>His motion to reconsider having been denied, Alcantara filed with this Court the instant special civil action. &nbsp;&nbsp;And at his &nbsp;request, &nbsp;a &nbsp;preliminary &nbsp;injunction was issued &nbsp;to restrain enforcement of His Honor's aforesaid order &nbsp;of December &nbsp;10, 1958. &nbsp;</p> <p><em>The questions are: &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>(a) &nbsp;the propriety of &nbsp;Alcantara's removal; and &nbsp;(b) &nbsp;the legality &nbsp;of Bacaron's appointment and &nbsp;qualifications.</p> <p><em>Discussion.</em>—It appears that acting on the complaint of Alcantara on September 11, 1958, (3) the court required Sablada &nbsp;under &nbsp;pain of &nbsp;contempt, to deliver &nbsp;the &nbsp;tractor on or before &nbsp;September &nbsp;30, &nbsp;1958,<sup><font color="#ff0000">[3]</font> </sup> at the junction of the Davao Penal Colony &nbsp;Road and the &nbsp;National Road going to Agusan in Panabo, &nbsp;Agusan. &nbsp;It also appears that upon Sablada's failure, he was &nbsp;declared &nbsp;to be in contempt &nbsp;on October 6, 1958, and fined P100.00—as previously stated. The &nbsp;order further &nbsp;said &nbsp;.that upon failure to &nbsp;pay in one week, &nbsp;he will be imprisoned for ten days. &nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, &nbsp;the order directed Alcantara to take steps to recover &nbsp;posses- sion &nbsp;of the tractor, with the admonition that "should &nbsp;he fail to take &nbsp;possession of &nbsp;the tractor within fifteen &nbsp;(15) days after notice thereof, &nbsp;he may be &nbsp;relieved &nbsp;as receiver and the defendant who is willing to &nbsp;be the receiver &nbsp;may be appointed in his place."</p> <p>Then &nbsp;on December &nbsp;10, 1958, the court—overlooking or overruling Alcantara's pleading—issued &nbsp;the &nbsp;order &nbsp;now in question, which for &nbsp;convenience &nbsp;is quoted below:</p> <p>"It appearing that plaintiff-receiver failed to take &nbsp;steps to take possession of the tractor &nbsp;leased to Sablada and bring it to Davao City as directed in the Order &nbsp;of this Court dated October 6, &nbsp;1958, the &nbsp;plaintiffis &nbsp;hereby &nbsp;relieved &nbsp;as receiver, and in his stead &nbsp;the defendant is hereby appointed &nbsp;as receiver without bond. &nbsp;Upon &nbsp;his qualification as such receiver, the defendant is hereby authorized to receive from the plaintiff the &nbsp;sum &nbsp;of P2,000.00 representing &nbsp;the rentals received by the latter from Sablada &nbsp; for &nbsp;the use of &nbsp;the tractor, &nbsp;and to &nbsp;spend said &nbsp;sum or so much thereof as &nbsp;may be necessary for bringing the tractor to Davao City and for &nbsp;payment of necessary repairs; and the plaintiff is hereby &nbsp;ordered to turn over to the &nbsp;defendant the said sum of P2,000.00 on demand." It is not clear what steps &nbsp;the court had in mind when it declared that &nbsp;"plaintiff-receiver failed to &nbsp;take steps to take possession of the tractor leased to &nbsp; Sablada." &nbsp;It could &nbsp;not &nbsp;have meant that &nbsp;Alcantara failed to take the tractor directly from the &nbsp;hands of &nbsp;Sablada &nbsp;from &nbsp;the place &nbsp;where &nbsp;it &nbsp; was, <i>without &nbsp;resorting to &nbsp;official help.</i> If &nbsp;the . court &nbsp;meant—as &nbsp;&nbsp;it &nbsp;must &nbsp;&nbsp;have &nbsp;meant—that Alcantara &nbsp;failed &nbsp;to &nbsp;exhaust judicial &nbsp;remedies to &nbsp;compel Sablada to comply with the &nbsp;order to &nbsp; place &nbsp;the tractor at the &nbsp;"junction" previously &nbsp;mentioned, &nbsp;then &nbsp;it &nbsp; fell into error, because &nbsp;Alcantara &nbsp;had &nbsp;in effect, suggested that Sablada be held in "continuous contempt" (Annex J) i.e., <i>imprisoned until</i> he placed the &nbsp;tractor at the "junction"; and the court &nbsp;instead of &nbsp;acting accordingly under Rule 64, sec. 7<sup><font color="#ff0000">[4]</font></sup> held Alcantara &nbsp;to &nbsp;be negligent, &nbsp;and removed him.</p> <p>In &nbsp;this &nbsp;connection, it should be observed that in his aforesaid pleading of November 26, 1958, Alcantara even asked <i>for permission to sue</i> Sablada for replevin. </p> <p>If &nbsp;it was error to remove &nbsp;Alcantara, a &nbsp;clearer error occured when Bacaron— the &nbsp;defendant—was appointed as receiver without &nbsp;bond, &nbsp;over the objection &nbsp;&nbsp;of &nbsp;Alcantara —the plaintiff. &nbsp;The general &nbsp;rule is that &nbsp;neither party to &nbsp;a &nbsp;litigation &nbsp;should be appointed receiver without the other's consent<sup> <font color="#ff0000">[5]</font></sup>&nbsp;because &nbsp;"a &nbsp;receiver &nbsp;ought to be &nbsp;an indifferent &nbsp;person between the parties" <sup><font color="#ff0000">[6]</font></sup> and &nbsp; "should be impartial &nbsp;and &nbsp;disinterested"<sup><font color="#ff0000">[7]</font></sup>. &nbsp; Note &nbsp;that &nbsp;&nbsp;Bacaron was the &nbsp;defendant, &nbsp;and &nbsp;his &nbsp;personal &nbsp; interest would &nbsp;conflict with his duties &nbsp;to &nbsp;the court and the plaintiff.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[8]</font></sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, &nbsp;under the Rules of &nbsp;Court, the receiver must file a bond; &nbsp;and yet &nbsp;Bacaron &nbsp;was &nbsp;exempted &nbsp;from &nbsp;such &nbsp; obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;effect &nbsp;of the &nbsp;whole proceeding &nbsp;was &nbsp;to discharge the receivership at the request of tlje defendant, without so much as a bond—contrary to sec. &nbsp;4, Rule 61, of the Rules of Court.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[9]</font></sup></p> <p><i>Conclusion</i>.—Such &nbsp;mistakes &nbsp;causing prejudice to &nbsp;petitioner,, call &nbsp;for interference with &nbsp;that &nbsp;discretion which usuaHy vest in trial courts in &nbsp;the &nbsp;matter of receivership. Consequently, &nbsp;the order of December 10, 1958, should &nbsp;be and is hereby annulled. &nbsp;Costs against respondent Bacaron.</p> <p>So &nbsp;ordered.</p> <p><i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup> And of Bacaron.<p></p> <p><sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup> He also complained against Sablada.</p> <p><sup><font color="#ff0000">[3]</font></sup> And of Bacaron.</p> <p><sup><font color="#ff0000">[4]</font></sup> Sec. &nbsp;7.
