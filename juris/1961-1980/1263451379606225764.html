				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a petition for naturalization filed before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, petitioner Alfonso Po
<span class="SpellE">Chu</span> King alleged that he was born on July 18, 1936 at
<span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, although he has been residing at <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City since 1945; that he is single, 25 years old,
and a citizen of Nationalist China; that he speaks and writes <span style="">the </span>English language and the <span class="SpellE">Cebu-Visayan</span> dialect; that <span style="">he </span>is a businessman by trade or profession, being an employee
and a stockholder of the Po Sun <span class="SpellE">Que</span> Sons Corporation from
which he derived an annual income of P3,000.00, more or less; and that he is
exempt from filing a declaration of intention because he was born in the
Philippines and g<span style="">raduated from high </span>school
at the <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> Chinese School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further alleged that he believed
in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution; that he has <span style="">conducted himself in a proper and
irreproachable manner during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines;
that he has mingled socially with the Filipinos and evinced a sincere desire to
embrace their customs, traditions and ideals; that he is not opposed to
organized government; that he is not a polygamist nor a believer in polygamy;
that he was never convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude; and that he
is not suffering from any incurable contagious disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, petitioner claims that he has all
the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to be a Filipino citizen
as provided in the Naturalization Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was accompanied by the joint affidavits of two
character witnesses, namely, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lago</span> and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the requisite publication, the case was
heard on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government, which was represented by the
City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City, did not file any formal
opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1962</st1:date>, the lower court rendered a
decision finding petitioner qualified for Philippine citi­zenship and granted
the petition for naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due
time, the Solicitor General interposed the present appeal to this Court, assigning
the following errors:</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The lower court erred in not finding

to sustain the allegations in their joint affidavit supporting the petition.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the appeal
meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>is <span style="">alleged in the petition for naturalization
that petitioner is exempt from filing </span>a <span style="">declaration of intention for having been born in the Philippines and
had graduated from a high school recognized by the Government of the
Philippines and not limited to any </span>race <span style="">or nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner,
however, did not mention in his petition, <span class="GramE">nor</span> in his
testimony, the primary or elementary schools that he attended; and no evidence
whatsoever was presented to show that the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ozamis</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Chinese</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">School</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> where he finished his high school is an
institution recognized by the Government and not limited to any race or nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held that </span>a <span style="">petitioner for naturalization, who fails to
mention in his petition </span>the <span style="">schools
where he finished his elementary and secondary education and fails to prove
that the elementary and high schools he attended were recognized by the
Government and not limited </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">any race or nationality, </span>is <span style="">not exempt from filing </span>a <span style="">declaration of intention, as provided in
Sections 5 and 6 of the Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act 473, as amended by
Commonwealth Act 535).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Considering that section 6 of the Naturalization Law expressly requires that to
be exempt from filing declarations of intention Philippine-born applicants
must; <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, have received <u>both</u>
<u><span style="">primary</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>and</u> <u><span style="">secondary</span></u><span style=""> </span>education
in public schools or those recognized by the Government and not limited to any
race or nationality; that there is no evidence that the Manila Chinese School
(where petitioner received primary education) was not limited <span style="">to </span>any race or nationality, but, on
the contrary, its name clearly imported that it was limited to Chinese students
<span style="">(cf. </span>Wang I. Fu <span style="">vs. </span>Republic, L-15819, Sept. 29, 1962;
<span class="SpellE">Hao</span> Su <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> vs. Republic,
L-13045, July 30, 1962; <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sy</span></span><span style=""> See vs. </span>Republic,
L-17025, May 30, 1962); <span style="">and considering
that the burden lies on applicant to satisfactorily show that all schools attended
by him are not limited to students of a particular nationality, but are regularly
attended by a sizable number of Filipino students from whom applicant could
have </span>imbibed <span style="">Filipino customs
and traditions, we agree that petitioner should have filed in due time his
declaration of intention, and not having done so, his application was erroneously
granted." (Len v. Republic, L-20151, March 31, 1965; emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is to be noted from the above-quoted allegation that
petitioner omitted to mention the school where he received his primary education
and whether or not the primary school <span style="">he
attended is recognized by the Government </span>and not limited to <span style="">any race </span>or nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony at the hearing before the
trial court, petitioner declared that he studied from the third grade of the
elementary course up to the first year high school at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Hope</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Christian</st1:placename> <st1:placename>High School</st1:placename></st1:place>
(formerly <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Chia</span></u></span><u><span style="">-Nan</span></u></st1:placename><u><span style=""> </span></u><st1:placetype><u><span style="">School</span></u></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">), </span><span style="">a </span>school run and managed by Chinese and where he did <u>not</u>
have Filipino classmates but only Filipino teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is a certification issued by
the Bureau of Private Schools, dated April 3, 1962, stating that said Hope
Christian High School is recognized by the Government, and another
certification issued by the Principal of the same school, dated February 6,
1962, stating that said school <span style="">is </span>not
limited to any race or nationality, no proof was submitted to show that at the
time petitioner was enrolled and studying at the said school it was not limited
to any <span style="">race </span>or nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The importance of this factor in petitioner's
early education lies in the fact that it is in the formative early years of
schooling that the more lasting impressions are received and absorbed by the
child's mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His imbibing our customs
and traditions, therefore, depends in the greater extent upon his opportunities
to mingle with Filipinos while receiving elementary education.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For these deficiencies (omission to state in the petition the
school which petitioner attended and where he received his primary education
and failure to satisfy this Court that <span class="SpellE">Chia</span>-Nan
School (now Hope Christian High School) was not limited to any race or
nationality at the time petitioner attended it), we hold that petitioner <span style="">is </span>not exempted from filing a
declaration of intention, contrary to his contention." (<span class="SpellE">Sia</span> v. Republic, L-20290, August 31, 1965)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as the Solicitor General points out, there is no
sufficient evidence in the record which establishes the fact that the
petitioner was born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner tried to prove the fact of his
having been born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by his own testimony and by the <span style="">affidavits
of his mother and his older brother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These affiants - his mother and his brother - did not take the witness
stand so that they could not be cross-examined by the representative of the G</span><span style="">overnment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">The petitioner presented
his alien certificate of registration and his immigrant certificate of </span><span style="">residence, also </span><span style="">to prove the fact of his birth in the </span><span style="">Philippines; </span><span style="">but these two certificates, like the affidavits of his mother and
brother, are hearsay evidence and therefore not satisfactory to prove the fact
of petitioner's birth in the Philippines.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> No explanation was offered by petitioner why

</span><span style="">had been lost or destroyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It having been </span>shown
that the petitioner has not established that he is exempt from filing a
declaration of intention, and it appearing that he had not filed a declaration
of intention one year before the filing of his petition for <span style="">naturalization </span>as required by law, the
lower court erred when it granted the instant petition for <span style="">naturalization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General
also correctly points out that petitioner does not have a lucrative trade or
profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears in the income tax
return of the petitioner for </span><span style="">1961,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">that

represents </span><span style="">his salary and
P1,000.00 as bonus, from the Po Sun </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Que</span></span><span style=""> Sons Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that "contingent </span><span style="">income,
like bonuses and commissions, do not constitute dependable remuneration
entitled to consideration in deter­mining lucrative trade or work for the
purposes of the Naturalization Law"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> because "they are, by their nature, in­definite

<p class="BODY">A cursory examination of the joint affidavit of pe­titioner's
character witnesses reveal that they practically reiterated what is contained
in it when they testified in court, without giving any instance showing why
petitioner, if admitted to Philippine citizenship, would be a good citizen of
the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when asked the
question, "what is your impression of petitioner's conduct toward the
community and the constituted authority?<span class="GramE">",</span> their
answers were either, he is good, satisfactory, or law-abid­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when further queried:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Do you believe that the petitioner
possesses the qualifications necessary to be­come a Filipino citizen?<span class="GramE">",</span> their answer is, "Yes, sir." In the case
of Santiago Ng v. Republic, L-16302, <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1962</st1:date>, this Court declared:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The belief expressed by the witnesses that the petitioner would
make a good citizen, and that they recommend his admission to Filipino
citizenship, is a mere conclusion unsupported by facts, and, therefore, an
opinion entitled to no weight."</p>
