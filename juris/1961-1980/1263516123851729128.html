<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1956</st1:date>,
the spouses <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> executed another deed of sale with

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, said three-year period was reduced When on October
29, 1959, the Falcon spouses executed, with the conformity of the <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> spouses, an option to repurchase the same properties
within two years from said date of the new option, i.e., two years from October
29, 1959, or up to October 29, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still later, on September 15, 1960, another deed of absolute sale
over the right to the land and "my house" was executed by Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, with his wife's consent, in favor of the Falcon
spouses, for P6,160.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 1960, the Land Tenure Administration executed a deed
of sale over the lot in favor of Corazon Falcon, married to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
Falcon, for P2<span class="GramE">,799.00</span> which she paid for the land
after buying the rights of the <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transfer Certificate of Title No. 61925 over
the lot was issued on <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="11">November 25,

H).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1961</st1:date>,
Corazon Falcon executed an "Op­tion to Re-Sell" which stated as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That I, CORAZON M. FALCON, Filipino, of legal age, married to
<span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Falcon, residing at 1183 Int. 5, <span class="SpellE">Agno</span> Street, Ma­nila, and the owners of Lot 5-C-3, Block
511 of the Ana <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> Estate, with an area of 93.3
square meters, embraced in T. C.T. No. 61925, do hereby obligate myself to
re-sell in favor of FELICIANO OROBIA, Fi­lipino, of legal age, married to
Isabel <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> and residing at 46-A <span class="SpellE">Mckinley</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
above-mentioned parcel of land for a con­sideration at anytime the said
Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Oro­bia</span> is financially able to buy the same
sub­ject to the condition that the Selling Price of the said lot shall be
determined and fixed on date of the resale of the lot to Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That this option is exclusive and that I shall not sell the
said lot to any person without the knowledge and consent of Felicia­no <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
II)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Spouses <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1962</st1:date>, sought to repurchase the land (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. VII) <span class="GramE">invoking</span> the
abovementioned "Option to Re-Sell".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The parties, however, could not agree on the price.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 2, 1962, the Falcon spouses filed against the <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span> spouses the present suit in the Court of First Ins­tance
for specific performance, to recover the land and houses, and for accounting of
the civil fruits of the two houses from May 11, 1956, the said properties
having re­mained during all this time in the actual possession of said
defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answer with counterclaim was filed by the <span class="SpellE">Orobia</span>
spouses on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs answered the counterclaim on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>,
<u>the parties agreed on a stipu­lation of facts</u>, which the court approved,
regarding the admission of the documents above referred to and limiting the
case to three issues:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the two (2) houses erected and
situated in the property described in EXHIBIT "H" are deemed included
in the DEED OF SALES executed by the herein defendants in favor of plaintiffs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span> Whether or not the real intention of the
parties as regards the Contract of Sale of right over the lot includes the two
houses or whether or not the following documents re­flected the real intention
of the parties in accordance with Exhibits 'I', 'III' and 'IV' of the
defendants; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the plaintiffs may be compelled
to sell the property in question to the defendants by virtue of the 'OPTION TO
RE­SELL', EXHIBIT 'II', signed by one of the plaintiffs Corazon .M.
Falcon." (Record on Ap­peal, p. 109)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Rendering judgment on June 5, 1961, the Court of First Instance
held that the deed of sale clearly inclu­ded the two houses; that the letters
exchanged before the transaction do not mention the houses, but the deed of
sale expressly includes them; and that defendants had not accepted the last
"Option to Re-Sell" and it has been revoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appeal was taken to <span class="GramE">Us</span> directly by
defendants to raise questions purely of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The deeds of sale (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span>
B and C) clearly include the two houses in the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the consideration was increased from
P1<span class="GramE">,540.00</span> to P6,160.00 when the new deed was executed
adding the said houses in the sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).
Defendants alleged that usurious interest ac­counted for the increase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No proof of this was given, and the
allegation was specifically denied under oath. As to the letters, it is not
surprising that they do not mention the houses, since the sale of the houses was
decided only later on, resulting in the execution of a new deed of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the "Option to Re-Sell", defendants offered
to buy the land but did not mention to their offer the price <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, which the option stated must be determined when
the resale is made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
defendants insisted on repurchasing at the price of P6<span class="GramE">,160.00</span>
but plaintiffs wanted P10,154.05. Hence, there was fail­ure to agree on the
price and thus the "Option to Re-Sell" could not be availed of by
defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the land could not be sold without the consent of
the Land Tenure Administration (See Condition in the Title Certificate, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H), which <u>was sought but not given</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
