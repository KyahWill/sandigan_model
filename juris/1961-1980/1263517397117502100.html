				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that this petition for the review of a decision
of respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission recognizing the right to
compensation of an employee suffering from <span class="GramE">epilepsy resulting</span>
from a fall while on duty, his head hit­ting the cement floor, and rejecting
the defense that the cause was idiopathic, is not without its element of
novelty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was given due
course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, there is no warrant
for a deviation from, much less a disregard of, settled doctrines to which we
have consistently and repeatedly adhered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is our view that on the facts as found by respondent Commission, petitioner,
Operators, Incorporated, cannot escape from the liability imposed by law to pay
the compensation awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to
reverse the clear policy of the Workmen's Compensation Act as reflected explicitly
in its provisions and in a host of decisions rendered by us if in this case the
persistence of the employer to avoid payment would meet with success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That, we are not disposed
to do.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by respondent Workmen's Compensation
Commission follow:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Records
disclose that claimant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span> was first
employed by the American Biscuit Company, Inc. as a cook in 1939 and continue
as such until he stopped work­ing at the outbreak of the war; that after
liberation he returned and worked as a mixer and cook in the sweets department,
then he was transferred to the coating department where his job consisted of
cooling the pan and cooking gums used in the making of <span class="SpellE">chicklets</span>;
that claimant was receiving <span style="">a </span>daily wage of P10.00 and worked six (6) days a week; that on
May 7, 1954 while claimant was actually in line of duty, he suddenly lost
consciousness and fell; that because of said fall, his head hit the cement
floor; that this incident was seen by claimant's foreman and companion at the
time, Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, who lifted him and placed him
on the table outside the coating department; that as a result of said accident,
claimant was taken to the San Juan de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Hospital
where he was confined up to May 8, 1954; that after his discharge from the said
hospital, claimant was treated at home for two (2) weeks by Dr. Luzon Cruz;
that because Dr. Cruz found the claimant suffering from epilepsy, the latter
was brought to the National Mental Hospital on May 28, 1954; that at the time
of claimant's discharge from the National Mental Hospital, he was [suffering
from hallucinations]; that he can be ill all his life unless the injury to his
head is pinpointed; that claimant's accident was not reported to the
management; and that after the incident, claimant was not able to report for
duty with the respondents, as a matter of fact, he is still at present
physically disabled to perform any kind of work."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was likewise stated in the above decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Records also reveal that claimant's
sudden loss of consciousness on May 7, 1954 was due to abnormal discharge of
electrical brain waves which is not epilepsy; <span style="">as a </span>matter of fact such abnormal
discharge of electrical brain waves may happen even to a normal individual;
that epilepsy although hereditary may also be caused by an injury to the head
due to a fall; that nobody in the family of the claimant had the disease of
epilepsy; and that claimant prior to his accident on May 7, 1954 was not
afflicted by the said disease."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light <span style="">of </span>the above, respondent Commission reached this
conclusion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Certainly, considered
in the light of the foregoing factual background, there could hardly be any
doubt that the pre­ponderance of probabilities veers towards the direction that
the injury to the head sustained by the claimant when his head hit the <span style="">cement floor on May 7, 1954 while actually in
the course of his employment must have caused his ailment of epilepsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the claimant who was known to
be free from epilepsy was found afflicted with the disease after his
aforementioned accident on May 7, 1954 and the medical testimony of Dr. Gerardo
<span class="SpellE">Lumba</span> who had a hand in the treatment of claimant's
illness while he was confined at the National Mental Hospital that the injury
he sustained when he fell and his head hit the cement floor might have caused
his epilepsy, more than justify this conclusion."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal error
assigned in the brief of petitioner is that respondent Commission, instead of
reaching the above conclusion, should have held that the epilepsy was due to a
pre-existing disease, idiopathic in character, caused by extraneous factors
other than the condition of employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner would thus have us disregard the above findings of facts,
which commend itself for its plausibility and reasonableness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, we cannot do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we said in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Co., Inc. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
decided only a few months ago, will explain why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Again, petitioner ought to have been aware that under the doctrine
repeatedly announced by this Court, the above findings of fact are not for us
to review or to disregard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They bind us;
we have to accept their conclusive character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be different if there is no support in the proof offered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are based on the substantial evidence of
record."</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can it be said that
petitioner was successful in its effort to show that the claimant's condition
was idiopathic in charac­ter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
would stress in its brief:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Even
assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> only that the epilepsy was
contracted by the claimant in the course of his employment with herein
petitioner; nevertheless, the same is not compensable, because it was an
[idiopathic disease] <u>caused primarily by conditions inherent in his physical
constitution and aggravated by the circumstances of his personal life</u>,
among which were the evening classes he attended as a civil engineering
student, the preparation he had to make for the final examinations, and the
emotional difficulties he was having with his sweetheart, <span class="SpellE">Arsenia</span>
Calderon, climaxed by his violent quarrel with her at about a quarter to one
o'clock in the afternoon of May 7, 1954."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The solidity of the proof offered on behalf of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span>
would render futile such an attempt to ascribe the resulting illness to causes
other than that found in the decision now under review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a matter of fact, it
cannot be accurately stated that this attempt of petitioner suffices to
overcome the statutory presumption that in the absence of substantial evidence
to the contrary, the claim comes within the provision of the Workmen's
Compensation Act.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The burden of proof is therefore on the
employer resisting the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat,
petitioner here was unsuccessful in such attempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence of a much stronger character is
needed to justify a reversal of the conclusion reached by respondent
Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A decision from an
American state court would make even more evident why reliance on, the alleged
idiopathic character of the epileptic condition of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span> is futile.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Chicago Park District v. Industrial Commission,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a similar contention that epilepsy was a
latent disease which was "brought into activity and aggravated" by
the employee who had gone into a tool shed and was struck by a heavy door as he
came out was rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This court has held that where
pre-existing conditions of diseases are aggravated by an accidental injury, the
disability resulting from such aggravation is compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * The disputed questions of fact were
heard by the arbitrator and the Commission, and their finding is confirmed by
the superior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We </span>are <span style="">unable to say that their finding in that
matter was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, and unless it is so
contrary this court has uniformly held it will not disturb the finding of the
commission."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since, as noted at the
outset, this petition raised a novel question, another American decision,
likewise from a state court, may be cited for its persuasive force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Rialto Mining Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Yokum</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the facts as found by the court follow:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The record discloses that on the 16th
day of November, 1927, claimant, while in the employ of the Rialto Mining
Company, sustained an injury to </span>his left eye, which resulted in a total
loss of vision thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was allowed <span style="">a </span>lump sum award <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
in the sum of $1,193.38, which amount has been fully paid by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter claimant contracted epilepsy, and
on <st1:date year="1931" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1931</st1:date>, he filed a
motion to reopen the case because of a change in condition, and prayed that he
be awarded additional compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion was granted by the commission, and upon further hearing claimant was
allowed additional compensation because of temporary total disability."</p>

<p class="BODY">The employer would on the above facts emphasize what it
considered the speculative character of the evidence relied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma was not
impressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The award is challenged by petitioners
on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to sustain it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence is conclusive that since the
former award claimant contracted the disease of epilepsy and that he has
suffered disability by reason thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the contention of petitioners that the evidence is insufficient to
sustain the finding of the commission that this condition was caused by the
original injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injury was caused
by a boulder striking claimant in the eye while he was engaged in breaking
rock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is some evidence in the
record tending to establish that his present condition is due to this
injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three physicians testified in
the case, and, while they agree that the origin of epilepsy has not yet been
definitely discovered by medical science, and that its origin is highly
speculative, yet they agree that it frequently results from trauma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also agree that there are several
different types of this disease, among which is a type known as <span class="SpellE">Jacksonian</span> epilepsy, and that this type of disease is
frequently caused by trauma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *
Petitioners contend that the award is based on mere conjecture and
speculation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with this
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is some evidence in
the record from which the conclusion can be reached that claimant's present
condition is in all probability due to the original injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is sufficient." For us, likewise,
the evidence relied upon by respondent <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span> and
found persuasive by respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission cannot just be
ignored or brushed aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
justification for a con­clusion that would set at naught <span class="GramE">claimant's</span>
right to compensation.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the principal error
assigned thus disposed of, it is easily understandable why the judgment should
be one of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are other errors attributed to respondent Commission, but they are
inconsequential in character.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is much too late in the day to complain about the long delay
in instituting the claim here of seven years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court in 1965 cate­gorically declared that the failure to file a
claim within the statutory period does not affect the jurisdiction of the
Workmen's Compensation <span style="">Commission.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Such

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could it be said, as
likewise alleged in the brief of <span class="GramE">petitioner, that</span> the
pecuniary liability imposed on it is not in accordance with the provisions of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in the decision of
the hearing officer which in turn was affirmed by re­spondent Commission:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Under Section 14 of the Act as amended,
an employee or worker disabled for labor shall be entitled to 60% of his
average weekly wage during the entire period of his dis­ability but not to
exceed 208 weeks nor the aggregate sum in its entirety exceed P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely
from <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1954</st1:date> up to the
present is more than 208 weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Records
show that claimant's average weekly wage was P60.00 (P10.00 x 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sixty per cent of P60.00 is P36.00 or P35.00
the maximum allowed by the Act and for 208 weeks claimant is entitled to P7<span class="GramE">,280.00</span> <span style="">or </span>P4,000.00,
the maximum allowed under the Act."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It suffices, <span style="">therefore, in the decision
under review, </span>for the respondent Commission to state:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We also find on review that the computation
of the amount of com­pensation stated in the decision under consideration is in
accordance with the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as
amended."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no occasion to pass upon the question of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
as respondent Commission did consider and did reject, in view of its lack of
persuasive character, the defense offered by petitioner.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, respondent <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span> had fully established his right under the law to
compensation, and respondent Commission necessarily had to respect and enforce
that right.</p>
