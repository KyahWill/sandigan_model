				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The basic issue posed by petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue
in this appeal from a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals as to whether or not
the requisites of statehood, or at least much thereof as may be necessary for
the acquisition of an inter­national personality, must be satisfied for a
"foreign country" to fall within the exemption of Section 122 of the
National Internal Revenue Code<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is now ripe for adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of Tax Appeals answered the question in the negative, and thus reversed the
action taken by petitioner Collector, who would hold respondent Antonio Campos <span class="SpellE">Rueda</span>, as administrator of the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Cerdeira</span>, liable for the
sum of P161,874.95 as deficiency estate and inheritance taxes for the transfer
of intangible personal properties in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the deceased, a Spanish national having been a resident of <st1:place><st1:city>Tangier</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Morocco</st1:country-region></st1:place> from 1931 up to
the time of her death in 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an
earlier resolution promulgated <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="5">May 30,
 1962</st1:date>, this Court on the assumption that the need for resolving the
principal question would be obviated, referred the matter back to the Court of
Tax Appeals to determine whether the alleged law of Tangier did grant the
reciprocal tax exemption required by the aforesaid Section 122.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came an order from the Court of Tax
Appeals submitting copies of legislation of Tangier that would manifest that
the element of reciprocity was not lack­ing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not until <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1969</st1:date>
that the case was deemed submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the petition for review was filed on <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1958</st1:date>, the basic issue raised
was impressed with an element of novelty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Four days thereafter, however, on <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="1">January
 6, 1958</st1:date>, it was held by this Court that the aforesaid provision
does not require that the "foreign country" possess an international
personality to come within its terms.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, we have to affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, now under review, sets
forth the background facts as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This is an appeal interposed by petitioner Antonio Campos <span class="SpellE">Rueda</span>, as administrator of the estate of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> Maria de la <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Cerdeira</span>, from the decision of the respondent Collector of
Internal Revenue, assessing against and demanding from the former the sum of
P161,874.95 as deficiency estate and inheritance taxes, including interests and
penalties, on the transfer of in­tangible personal properties situated in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and belong­ing to said Maria de la <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Cerdeira</span>, Maria de la <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Cerdeira</span> (Maria <span class="SpellE">Cerdeira</span> for
short) is a Spanish national by reason of her marriage to a Spanish citizen and
was a resident of <st1:place><st1:city>Tangier</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Morocco</st1:country-region></st1:place>
from 1931 up to her death on <st1:date year="1955" day="2" month="1">January 2,
 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of her
demise she left, among others, intangible personal properties in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this portion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1955</st1:date>, petitioner filed
a provisional estate and inheritance tax return on all the properties of the
late Maria <span class="SpellE">Cerdeira</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same date, respondent, pending investigation, issued an
assessment for estate and inheritance taxes in the respective amounts of
P111,592.48 and P157,791.48, or a total of P269,383.96, which tax liabilities
were paid by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1955" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1955</st1:date>, an amended return
was filed * * * wherein intangible personal properties with the value of
P396,308.90 were claimed as exempted from taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 23, 1955, respondent, pending
investigation, issued another assessment for estate and inheritance taxes in
the amounts of P202,262.40 and P267,402.84, respectively, or a total of
P469,665.24 * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated <st1:date year="1956" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1956</st1:date>, respondent denied
the request for exemption on the ground that the law of Tangier is not
reciprocal to Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, respondent demanded the payment of the
sums of P239,439.49 representing deficiency estate and inheritance taxes
including <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> penalties,
surcharges, interests and compromise penalties * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter, dated February 8, 1956, and
received by respondent on the following day, petitioner request ed for the
reconsideration of the decision denying the claim for tax exemption of the
intangible personal properties and the imposition of the 25% and 5% <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> penalties * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, respondent denied this request, in
his letter dated <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1956</st1:date>
* * * and received by petitioner on <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="5">May
 21, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
premised the denial on the grounds that there was no reciprocity [with Tangier,
which was moreover] a mere principality, not a foreign country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, respondent demanded the payment
of the sums of P73,851.21 and P88,023.74 respectively, or a total of
P161,874.95 as deficiency estate and inheritance taxes including surcharges,
interests and compromise penalties."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then elevated to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was no dispute between the parties
regarding the values of the properties and the mathematical correctness of the
deficiency assessments, the principal question as noted dealt with the recipro­city
aspect as well as the insistence by the Collector of Internal Revenue that
Tangier was not a foreign country within the meaning of Section 122.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In ruling against the contention of the
Collector of Internal Revenue, the appealed decision states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In fine, we believe, and so hold, that
the expression 'foreign country', used in the last proviso of Section 122 of
the National Internal Revenue Code, refers to a government of that foreign
power which, although not an international person in the sense of international
law, does not impose transfer or death taxes upon intangible personal properties
of our citizens not residing therein, or whose law allows a similar exemption
from such taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, not
necessary that Tangier should have been recognized by our Government in order
to entitle the petitioner to the exemption benefits of the last proviso of
Section 122 of our Tax Code."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal to this Court by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respective briefs of the parties were
duly submitted, but as above indicated, instead of ruling definitely on the
question, this Court, on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1962</st1:date>,
resolved to inquire further into the question of reciprocity and sent back the
case to the Court of Tax Appeals for the reception of evidence thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of such resolution reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"While section 122 of the Philippine Tax Code <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
speaks of 'intangible personal property' in both sub­divisions (a) and (b); the
alleged laws of Tangier refer to '<span class="SpellE">bienes</span> <span class="SpellE">muebles</span> <span class="SpellE">situados</span> en <span class="SpellE">Tanger</span>', '<span class="SpellE">bienes</span> <span class="SpellE">muebles</span> <span class="SpellE">radicantes</span> en <span class="SpellE">Tanger</span>', 'movables' and 'movable property'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order that this Court may be able to
determine whether the alleged laws of Tangier grant the reciprocal tax
exemptions required by Section 122 of the Tax Code, and without, for the time
being, going into the merits of the issues raised by the petitioner-appellant,
the case is [remanded] to the Court of Tax Appeals for the reception of
evidence or proofs on whether or not the words '<span class="SpellE">bienes</span>
<span class="SpellE">muebles</span>', 'movables' and 'movable property' as used
in the Tangier laws, include or embrace 'intangible personal property', as used
in the Tax Code."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In line with the above resolution, the Court of Tax Appeals admitted evidence
submitted by the administrator, petitioner Antonio Campos <span class="SpellE">Rueda</span>,
consisting of exhibits of laws of Tangier to the effect that "the
transfers by reason of death of movable properties, corporeal or incorporeal,
including furniture and personal effects, as well as of securities, bonds,
shares, * * *, were not subject, on that date and in said zone, to the payment
of any death tax, whatever might have been the nationality of the deceased or
his heirs and legatees." It was further noted in an order of such Court
referring the matter back to us that such "exhibits were duly admitted in
evidence during the hearing of the case on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent presented no evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The controlling legal provision as noted is a proviso in Section
122 of the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That no tax
shall be collected under this Title in respect of intangible personal property
(a) if the decedent at the time of his death was a resident of a foreign
country which at the time of his death did not impose a transfer tax or death
tax of any character in respect of intangible personal property of citizens of
the Philippines not residing in that foreign country, or (b) if the laws of the
foreign country of which the decedent was a resident at the time of his death
allow a similar exemption from transfer taxes or death taxes of every character
in respect of intangible personal property owned by citizens of the Philippines
not residing in that foreign country."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The only obstacle therefore to a definitive ruling is whether or not as
vigorously insisted upon by petitioner the acquisition of international person­ality
is a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u> to Tangier being considered a
"foreign country." Deference to the De Lara ruling, as was made clear
in the opening paragraph of this opinion, calls for an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not admit of doubt that if a foreign country is to be identified
with a state, it is required in line with Pound's formulation that it be a
politically organized sovereign community independent of outside control bound
by ties of nationhood, legally supreme with­in its territory, acting through a
government functioning under a regime of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It is thus a sovereign person with the people com­posing it viewed as an
organized corporate society under a government with the legal competence to
exact obedience to its commands.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been referred to as a body-politic organized by common consent for
mutual defense and mutual safety and to promote the general welfare.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Correctly has it been described by <span class="SpellE">Esmein</span> as
"the juridical personification of the nation."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This is to view it in the light of its historical development.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stress is on its being a nation, its
people occupying a definite territory, politically organized, exercising by
means of its government its sovereign will over the individuals within it and
maintaining its separate international person­ality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laski</span> could speak
of it then as a territorial society divided into government and subjects,
claiming within its allotted area a supremacy over all other institutions.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
McIver similarly would point to the power entrusted to its government to
maintain within its territory the conditions of a legal order and to enter into
inter­national relations.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
With the latter requisite satisfied, inter­national law does not exact
independence as a condition of statehood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So Hyde did opine.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the assumption then that Tangier is bereft of
international personality petitioner has not successfully made out a case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears repeating that four days after the
filing of this petition on January 6, 1958 in Collector of Internal Revenue v.
De Lara,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
it was specifically held by us:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Considering the State of California as a foreign country in
relation to section 122 of our Tax Code we believe and hold, as did the Tax
Court, that the <span class="SpellE">Ancilliary</span> Administrator is entitled
to exemption from the inheritance tax on the intangible personal property found
in the Philippines."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
There can be no doubt that <st1:state><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:state>
as a state in the American Union was lacking in the alleged requisite of
international personality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
it was held to be a foreign country within the meaning of Section 122 of the
National Internal Revenue Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What is undeniable is that even prior to the De Lara ruling, this
Court did commit itself to the doctrine that even a tiny principality, that of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Liechtenstein</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
hardly an international person­ality in the traditional sense, did fall under
this exempt category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it appears in
an opinion of the Court by the then Acting Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>,
who thereafter assumed that position in a permanent capacity, in <span class="SpellE">Kiene</span> v. Collector of Internal Revenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
As was therein noted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Board
found from the documents submitted to it - proof of the laws of Liechtenstein -
that said country does not impose estate, inheritance and gift taxes on
intangible personal property of Filipino citizens not residing in that country.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, the Board declared that
pursuant to the exemption above established, no estate or inheritance taxes
were collectible, Ludwig <span class="SpellE">Kiene</span> being a resident of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Liechtenstein</st1:place></st1:country-region>
when he passed away."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came this definitive ruling:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The Collector - hereafter named respondent - cites decisions of
the United States Supreme Court and of this Court, holding that intangible
personal property in the Philippines belonging to a non­resident foreigner, who
died outside of this country is subject to the estate tax, in disregard of the
principle '<span class="SpellE">mobilia</span> <span class="SpellE">sequuntur</span>
<span class="SpellE">personam</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such property is admittedly taxable here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without the proviso above quoted, the shares
of stock owned here by the Ludwig <span class="SpellE">Kiene</span> would be
concededly subject to estate and inheritance taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless our Congress chose to make an
exemption where conditions are such that demand reciprocity - as in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the exemption must be
honored.”<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

In the subsequent case of Collector of Internal Revenue<i> v.</i> Fisher, L-11622,
January 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 93, this Court did find that the recipro­city found in
the California statutes was <u>partial</u> not <u>total</u>, thus holding that
Section 122 would not apply, without however reversing the doctrine that an
international personality is not a requisite.</p>
