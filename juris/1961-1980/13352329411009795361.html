				<H3>ROSARIO G. GALILA AND JOSEFA G. VALLEJO, COMPLAINANTS, VS. MUNICIPAL JUDGE SERAFIN VILLANUEVA OF JORDAN, SUB-PROVINCE OF GUIMARAS, ILOILO, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ANTONIO, <I>J</I>.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondent Judge is charged with:<br>
<br>
1. Abuse of authority for issuing warrants of arrest against the accused
 without first conducting a thorough examination of the witnesses for 
the prosecution as shown by his failure to subpoena the barrio captain 
who could testify that the accused took only two cavans of palay and not
 fifteen cavans as alleged in the criminal complaint; and<br>
<br>
2. Ignorance of the law for fixing excessive bail bonds, for imposing a 
penalty not within the range prescribed by law, and for committing the 
said accused upon conviction to the municipal jail instead of the 
provincial jail.<br>
<br>
On July 6, 1970, complainants executed a joint affidavit explaining that
 their complaint against respondent was prepared by Atty. Nicanor 
Sorongon of Iloilo City and that they were made to sign the same without
 any explanation from the said lawyer and that they believed that their 
complaint was against Florentino Magalona who accused their sons. As a 
consequence of the withdrawal by the complainants of their charges, 
Executive District Judge Egmedio V. Nietes of the Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo did not conduct a formal investigation but confined 
himself to an examination of the records of the cases involved, as 
everything that concerns the administrative charges could be verified 
from the records, and on the basis thereof considered respondent's 
explanantion satisfactory and recommended his exoneration.<br>
<br>
We have carefully reviewed the records of this case. As regards the 
first charge, respondent conducted the requisite preliminary examination
 through searching questions and answers as shown by the sworn 
statements of Florentino Magalona and Godofredo Ganancial (Annexes "1" 
and "2"). Having been convinced on the basis thereof of the existence of
 a probable cause for believing that the persons whose arrest was sought
 committed the crime charged, there was no necessity for respondent to 
subpoena other witnesses, as he considered the testimony of those 
presented already sufficient. As to the barrio captain, it appears that 
complainants wanted said official to testify on their affidavits 
admitting that they stole only two (2) sacks and not fifteen (15) sacks 
of palay. Respondent explained that he had no knowledge of the existence
 of those affidavits, and assuming that they existed they involve a 
matter of defense which could be presented by them during the trial of 
this case.<br>
<br>
As to the second charge, it also appears that the bail of P3,000.00 for 
each of the accused is not excessive, considering the imposable penalty 
for the crime of theft charged in the complaint, which is 
<i>prision correctional</i> in its minimum and medium 
periods (Art. 309, Revised Penal Code) and the provisions of Circular 
No. 47, dated July 5, 1946, and Circular No. 48 of July 18, 1963, of the
 Department of Justice. The reasonableness of the rates of bail 
recommended in the aforecited Department of Justice Circulars has 
previously received this Court's imprimatur in <i>Eda√±o v. 
Cea,</i> L-6821, May 10, 1954, and <i>Villasenor v. 
Abano</i>, L-23599, September 29, 1967. Finally, the record does 
not show that the accused were actually committed to the municipal jail.
 Upon the other hand, respondent's letter of October 13, 1969 (Annex 
"3") indicates that said accused were sent to the provincial warden for 
commitment to the provincial jail.<br>
<br>
<b>WHEREFORE,</b> the aforecited charges against respondent 
are hereby dismissed and he is hereby authorized to receive the 
retirement benefits and the money value of accumulated and unused 
vacation and sick leaves due to him.<br>
<br><br>
<i>Makalintal, Acting C.J., Ruiz Castro, Fernando Teehankee, 
Barredo, Makasiar, </i>and <i>Esguerra, JJ.,</i> 
concur,<br>
<i>Zaldivar, J.,</i> is on leave.<br>
