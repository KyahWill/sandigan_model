				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ADELAIDO RAMOS,
ALIAS BAYOT, ACCUSED WHOSE DEATH SENTENCE IS
UNDER AUTOMATIC REVIEW.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in
its decision of <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1971</st1:date>
convicted <span class="SpellE">Adelaido</span> Ramos of rape with murder,
sentenced him to death and ordered him to pay the heirs of Leonora <span class="SpellE">Sipalay</span> an indemnity of twelve thousand pesos (Criminal
Case No. 417).</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction was based on his plea of guilty,
extrajudicial confession and testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
elevated to this Court for review <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of August 17, 1971, Ramos, an illiterate
twenty-two-year old farmer, married with three children, slept in the house of
his first cousin, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Sipalay</span>, located at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Capilla</span> (<span class="SpellE">Consaguibo</span>), Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tigbawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tabuelan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos, who hailed from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
was temporarily residing with his family at <span class="SpellE">Camotehan</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villahermosa</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="GramE">a</span> barrio near <span class="SpellE">Tigbawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos went to Rogelio's house ostensibly to
get the chicken which the latter had promised to give him.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around six-thirty in the morning of the following day, August
18, Rogelio invited Ramos to take a bath at the well near the house of his
father, Juan <span class="SpellE">Sipalay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the two had walked some distance, Ramos told Rogelio that he was
going to return to the latter's house because he <span class="GramE">had</span>
allegedly forgotten his comb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio
told him to hurry so that they could take a bath together.</p>

<p class="BODY">On arriving at Rogelio's house, Ramos revealed to Leonora <span class="SpellE">Estañero</span>, the wife of Rogelio, that the latter was robbed
of his cow and that he (Ramos) had eluded the robbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That fictitious tale scared Leonora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told Ramos not to leave her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked her to give him Rogelio's pistol so
that he could defend her in case the robbers would come to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She complied with his request.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the suggestion of Ramos, Leonora and her two children left the
house and took refuge on the top of a hill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Leonora carried the baby, <span class="SpellE">Ronabeth</span>, one year
and three months old, while Ramos carried the older one, <span class="SpellE">Gerlito</span>,
four years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After being ensconced in
that secluded area, Ramos, who had courted Leonora when she was still
unmarried, reminded her of their past romance and proposed to have sexual
congress with her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Leonora, who was four months pregnant, refused to have any
criminal conversation with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
point, there is some discrepancy in the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the confession of Ramos and his testimony at the
preliminary investigation, he succeeded in raping Leonora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pleaded guilty to the information for
consummated rape with murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal health officer speculated that "there is a
possibility of consummated rape because of forcible tearing of the panty and
the whitish substance or specimen sent to the laboratory for analysis" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, when Ramos testified after arraignment, he declared on
direct examination that he did not have carnal intercourse with Leonora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, when he was confronted
with his extrajudicial confession that he raped her, he conceded that he
"attempted to rape her" and that he was not able to consummate the
rape (16 and 20 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the rape or attempted rape, Leonora slapped him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She shouted for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid discovery, Ramos killed her and her
two children with his bolo (<span class="SpellE"><u>sundang</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cut the ear lobe of Nora, took her
earrings and placed them inside his wallet.</p>

<p class="BODY">He went to his home at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Camotehan</span> and apprised his wife, Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>, that he had killed Leonora and her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked his wife to escape with him because
he expected that the police would arrest him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As she was in failing health, she reluctantly went with him to hide in
an uncultivated area (<span class="SpellE"><u>libon</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The police, accompanied by Miguel <span class="SpellE">Canciran</span>,
Ramos' brother-in-law, discovered the hiding place but Ramos was able to
escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was arrested later at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Ilihan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tabogon</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cebu</span></span></st1:place> on his way to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy disclosed that the lobule of Leonora's left ear was
cut; that her neck was almost severed from her body, leaving only two
millimeters of skin; that she sustained a circular wound on her left shoulder,
and that she had wounds on the fingers, an indication that she tried to parry
the bolo thrusts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her uterus was
enlarged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gerlito</span> sustained a fourteen-centimeter
incised wound in the skull.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had also
a wound in the mastoid region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His neck
was almost severed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ronabeth</span>
had an incised wound in the neck which left only a small portion of skin in the
neck before it would be completely separated from the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evi­dently, Ramos in a murderous frenzy
intended to behead his three victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The chief of police charged Ramos in the municipal court with
robbery, multiple murder and rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
robbery was based on the statement of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Sipalay</span>
that, on returning home, he discovered that the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,200</span>
which he was keeping inside the <span class="SpellE"><u>loka-loka</u></span> was
missing and that the coins deposited in the piggy bank (<span class="SpellE"><u>puyo-puyo</u></span>)
were also missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from Rogelio's statement and the extrajudicial confession
of Ramos, the police took the statements of Ramos’ wife and his brother-in-law,
<span class="SpellE">Canciran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
district state prosecutor filed <span class="GramE">an information</span> for
rape with murder with the aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident
premeditation, abuse of superior strength, uninhabited place, "disrespect
to sex" and deliberately augmenting and causing other wrongs not neces­sary
for the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the killing of the children, <span class="SpellE">Gerlito</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ronabeth</span>, two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
for murder were filed against Ramos (Criminal Cases Nos. 418 and 419).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetuas</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment, Ramos was assisted by three counsels <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>, one for each of the three cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case for rape with murder, his
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> manifested that after
conferring with Ramos, the latter informed his counsel that he was willing to
plead guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the information was
read to Ramos in the <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> dialect, he pleaded
guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court asked him whether he understood the meaning of
his plea of guilty, whether he admitted all the material allegations of the
information, and whether he was aware of the gravity of the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave a "yes" answer to those
questions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, the trial judge informed Ramos that death would be the
penalty imposable on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was asked
whether he still wanted to plead guilty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He answered yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the same
question was repeated, he answered: "That is up to the Honorable Judge."</p>

<p class="BODY">After that dialogue, Ramos was placed on the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, he testified that he
committed only attempted rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted having hacked to death Leonora and her children under the
circumstances already narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal presented in evidence the bolo used by Ramos, his
wallet containing the pair of earrings, his bloodstained polo shirt and pants,
his extrajudicial confession, the necropsy report and the death certificate for
Leonora <span class="SpellE">Estañero-Sipalay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, proceeding on the assumption that Ramos had
consummated the rape, convicted him of rape with murder aggravated by abuse of
superiority, disregard of sex, <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span> and
cruelty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appreciated the mitigating
circumstance of plea of guilty which offset only one of the four aggravating
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the death penalty
was imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this automatic review of the trial court's decision, counsel <u>de
<span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u> contends that Ramos' plea of guilty was
not an admission that he committed rape with murder and that the trial court
erred in holding that Ramos was guilty of that complex offense beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel insinuated
that Ramos made an improvident plea and that, since he denied having
consummated the rape, there should have been a full-dress trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that even if the crime committed by Ramos is categorized
as attempted rape with homicide, death is still the penalty that should be
meted to him under the penultimate paragraph of article 335 of the Revised
Penal Code, as amended by Republic Acts Nos. 2632 and 4111.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appreciation in his favor of the extenuating circumstance of
voluntary confession of guilt would not alter the result because when the Code
prescribes a single indivisible penalty like death, it is imposable regardless
of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the
commission of the crime (Art. 63, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as Ramos in his testimony admitted having committed at
least attempted rape with homicide (which being used in a generic sense includes
murder), it cannot be justifiably argued that he had made an improvident plea
of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">He is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempted rape with
homicide, an offense included in the charge of rape with murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot complain that he was not duly informed
of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Craft and fraud (<span class="SpellE"><u>astucia</u></span><u> y <span class="SpellE">fraude</span></u>), <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span>,
abuse of superiority and cruelty aggravated that special complex crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery, evident premeditation and
disregard of sex, which were alleged in the information, are not aggravating.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although no offended party filed a complaint against Ramos, we
hold that, like robbery with rape, rape with homicide or attempted or
frustrated rape with homicide can be prosecuted <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the ruling in People vs. Yu, 110
Phil. 793, 797.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ramos, in entering a plea of guilty with the knowledge that he
would be sentenced to death, realized the horrendousness or monstrosity of his
crimes which included abortion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
of his fiendish and atrocious misdeeds, the full weight of retributive justice
should be brought to bear upon him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed
with the modification that the designation of the special complex crime
committed by the accused should be attempted rape with homicide and not rape
with murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</span></p>
