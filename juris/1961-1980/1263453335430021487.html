				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner instituted on September 16, 1970 this <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition proceeding against respondent Judge Antonio D. Cinco who assumed jurisdiction over an action for annulment of two collective bargaining contracts filed by respondent Free Workers Association, after a strike had been declared and picket lines established against the employer, likewise charged with an unfair labor practice then pending in the Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; There was a motion to dismiss filed by petitioner Labor Union on the ground that it is the now-defunct Court of Industrial Relations that had exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.&nbsp; It was, however, denied by respondent Judge.&nbsp; Hence this suit for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.&nbsp; Thereafter, on September 21, 1970 this Court issued the following resolution:&nbsp; "L-32534 (<i>Associated Labor Union-AFL-VIMCONTU vs. Hon. Judge Antonio D. Cinco, et al.</i>) — The respondents are required to file an answer to the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary injunction within 10 days from notice hereof, and not to move to dismiss the petition.&nbsp; Upon petitioner's posting a bond of one thousand pesos (P1,000.00), let preliminary injunction issue."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Respondent Union filed the answer with the submission that since what was involved was the annulment of a collective bargaining contract, an ordinary court had competence to act.&nbsp; This Court duly scheduled for hearing or oral argument this petition on February 15, 1971, but on said date, neither party appeared.<br><br>Thereafter, on February 14, 1973, there was a motion to dismiss the petition filed by petitioner, worded as follows:&nbsp; "[Comes now] the petitioner through undersigned counsel, to this Honorable Court most respectfully moves for the dismissal of the above-entitled petition on the following ground:&nbsp; That the petition has become moot and academic — The purpose for which the above-entitled petition was filed was to enjoin respondent Judge Antonio D. Cinco or any one taking his place from proceeding with Civil Case No. R-11721 of the Court of First Instance of Cebu entitled, <i>'Free Workers Association vs. Associated Labor Union, et al.; </i>That the said civil case had already been dismissed at the instance of the parties, hence the above-entitled petition has become moot and academic * * * [Wherefore], premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that the above-entitled petition be dismissed without pronouncement as to costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Attached was "the order of respondent Judge Antonio D. Cinco, which reads thus:&nbsp; "Submitted for resolution are two motions.&nbsp; One is a joint motion of the parties asking for a dismissal of the complaint, cross-claim and counter-claim of the defendants.&nbsp; The other motion is a motion for dismissal by the plaintiff.&nbsp; Both motions have for their purpose the dismissal of this case on the ground stated therein.&nbsp; Both motions being tenable, the Court accedes and orders the dismissal of the complaint as well as the cross-claim and counterclaims filed by the defendant Vergara and Associated Labor Union.&nbsp; Without costs.&nbsp; [So ordered].&nbsp; Given in open court this 19th day of January, 1973, at Cebu City, Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The comment of respondent Labor Union was sought as early as the resolution of February 19, 1973, but it was not forthcoming.&nbsp; It thus appears clearly that nothing stands in the way of granting the aforesaid motion to dismiss the petition.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary injunction is dismissed for being moot and academic.&nbsp; The preliminary injunction issued in the resolution of September 21, 1970 is declared <i>functus oficio.</i><br><br><i>Makalintal, C.J., Barredo, Aquino,</i> and <i>Martin, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Antonio</i> and <i>Concepcion, Jr., JJ.,</i> are on official leave.<br><br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Resolution dated September 21, 1970.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Motion to Dismiss Petition, 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Order of Respondent Judge dated January 19, 1973.</div>
