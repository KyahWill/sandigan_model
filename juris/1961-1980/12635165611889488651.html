				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Original petition for
prohibition with preliminary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting upon written
complaints, some of them under oath, </span>of residents of <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, charging
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span> Valencia, as municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span>, with alleged abandonment of duties as such
officer, discrimination and grave abuse of discretion, and misconduct and
dishonesty, on January 31, 1966, the Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Carmeling</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, suspended Valencia as such mayor,
"effective at the start of office hours, February <span style="">1, </span>1966.” Thereupon, Valencia commenced the present action of
prohibition, with preliminary injunction, against Governor <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>,
Gonzalo P. <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, as Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span>,
and the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to nullify
said order of suspension; (2) to restrain Governor <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Crisologo</span></span><span style=""> from enforcing said order; (3) to restrain
Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> from discharging the duties and
functions of mayor of <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span>; and (4) to restrain
the provincial board from con­ducting an investigation of the administrative
charges contained in said complaints.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon after the filing of the petition herein, petitioner reiterated the
prayer therein for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, but the
same was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, notwithstanding,
the provincial board had voluntarily desisted from proceeding with the
investigation above referred to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, respondents filed their answer, admitting some
allegations of the petition, denying other allegations thereof and setting up
special defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents, likewise,
alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that, soon after
Governor <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> had received the complaints
aforementioned, or on January 28, 1966, she preferred the corresponding charges
against the pe<span style="">titioner in an
administrative complaint filed by her with the provincial board, copy of which
administrative complaint was attached to said answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner maintains that
the order for his suspension is null and void, it having been issued by
respondent Governor on the basis of a letter complaint of Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, in violation of the provisions of section 2188 of the
Revised <span style="">Adminis</span>trative Code,
pursuant to which the Governor must submit written charges to the provincial
board before issuing said order of suspension, and, that, the provincial board
can not legally give due course to and investigate said complaint because it
would then be acting without jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows, however,
that the charges contained in the complaint of Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>
and those made in other complaints of residents of <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span>
were incorporated into said administrative complaint filed by Governor <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> with the provincial board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further maintains that he had neither abandoned his
duties nor discriminated or committed a grave abuse of discretion; that the
charge for alleged misconduct and dishonesty is legally untenable, there being
no final judgment convicting him of the crime of embezzlement, on which the
charge is predicated; and that the charges against him do not affect his
official integrity.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that petitioner had held the office of mayor
of <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span> in consequence of his election to said of<span style="">fice on November 12, 1963; that his term of
office has expired on December 31, 1967; and that, at the general elections
held </span><span style="">on November 14, 1967,
former Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> was proclaimed elected mayor
of <span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span>, which office he now holds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the petition herein has for its purpose to prevent
petitioner's suspension as mayor of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tagudin</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
and the investigation by the provincial board of the charges preferred against
him as such mayor, the issues raised in the present case have thus become moot.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>
