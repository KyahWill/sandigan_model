attorney's fees — P5,000.00; actual damages — P1,000.00; moral damages — P2,000.00; exemplary damages — P1,000.00; and fees for expert witness — P500.00.&nbsp; As thus modified, the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all other respects, without pronouncement as to costs."<br></blockquote>Indeed, as aptly pointed out by petitioners it is evident that whereas the appellate court found as a fact that the damages suffered by petitioners amounted to P1,000 yearly since 1955, the dispositive portion of its decision simply says P1,000, without any qualification, which, of course, is a manifest ambiguity, if not inconsistency, that leaves the parties at a loss as to what exactly should be the amount of actual damages recoverable by petitioners.&nbsp; Considering, however, the tenor of the opinion and the ratiocination in the decision in question, there can hardly be any doubt that it was the intention of the appellate court to allow the recovery of the yearly damages it found to have been suffered by petitioners.&nbsp; If it went as far as to award attorney's fees of P5,000, moral damages of P2,000, exemplary damages of P1,000 and even fees for experts of P500, it stands to reason that it could not have meant to award petitioners actual damages of only P1,000.&nbsp; The absurdity of such a meager judgment of actual damages in the face of the other special items of damages awarded is too plain to be ignored.&nbsp; In fact, had the judgment of the Court of Appeals been allowed to become final and the problem now besetting petitioners were to be raised as an incident in the execution thereof, the chances are that a construction of said judgment in the manner above-stated might be sanctionable notwithstanding jurisprudence to the effect that it is the dispositive part of a decision that controls irrespective of what might appear in the opinion part thereof, for the simple reason that in this particular subject judgment, the inevitable conclusion from the findings of fact in the opinion of the Court of Appeals is so indubitable that any argument to the contrary would appear flimsy and purely technical, apart from being totally illogical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> We have no doubt that any other view would precisely be the kind of reasoning that might convince the people that our courts sometimes sacrifice substantial justice in the altar of technicalities.&nbsp; What is cause for wonder to Us in this case, however, is why such a simple matter had to reach the Supreme Court.&nbsp; It is almost certain that a brief motion for reconsideration calling the appellate court's attention could have made the instant proceeding unnecessary.&nbsp; Or respondent could have readily yielded to petitioners' pose, considering the manifest correctness thereof.&nbsp; Be that as it may.&nbsp; We must admit that delays in the administration of justice could be considerably avoided if greater care were taken in the drafting of the dispositive portions of decisions which in truth constitute the very essence thereof.<br><br>Petitioners also assign as error the failure of the Court of Appeals to sentence defendants to pay them interests and costs.&nbsp; Again, We find merit in this contention.&nbsp; They are entitled to interest at the legal rate from the date of the judgment of the trial court.&nbsp; (Section 8, Rule 51, Article 2213, Civil Code of the Philippines.) And to costs.&nbsp; (Section 1, Rule 142).<br><br>Anent the claim of petitioners that they are entitled to corresponding adjustment of the amounts granted to them as a result of the rise in the rate of dollar exchange of the peso.&nbsp; We are of the considered opinion that the facts extant in the record do not provide sufficient legal basis thereof.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed with the modification that the amount of actual damages awarded petitioners should be P1,000 annually from 1955 and the respondents shall pay interest on all the amounts adjudged against them at the legal rate from the date of the judgment of the trial court.&nbsp; Costs in all instances against respondents.<br><br><i>Zaldivar, (Chairman), Fernando, Antonio, Fernandez,</i> and <i>Aquino, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See, Filipino Legion Corporation <i>vs.</i> CA and Lentija, et al., L-22364, and Lentija, et al <i>vs.</i> Filipino Legion Corporation, L-28330, decided jointly on April 30, 1974.<br></div>
