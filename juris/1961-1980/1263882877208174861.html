Bureau Inc.".</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, Teresita Villapania, in her behalf and in
behalf of her minor children, Emilio, Enrique, Ernesto, Elias, Orlando and
Jesus, all surnamed Bautista, filed a compensation claim against Northern
Motors, Inc., (hereinafter called NMI for short) and Detective &amp; Protective
Bureau, Inc. (hereinafter called DPBI for short) for the accidental death on
July 13, 1965 of her husband, Emilio S. Bautista, an employee of the respondent
DPBI but assigned as watchman of the respondent, NMI, before the Workmen's
Compensation Unit, Regional Office No. 4; that respondent DPBI submitted its
employer's report admitting that the deceased Emilio S. Bautista was its
employee and was injured in regular occupation and signified its intention to
controvert the claim but without stating any ground or reason for such controversion;
that the other respondent, NMI, did not controvert the claim; that in their
contract, the DPBI assumed all responsibility for the proper performance of the
duties of all the security guards and agreed <span style="">to hold NMI free from any liability under the Workmen's Compensation
Act; that the DPBI executed a bond in favor of the NMI in the amount of
P10,000.00 to secure full performance by DPBI of its obligations under the
contract; that the Acting Referee of Region 4 rendered an award the dispositive
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Northern Motors, Inc. and Detec­tive &amp; Protective Bureau, Inc., are ordered

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE AGENCY hereby assumes and undertakes any
and all responsibilities for the proper performance of the duties of all the
security guards fur­nished by it; THE AGENCY fur­ther holds and binds itself to
answer for all losses and da­mages, which through any commission of acts or
omission of duties by such security guards, may be the cause or reason of the
losses and damages to THE COMPANY; and by way of guarantee for this ob­ligation,
THE AGENCY hereby fur­nishes a Surety Bond of TEN THOU­SAND PESOS,
(P10,000.00), Philip­pine Currency, payable to THE COM­PANY herein above
mentioned.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said guards shall be directly hired by THE AGENCY, and this contract of
employment shall not be between THE COMPANY and any of the guards hired or
taken by THE AGENCY, but merely as a con­tract covering conditions of
employment of THE AGENCY, it being clearly understood and agreed upon that this
contract is solely between THE COMPANY and THE AGENCY.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE
AGENCY hereby under­takes to pay the wages of said security guards in
accordance with the provisions of the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 60-2)
and of the rules and regulations issued by the Wage Administration Service
implementing the same, assuming all responsibilities therefor.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(f)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE
AGENCY also agrees to hold THE COMPANY free from any liability, cause or causes
of action, claim or claims, which may be filed by any of its secu­rity guards
by reason of their employment under this contract or under the provisions of
the Mini­num Wage Law, Workmen's Compensa­tion Act, Employer's Liability Act,
Eight Hour Labor Law, and any other law or laws which are now in effect or
which may hereafter be enacted."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The applicable provision of the Workmen's Compen­sation Act is
Sec. 39 (a) which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>'Employer'
includes every person or association of persons, incorporated or not, public or
private, and the legal represen­tative of the deceased employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It includes the owner or lessee of a factory
or establishment or place of work or any other person who is virtually the
owner or manager of the business car­ried on in the establishment or place of
work but who, for the reason that there is an indepen­dent contractor in the
same, or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of laborers employed
there."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court, in a case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> with facts similar to the facts in the case
at bar, ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that 'the main business of the peti­tioner
is the milling and manu­facture of various corn products,' while the security
guards were furnished by the Interna­tional Watchman Agency to guard and
protect the petitioner's warehouses, materials, machine­ries, and
buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifi­cally, Hearing
Referee made the following findings regarding the nature of work performed by
the deceased Ricardo Ramos:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'As such
security guard, the deceased's work consisted in guarding the premises of the
respondent company, conducting inspections on outgoing and incoming trucks and
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the performance of his
work as such security guard, he was closely under the super­vision of the
proper authorities of the respondent company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The security guards were not provided with arms by respon­dent company;
they, however, were provided with patches on their uniforms bearing the em­blem
of the company as well as that of the security agen­cy.' Furthermore, the
respondent Commission found that the petitioner 'indispensably needed the
services of the security guards, x x x to protect its business interest.' Under
the foregoing circums­tances, it is evident that the work of the deceased was
part of the usual business of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequent­ly, even if the petitioner was not the direct employer of the
deceased Ricardo Ramos in view of the intervention of an independent contractor,
it was still the statutory employer and therefore liable for the compensation
claimed." (Ibid., pp. 54-55)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the recent case of
Aboitiz Co., Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, et al.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court reiterated the statutory employer
liability of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the company furnished with security guards by
the agency as independent contractor but upheld the terms embodied in their
contract of service whereby the company, upon payment of the award to the
claimant, has the right of reimbursement from the agency by virtue of such
contract of security guard service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent portion of the decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner has valid cause for complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under its contract <span style="">for </span>security guard service with respondent security agency, the
latter had expressly assumed sole respon­sibility for all liabilities under the
labor laws includ­ing the Workmen's Compensa­tion Act that may be claimed by
the guard, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">'h) The AGENCY shall
solely assume all res­ponsibilities and liabi­lities for any claim or demand by
or against the guard arising under all Philippine Labor Laws, including
overtime pay, extra compensation on Sun­<span style="">days
</span>and legal holidays, liability under the Work­men's Compensation Act,
Social Security Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x.'</p>

<blockquote>While petitioner was statutorily liable for the death compensation
for purposes of the Workmen's Compensation Act, still the security agency
should be held ultimately liable as the direct employer who employed and
furnished the security guard in pursuance of its business of providing business
establishments with the services of security guards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, as already indicated, the
security agency was contractual­ly liable to hold petitioner safe and harmless
from any such claims by virtue <span style="">of </span>the
agency's express contractual undertaking to assume sole and ultimate liability
therefor."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the present case, the
DPBI has agreed to hold the NMI free from any liability for claims under the
labor laws that may be filed by the security guards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision and resolution of the Work­men's
Compensation Commission sought to be reviewed are hereby affirmed with the
modification that the amounts to be paid shall be P6,000.00 as death
