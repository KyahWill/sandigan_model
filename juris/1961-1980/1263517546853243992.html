				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two cases are inextricably related to each other, hence are
being resolved jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April <span style="">5, 1966, </span>a
complaint was filed by Maria Luisa I. Vda. de Donato with the Court of Agrarian
Relations, Ba­colod Branch (CAR Case <span style="">No. </span>3236) against five of her agri­cultural
share-tenants, two of whom are herein petitioners<span style=""> Concepcion Moscoso and Gaudioso Cabrillos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her complaint the plaintiff averred that
the defendants disobeyed her law­ful orders in connection with the stacking of
the palay har</span><span style="">vests and exhibited
lack of loyalty and cooperation, and, with respect to defendants Moscoso and
Cabrillos, that they owed her 111 cavans and 90 cavans and </span><span style="">18 </span><span style="">gantas of palay, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was accordingly prayed that all five de­fendants be ordered ejected
from their landholdings, and that the two above-mentioned defendants be ordered
to de­liver to the plaintiff the quantities of palay that they owed her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A few months after the filing of the complaint, the parties
arrived at an amicable settlement, which was re­duced to writing and submitted
to the court for approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
terms of the settlement, such matters relative to the sharing basis in the
produce; the system of trans­planting to be adopted, and the parties'
respective con­tributions in the expenses, were agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last paragraph of the agreement reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That
by virtue of this amicable settlement, we hereby renounce and waive all our
claims and counterclaims against the other in connection with this case, having
reference to our existing tenancy relationship."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November <span style="">24, 1966, </span>the
court rendered judgment ap­proving the compromise agreement and adopting the
same as its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the same plaintiff in the CAR case (Mrs. Donato)
filed with the Municipal Court of Valladolid, Neg­ros Occidental, two actions
against two of the defendants in the case, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on February 2, <span style="">1967, </span>Civil Case No.102 against Concepcion Moscoso for the
collection of an indebt­edness of <span style="">94 </span>cavans
and 20-1/2 gantas of palay, or their al­leged equivalent worth in cash of
P1,517.00; and on December <span style="">14, </span><span style="">1967, </span>Civil Case No. 107 against
Gaudioso Cabrillos for the collection of an indebtedness of <span style="">97 </span>cavans and 14-1/2 gantas of palay,
or their alleged equivalent worth in cash <span style="">of
P2,146.76.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In each case the
plaintiff prayed for a writ of preliminary attachment, which writ was issued in
Civil Case No. 102 on November 2, <span style="">1967,
</span>upon the plaintiff's post­ing of <span style="">a </span>bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, or on February 25, <span style="">1967, </span>the CAR issued a resolution in Case No. 3238, in
connection with certain motions filed by the plaintiff therein, stating that
paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of the compromise
agreement quoted above was understood by the parties to mean that "[t]he
waiver of the claims and counterclaims of the parties, do not refer to any
indebtedness that anyone may have contracted with <span style="">the </span>other;" consequently, the
claims in relation to the al­leged indebtedness should be prosecuted in
separate actions for collection in the proper court, and not in the CAR, which
has no jurisdiction thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants in Civil Cases Nos. 102 and 107 then filed motions
to dismiss <span style="">on </span>the grounds that
in each case <span style="">(a)
</span><span style="">the cause of action is barred by
the judgment in CAR Case No. </span><span style="">3238,
</span><span style="">and/or the claim has been
waived, aban­doned or otherwise extinguished; and (b) the court has </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">jurisdiction over the subject because the alleged loans or advances
arose from agrarian relations, hence, juris­diction is vested in the CAR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motions to dismiss were denied on
September 13, 1967 and January </span><span style="">9,
1968, </span><span style="">respec­tively; so were the
defendants' motions for reconsidera­</span><span style="">tion </span><span style="">in an order dated
January 12, </span><span style="">1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On
January </span><span style="">29, </span><span style="">1968, the defendants filed separate answers
with counter­claims; defendant Moscoso (in Civil Case No. 102) denied being
indebted to the plaintiff, and defendant Cabrillos (in Civil Case No. 107)
likewise denied that he was in­debted to the plaintiff, and stating that even
on the as­sumption that he was indebted, only the CAR has jurisdic­tion to try
the case in view of the tenancy relationship between him and the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants Moscoso and Cabrillos then filed, on January <span style="">31, 1968, </span>a petition for certiorari
and prohibition, with prayer for preliminary injunction (Civil Case No. <span style="">8450) </span>with the Court of First Instance
of Negros Occidental, asking that court to declare that the Municipal Court of
Valladolid, pre­sided over by respondent Judge Lorenzo M. Quitco, is without
jurisdiction to try and decide Civil Cases Nos. 102 and <span style="">107, </span>and/or that the causes of action are barred by a prior judg­ment,
or that the claims or demands set forth in the com­plaints have been waived,
abandoned or otherwise extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
February <span style="">14, 1968, </span>Presiding
Judge Jose F. Fernandez of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental
issued an order restraining the municipal judge from acting on the cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February <span style="">26, 1968, </span>on motion filed by the private respondent in the
special civil action, Judge Fernandez issued an order directing the petitioners
Moscoso and Cabrillos to deposit in a bonded warehouse their palsy shares of
the produce from private respondent's land not otherwise exempt from execu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners moved for a reconsideration
of that order, but on March <span style="">3, 1968, </span>the
motion was denied, the court explaining that it had to issue the order in the
interest of justice and in order to preserve the ownership of the land­lord's
share, considering that the Municipal Court of Valla­dolid could not legally
take action on the case in view of <span style="">the </span>restraining
order previously issued against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the first time in relation to Civil Cases Nos. 102 <span style="">and </span>107, Moscoso and Cabrillos came to
this Court on March <span style="">21, </span>1968, on
a petition for certiorari with <span style="">a </span>prayer for preliminary injunction (G.R. Nos.
L-28851-52), asking this Court to restrain the respondents therein, Judge
Fernandez <span style="">and </span>Maria Luisa I.
Vda. de Donato, from proceeding with the enforcement of the February 28, 1968
order directing the petitioners to deposit their palay shares, and to nullify
the <span style="">said </span><span style="">Order for </span>want of jurisdiction on the
part of the <span style="">suing
</span><span style="">court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 28, </span><span style="">1968, </span><span style="">this Court denied
the pe­tition for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners moved to recon­sider, but their motion was denied on May </span><span style="">7, 1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 31, 1968, the Court of First Instance of Negros
Occidental rendered judgment in its Civil Case No. 8450 <span style="">dis­</span>missing the petition for certiorari and prohibition on the
ground that an order denying a motion to dismiss is interlo­cutory in nature,
hence, appeal in due time, not certiorari and prohibition, is the proper
remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for the reconsideration
of <span style="">the </span>decision was filed by the
petitioners, but the same was denied in the court's order of August 15, <span style="">1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the second time, Moscoso and Cabrillos came to this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September <span style="">6, 1968, </span>they filed the present
special civil action of certiorari and prohibition <span style="">(G.R. No. L-29486) </span>alleging that Judge Fernandez exceeded his
jurisdiction when in his July 31, <span style="">1968 </span>decision
he allowed respondent Municipal Judge Quitco to proceed with the trial and
determination of Civil Cases Nos. 102 and 107.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the petitioners, this will only result in waste of judicial
time and prejudice to them, considering that the causes of action are barred by
a prior judgment, etc., and that the Municipal Court of Valla­dolid has no
jurisdiction over the subject of the actions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners prayed this Court for a writ of preliminary injunction,
and, on the merits, to set aside the decision of respondent Judge Fernandez and
declare the inferior court without jurisdiction to try the cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 11, <span style="">1968, </span>this Court required the respondents to file an answer,
and, upon the posting of a bond by the petitioners, issued a writ of
preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time
respondent Donato filed her answer claiming that respondent Judge Fernandez was
correct in holding <span style="">that </span>certiorari
is not the proper remedy to nullify an order denying a motion to dismiss, be­cause
such an order being interlocutory in character, an appeal from the decision on
the merits at the proper time is the correct remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties filed their respective
memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the record of Civil Case No. <span style="">8450 </span>of the Court of First Instance of
Negros Occidental was forwarded to this Court due to the notice of appeal filed
by petitioners Moscoso and Cabrillos on September <span style="">3, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>For this reason,
<span style="">this </span>Court, in a resolution
dated February 17, 1969, directed that the same be given a separate folder and
number and re­quired the petitioners-appellants, who are litigating as paupers,
to file their briefs within the shortened period of twenty days and
respondents-appellees to file theirs within a like period, counted from their
receipt of copies of appellants' briefs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This case was docketed in this Court as G.R. No. <span style="">L-30248.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The parties have
submitted their respective briefs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, therefore, while G.R. <span style="">Nos.
L-29486 </span>and <span style="">L-30248 </span>have
been brought to this Court, on different modes, both of them refer to the same
subject matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issues before this Court are whether the Municipal
Court of Valladolid has jurisdiction to try and decide Civil Cases Nos. 102 and
107, and, assuming that it has, whether the actions are barred by the prior
judgment in CAR Case No. <span style="">3238.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners Moscoso and Cabrillos naturally take the negative
view on the first issue, and the affirmative view on the second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim that (a) under paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of the compromise agreement which
was approved by the CAR and incorporated in its decision, the parties agreed to
re­nounce and waive their respective claims and counterclaims against each
other, which necessarily include respondent Donato's claims for collection; and
(b) assuming that the petitioners are indebted to the said respondent, the
causes of action in Civil Cases Nos. 102 and 107 arose out of the special
relationship of landlord and tenant.</p>

<p class="BODY">To resolve the issues, it is necessary to quote again the
ultimate paragraph of the compromise agreement, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That
by virtue of this amicable settlement, we hereby renounce and waive all our
claims and counterclaims against the other in connection with this case, having
reference to our existing tenancy relationship."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Note the qualifying phrase "having
reference to our exist­ing tenancy relationship." The parties having used
the phrase in the paragraph in question, they must be under­stood to have
attached thereto a specific meaning and pur­pose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article <span style="">2036
</span>of the Civil Code provides that a com­promise "comprises only those
objects which are definitely stated therein, or which by necessary implication
from its terms should be deemed to have been included in the same."</p>

<p class="BODY">Our first duty, therefore, <span style="">is, </span>insofar as it is pos­sible, to ascertain
the objects comprised in the compro­mise agreement submitted to, and
subsequently approved by, the CAR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint in the CAR case is for both the ejectment of the defendants and the
collection of certain palay advances allegedly made by the plaintiff to some
of' them, particularly' to petitioners Moscoso and Cabrillos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no allegation therein that the
alleged advances were made in connection with the cultivation of the land­holdings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the defendants'
counterclaims are for a change in the sharing basis, for a re-liquidation of
the harvests for the <span style="">six </span>immediately preceding agricultu­ral
<span style="">years, </span>and,
with specific reference to petitioner Cab­rillos, for the accounting of
harvests for two agricultural years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff's demand for ejectment and the defend<span style="">ants' aforesaid counterclaims unquestionably stem from the agrarian
relations between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
have previously said, it does not appear from the complaint - neither does it
appear from the answer - whether the plaintiff's claims for indebtedness have
any relation to the cultivation of the land­holdings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the phrase "having
reference to our existing tenancy relationship" clearly applies to the
plain­tiff's demand for ejectment and to the defendants' counter­claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same, however, cannot be said of the
plaintiff's claims for collection of loan advances, because, we repeat, the
pleadings, particularly the complaint, furnish no suffi­cient and helpful clue
on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be that the
claims for collection arose from agrarian relations, for which reason they were
included by the plaintiff in her complaint with the CAR, in which case the
Municipal Court of Valladolid would have no jurisdiction over Civil Cases Nos.
102 and 107.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opposite, however,
could be true, and this precisely may <span style="">have
been </span>the object of the parties in including the above-<span style="">quoted phrase </span>in paragraph </span><span style="">8 </span><span style="">of the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">such event the </span>inferior court would
have jurisdiction over the <span style="">cases.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It thus becomes
imperative to </span><span style="">determine </span>whether the <span style="">plain­</span>tiff
<span style="">in Civil </span>Cases Nos. 102 and 107
really made loan advances to the defendants, as alleged by the plaintiff in her
complaints, and, if <span style="">she did, </span>whether
the <span style="">extension
</span>thereof was made in connection with the agrarian relations between the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span style="">matters can only </span>become known after the presentation of the evi­dence
during the trial on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Municipal Court of <span style="">Valladolid becomes </span>satisfied,
after evaluating the evidence that <span style="">will
be adduced </span>before it, that loan advances were made by the <span style="">plaintiff to </span>the defendants in
connection with their agrarian <span style="">relations,
then </span>it should decide the cases by dismissing them for <span style="">lack of </span>jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever action that court makes on <span style="">the cases on their merits </span>will, after
all, be appealable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">would be advisable, </span>therefore, should
the municipal court take pains to make of record in its judgment the pertinent <span style="">facts on </span>the <span style="">basis </span><span style="">of </span>which it has assumed jurisdiction, so that if the matter is
elevated to the court of first instance on appeal, the latter court, on the
basis thereof, can conduct the neces­sary preliminary hearing on the
question-of jurisdiction, which will thereby be considerably expedited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, in effect, was our ruling in Derecho
vs. Abiera, et al., L-26697, July <span style="">31,
1970, </span>where we said that when the factual question of existence of a
leasehold tenancy relation between the parties is raised, which if true, would
vest original and exclusive jurisdiction over the case in the court of agrarian
relations and not in the municipal court, it is essential for the court of
first instance to hold a preliminary hearing and receive evidence solely on the
facts that would show or disprove the <span style="">existence
</span>of the alleged lease­<span style="">hold </span><span style="">tenancy, </span>so
that said court could determine whether or not <span style="">it has jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, the Municipal Court of Valladolid denied the
motions to dismiss merely on the <span style="">basis </span>of
the opinion expressed in the February 25, <span style="">1967
</span>resolution of the CAR to the effect <span style="">that </span>the waiver of the claims and counterclaims did not refer to
any indebtedness that the parties might have contracted with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The November 24, 1966 decision of the CAR was
based on a <span style="">compromise agreement, hence,
it immediately became final and executory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The February 25, 1967 resolution could not, consequently, operate as a
modification or as an amendment of the </span>judgment, and, for that reason,
could not be controlling on the issues raised before the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter court should have deferred action
on the motions to dismiss, considering that on the basis of the complaint alone
it could not reasonably de­termine the question of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
petitioners appear to have taken cer</span>tain erroneous procedural
steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, when the
municipal court denied their motions to dismiss, they filed a pe­tition for
certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Negros
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly held by
respondent Judge Fernandez, the order of denial is interlocutory in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An order denying a motion to
dismiss may only be the subject of certiorari and prohibition where it <u><span style="">clearly</span></u><span style=""> </span>appears that the trial court is proceeding in excess or outside
of its jurisdiction (University of Santo Tomas vs. Villanueva, etc., et al.,
106 Phil., 439), which is not so in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, when respondent Judge
Fernandez dismissed the petition, the petitioners came to this Court on
certiorari and prohibition <span style="">(G.R. No.
L-29486).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proper remedy is appeal,
because, if at all, </span>error in judgment, not abuse of discretion amounting
to lack or excess of jurisdiction, was committed by Judge Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances the petition must
fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, however,
petitioners Moscoso and Cabrillos seasonably appealed from the judgment of the
Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, which is the reason why the
record of the case was forwarded to this Court (G.R. No. L-302481 For the
reason that the decision appealed from is correct, the appeal must likewise
fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending before this Court is a motion filed on April 7, 1970, by the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that
during the pendency of the certiorari and prohibition case in the Court of
First Instance of Negros Occidental, respondent Judge Fernandez, acting on a
motion filed by respondent Donato, issued an order on February 26, 1968,
directing the petitioners to deposit their palay shares in a bonded
warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners moved to re­consider,
but their motion was denied; so the palay shares were deposited as
ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their present motion the
petitioners question the legality of the order, and allege that "this is
now the second year that the said palay has been deposited and the possibility
cannot be escaped that the palay has rotted or in the process of rotting x x
x." They pray this Court to declare the said order illegal and void, and
to order the release of 70% of the net produce as their shares for the crop
year 1967-68 now depo­sited with the Guadalupe Rice Mill - 71 cavans and 20
gantas for petitioner Moscoso, and 102 cavans for petitioner Cab­rillos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Required to comment, the respondents allege
that the matter alluded to in the present motion was the subject of the
petition for certiorari filed with this Court on March 21, 1968 (G.R. Nos.
L-28851-52) which was dismissed <span style="">for </span>lack <span style="">of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation of
respondents is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are, however,
prone to grant the motion for the release of the petitioners' shares on account
of the time element which now deserves primary consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel that the risk of destruction of the
palay in question will become much greater because it will take some, more time
- the duration of which </span>is wholly uncertain and indeterminable -before
the cases in the Municipal Court of Valladolid are finally decided and the
decision therein becomes final and executory, what with the appeals which the
losing party may reasonably be expected to interpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyhow, assuming that the petition­ers
eventually lose in the cases, the corresponding writs of execution will be
issued against them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for certiorari and prohibition in
G.R. No. L-29486 is denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by
this Court is ordered dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judgment appealed from in G.R. No. L-30248 is affirmed, with the modification -
insofar as the February 26, 1968 Order is concerned - that the palay shares of
the petitioners-appellants now deposited with the Guadalupe Rice Mill are
hereby ordered released to them upon filing of a bond in the amount of P100.00
for petitioner Moscoso and P<span style="">150.00 </span>for
petitioner Cabrillos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
