upon motion of herein petitioner, <span class="GramE">We</span> issued a writ, of

<blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, until further orders from this Court, You

and You (respondent <span style="">Hon. </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Martinez) are hereby
restrained from taking and conducting any further proceedings in Case No.
81-IPA <span style="">of the </span><span style="">court </span><span style="">of Industrial Relations, entitled 'NPC Employees and Workers Association
versus National Power Corporation, respondent; National Power Corporation
Supervisorsâ€™ Union, <span class="SpellE">movant</span>', insofar a it involves
and/or affects herein petitioner."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">On
February 28, 1969 Carmen <span class="SpellE">Quilop</span> and others, through
Atty. Jimenez B. <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>, filed </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">a </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">motion praying for the issuance of an order clarifying whether or not
the above injunction applies to them, and if it does not, to authorize the
Court of Industrial Relations to proceed with hearings to determine the pay
that <span class="SpellE">movants</span> should receive in the light of Republic
Act No. 4657 (<span class="SpellE">Teves</span> Law) and the provisions of the
existing Collective Bargaining Agreement between the National Power Corporation
and the National Power Employees and Workers Association.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">It
appears that in connection with an agreement supplemental to the existing
collective bargaining agreement between the Corporation and the Association,
approved </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">by </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the Court of
Industrial Relations in its order of </span></span><st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="1"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">January
 </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">8, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1968</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, a petition was
filed on March 27 of said year to implement said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court; resolving said motion, ruled that
the </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">salary </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">or pay to be
received by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, considering the provisions
of Republic Act 4657 (<span class="SpellE">Teves</span> Law) and those of the
basic collective bargaining agreement "will be determined by the
Court" and, as a matter of fact, set the case for hearing in connection
therewith on November 26, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">This hearing, however, was not held in view
of the objection interposed by the National Power Corporation Employees and
Workers </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Association </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">who claimed that
the holding thereof would violate the writ of preliminary injunction issued by
us.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">In
connection with the motion under consideration, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">we </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">required the
interested parties to submit their comments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, through counsel, submitted its comments on March 18, 1969
saying, infect that as <span class="SpellE">movants</span> are not its members,
petitioner is not concerned in any proceedings below as long as they do not in </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">any </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">manner affect or
involve its rights and interests and those of its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its part, the National Power Corporation
Employees and Workers Association, through counsel, submitted its comments on
March 26, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1969 objecting to </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the holding of
the hearing until such time as the question of whether <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
are supervisors has been determined and suggesting that their remedy is to move
for a <span style="">reconsideration </span>of </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the court's order dated </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">February 27, 1969 holding </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">in </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">abeyance the proceedings in Case No. 81-IPA until after the Supreme
Court has dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction issued by it in this
case and/or the status of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> has </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">been finally </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">determined.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The
writ of preliminary injunction in question mainly </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">restrains the respondent </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">NPC from making deductions from the <span style="">salary </span>differentials and/or salary
increases of the supervisors of the NPC corresponding to 20% attorney's fees
payable to respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balcos</span>, and to this effect further restrained </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the respondent </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">judge from taking and conducting further
proceedings in Case No. 81-IPA in so far as it involves or affects herein
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">It is our view, therefore,</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> that hearings to
be held by the Court of Industrial Relations in relation to its order of
January </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">8, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1968, for the purpose of determining the pay
to be received by <span class="SpellE">movants</span>, and even for the purpose
of determining the question of whether or not they belong to the supervisors
class, will not violate the writ of preliminary injunction thus issued by this
Court, as long as no order is issued providing for deductions from the salary
differentials or increases of the supervisors of the NPC, </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">or granting </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">any relief adversely affecting petitioner
herein.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
