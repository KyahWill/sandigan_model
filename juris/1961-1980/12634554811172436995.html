<p class="BODY">Payments for said tax were made, under protest, by <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Company, Inc. on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1964</st1:date> for P7<span class="GramE">,087.50</span> and
on <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1964</st1:date> for
P5,000, or a total of P12,087.50.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 1, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Company,
Inc. filed be­fore the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
with service of a copy upon the Solicitor General, a complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
against the City of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> as well as its Treasurer,
Municipal Board and Mayor, alleging that the afore-stated ordinance is
unconstitutional for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the equal pro­tection
clause (Sec. 1 [1], Art. <span class="GramE">III, Constitution) and the rule of
uniformity of taxation (Sec. 22[1], Art, VI, Constitution), aside from being an
export tax forbidden under Section 2287 of the Revised Administrative Code.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further alleged that the tax is neither a
production nor a license tax which <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City under
Section 15-kk of its charter and under Section 2 of Republic Act 2264, other­wise
known as the Local Autonomy Act; is authorized to impose; and that the tax
amounts to a customs duty, fee or charge in violation of paragraph 1 of Section
2 of Repu­blic Act 2264 because the tax is on both the sale and export of
sugar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering, the defendants asserted that the tax or­dinance was
within defendant city's power to enact under the Local Autonomy Act and that
the same did not violate the afore-cited constitutional limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After pre?trial and submission of the
case on memoranda, the Court of First Instance, on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1964</st1:date>, rendered a decision that upheld the
constitutionality of the ordinance and de­clared the taxing power of defendant
chartered city broad­ened by the Local Autonomy Act to include all other forms
of taxes, licenses or fees not excluded in its charter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was directly taken to <span class="GramE">Us</span> by plain­tiff <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar
Company, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant alleges the same
statutory and constitutional violations in the afore­said taxing ordinance
mentioned earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of the ordinance states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There shall be paid to the City
Treasurer on any and all productions of centrifugal sugar milled at the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Company Incorporated in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
a municipal tax equivalent to one per centum (1%) per export sale to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States of America</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other foreign
countries." <span class="GramE">Though referred to as a "production
tax", the imposition actually amounts to a tax on the export of
centrifugal sugar produced at <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Company,
Inc.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For production of sugar
alone is not taxable; the only time the tax applies is when the sugar produced
is exported.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant questions the authority of the defendant Municipal
Board to levy such an export tax, in view of Section 2287 of the Revised
Administrative Code which de­nies from municipal councils the power to impose
an ex­port tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2287 in part
states:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It shall not be in the
power of the municipal council to impose a tax in any form whatever, upon goods
and merchandise carried in­to the municipality, or out of the same, and any
attempt to impose an import or export tax upon such, goods in the guise of an
unreasonable charge for <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>, use of brides or
otherwise, shall be void."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, Section 2 of Republic Act 2264, effective <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1959</st1:date>, gave chartered cities,
mu­nicipalities and municipal districts authority to levy for public purposes
just and uniform taxes, licenses or fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anent the inconsistency between Section 2287 of the Revised
Administrative Code and Section 2 of Republic Act 2264, this Court, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Nin</u></span><u> Bay Mining Co. v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
held the former to have been repealed by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And expressing <span class="GramE">Our</span>
awareness the transcendental effects that municipal export or import taxes or
licenses will have on the national economy, due to Section 2 of Republic Act
2264, We stated that there was no other alternative until Congress acts to
provide remedial mea­sures to forestall any unfavorable results.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point remains to be determined, however, whether
constitutional limits on the power of taxation, specifi­cally the equal
protection clause and rule of uniformity of taxation, were infringed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution in the bill of rights provides: "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> nor shall any person be
denied the equal protec­tion op the laws." <span class="GramE">(Sec. 1[1],
Art.</span> III) In <span class="SpellE"><u>Felwa</u></span><u> v. Salas</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
We ruled that the equal protection clause applies only to persons or things
identically situated and does not bar a reasonable classification of the
subject of le­gislation, and a classification is reasonable where (1) it is
based on substantial distinctions which make real differences; (2) these are
germane to the purpose of the law (3) the classification applies not only to
present conditions but also to future conditions which are substantially
identical to those of the present; (4) the classification applies only to those
who belong to the same class.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the requisites instantly shows that the questioned
ordinance does not meet them, for it taxes on­ly centrifugal sugar produced and
exported by the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Company, Inc. and none
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the taxing
ordinance's enactment, <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Company, Inc., it
is true, was the only sugar central in the city of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still the classification, to be reasonable,
should be in terms applicable to future conditions as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taxing ordinance should not be singular
and exclusive to exclude any subsequently established sugar central, of the
same class as plaintiff, from the coverage of the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is now, even if later a similar company
is set up, it cannot be subject to the tax because the ordinance expressly
points only to <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> Sugar Company, Inc. as the
entity to be levied upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, however, is not entitled to interest on the refund
because the taxes were not arbitrarily collected (Collector of Internal Revenue
v.<i> </i><span class="SpellE">Binalbagan</span>).<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
At the time of collection, the ordinance provided a sufficient basis to
preclude arbitrariness, the same being then presumed constitutional until
declared otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed,
the challenged ordinance is declared unconstitutional and the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are hereby ordered to refund the P12<span class="GramE">,087.50</span> plaintiff-appellant paid<span style="">&nbsp; </span>under protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
