				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Respondent is charged with having notarized an affidavit before the same had been signed by complainant who in fact refused to sign the same.&nbsp; Respondent denied having signed the alleged notarization.&nbsp; Upon proper investigation the Solicitor General has come to the conclusion that the complainant has failed to prove that the signature in question is that of respondent.<br><br>Going over the records, We find the report of the Solicitor General to be in order.&nbsp; The circumstances on record show that complainant must have a personal motive in charging respondent but failed to prosecute the case properly.&nbsp; He repeatedly failed to appear at the hearing.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, his cross-examination could not be finished because of his absence, and the case had to be submitted for decision without his testimony being completed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this case is dismissed and respondent is exonerated.<br><br><i>Fernando, (Chairman), Antonio, Aquino</i> and <i>Concepcion, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
