That on June 21, 1955, Arsenio Olmos, as Principal, and defendant Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co. Inc., as surety, executed AISCO Bond No. RU-2928 in the penal sum of P15,000.00 whereby they bound themselves, jointly and severally, to indemnify plaintiff for any damage, losses, charges and expenses of whatever kind and nature up to the said sum of P15,000.00 which plaintiff may incur by reason of the failure on the part of the said principal to pay his accounts and obligations and to fulfill any of the terms and conditions of his contract as distributor of sweepstakes tickets of plaintiff, x x x.&nbsp; </p><p>'5. That on June 25, 1955, defendant Arsenio Olmos obtained on credit from plaintiff 476 booklets of sweepstakes tickets for the July 17, 1955 draw with a total value of P14,970.20;&nbsp; </p><p>'6. That one of the terms and conditions of the said bond Annex 'A', is that all tickets obtained by credit by defendant Arsenio Olmos shall be considered sold and can not be returned and that he would pay and render an accounting of the same to plaintiff not later than ten (10) days after the corresponding draw unless sooner demanded by plaintiff.' <br></p></blockquote>&nbsp; <p>In the same Answer of said defendant, he admits certain allegations of the Complaint, under the Second Cause of Action, among which are as follows: </p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <blockquote><p>'10. That on June 25, 1955, defendant Arsenio Olmos obtained on credit sweepstakes tickets from plaintiff for the July 17, 1955 draw with a total value of P4,969.10; </p>&nbsp; </blockquote><p>'1. That one of the terms and conditions of the said bond, Annex 'B', is that all tickets obtained on credit by defendant Arsenio Olmos shall be considered sold and can not be returned and that he would pay and render an accounting of the same to the plaintiff not later than ten (10) days after the corresponding draw unless sooner demanded by plaintiff.' <br></p><p>He also admits certain allegations of the complaint, under the Third Cause of Action, among which are as follows: </p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>'15. That on June 29, 1955, defendant Arsenio Olmos obtained on credit from plaintiff, sweepstakes tickets for the July 17, 1955 draw with a total value of P4,969.10; </p><p>'16. That one of the terms and conditions of the said bond, Annex 'C', is that all tickets obtained on credit by defendant Arsenio Olmos shall be considered sold and cannot be returned and that he would pay and render an accounting of the same to the plaintiff not later than ten (10) days after the corresponding draw unless sooner demanded by plaintiff;&nbsp; </p></blockquote>&nbsp; <p>He also admits certain allegations of the Complaint, under the Fourth Cause of Action, among which are as follows: </p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <blockquote><p>'20. That on August 17, 23, 24 &amp; 27, 1955, defendant Arsenio Olmos obtained on credit, sweepstakes tickets from plaintiff for the September 18, 1955 draw, with a total value of P14,994.00. However, having been given a credit balance from the June 26, 1955 draw in the sum of P62.45 the total value of said sweepstakes tickets was reduced to P14,931.55;&nbsp; </p><p>'21. That one of the terms and conditions of the said bond, Annex 'D', is that all tickets obtained on credit by defendant Arsenio Olmos shall be considered sold and can not be returned and that he would pay and render an accounting of the same to the plaintiff not later than ten (10) days after the corresponding draw unless sooner demanded by plaintiff.' </p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </blockquote><p>One of the special affirmative defenses of defendant Arsenio Olmos is that the contract between him and the plaintiff has been novated by Board Resolution No. 39, passed on February 9, 1956, by the Board of Directors of plaintiff, corporation.&nbsp; </p><p>Resolution No. 39 of the Board of Directors of plaintiff corporation reads as follows:&nbsp; </p><p>'Resolution No. 39 Passed on February 9, 1956&nbsp; </p><p>'The Board was informed that the Plaridel Surety and Insurance Company, Inc. and the Associated and Surety Co., Inc., in their letters dated February 8, 1956 and February 7, 1956, respectively, indicated their conformity to the proposal of Mr. Arsenio Olmos to pay his ticket accounts which are guaranteed by bonds issued by said companies in installments at graduated rates as specified in his letter dated January 31, 1956. Member Millar stated that in most cases filed in Court against bonding companies and their principals for the collection of ticket accounts due to the failure of the principals to pay and refusal of the Sureties to make good their guaranty in accordance with the terms of their bonds, the Office encountered unavoidable delay before the cases are finally disposed of and determined by the Court; and that the proposal to allow Mr. Olmos to pay within a shorter period of time may after all necessitate the collection through Court litigation. So that, if the proposal of Mr. Olmos would be granted, he urged that it be granted subject to the condition that if he fails to pay one installment as it falls due in accordance with his aforementioned letter of January 31, 1956, the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office can proceed immediately to collect the balance of the whole amount due and still unpaid from his Sureties.&nbsp; </p><p>'On motion duly seconded, the Board resolved to grant the request of Mr. Olmos to pay his accounts in the total amount of P49,825.45 plus interest at the legal rate from the date of default, at graduated rates per month as follows: </p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <blockquote><p>'(1) P20.00 a month for the first six months beginning three months after January 31, 1956 or May, 1956;&nbsp; </p><p>'(2) P500.00 a month for the next six months beginning November, 1956;&nbsp; </p><p>'(3) P1,000.00 a month for the next six months beginning May, 1957; and&nbsp; </p><p>'(4) P2,000.00 a month beginning November, 1957, until the balance is fully paid.&nbsp; </p><p>'Provided, however, that should Mr. Olmos fail to pay any of the installments specified above on the dates they respectively fall due, the Sweepstakes Office shall take immediate necessary steps for the collection of the remaining balance still unpaid from the corresponding Surety companies. Carried unanimously.'" (Exhibit '1-Asso.') </p>&nbsp; </blockquote><p>Plaintiff presented documentary evidence to prove the pertinent allegations of its Complaint against defendant Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., which consists of sales invoices (Exhibits 'A-1' to 'A-5'), to prove the fact of delivery of sweepstakes tickets to defendant Arsenio Olmos sold to him on credit under AISCO Bond No. RU-2928 (Exhibit 'A'); sales invoice (Exhibit 'B-1'), showing the quantity of sweepstakes tickets obtained by defendant Arsenio Olmos on credit under AISCO Bond No. RU-2929 (Exhibit 'B'); sales invoices (Exhibits 'C-1' to 'C-2'), showing the quantity of sweepstakes tickets obtained on credit by defendant Arsenio Olmos under AISCO Bond No. RU-2951 (Exhibit 'C'); sales invoices (Exhibits 'D-1' to 'D-11'), showing the quantity of sweepstakes tickets obtained on credit by defendant Arsenio Olmos under AISCO Bond No. RU-4053 (Exhibit 'D'); power of attorney executed by defendant Arsenio Olmos in favor of his son, Antonio Olmos (Exhibit 'E'), showing authority of Antonio Olmos to receive the sweepstakes tickets for his principal, which he obtained from plaintiff corporation; the statement of account, dated December 3, 1956 (Exhibit 'G'), showing the account of defendant Arsenio Olmos in relation to the bonds executed by defendant Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc.; letter of demand (Exhibit 'H'); and the stamp (Exhibit 'H-1'), showing receipt of said letter by the legal counsel of defendant Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc.&nbsp; </p><p>Defendant Arsenio Olmos did not present evidence to substantiate the allegations of his Answer with Cross-Claim. However, the principal defense of defendant Arsenio Olmos, which is alleged in his Answer, is adopted by defendant Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. in its Answer.&nbsp; </p><p>In its Answer with Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint, defendant Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. alleges, as regards the first, second, third and fourth causes of action, that the plaintiff granted extension to defendant Arsenio Olmos and allowed him to pay his accounts on installments at graduated rates per month, as stated in the second paragraph of Resolution No. 39; that, by way of separate, special and affirmative defenses, (1) as first defense, the Complaint states no cause of action; (2) as second defense, plaintiff having granted extensions and renewals in the payments of the accounts of defendant Arsenio Olmos, the surety bonds posted by it are extinguished and it is relieved from liability; (3) as third defense, it was not in default in the payment of the installment of account of defendant Arsenio Olmos in accordance with the terms and conditions of Board Resolution No. 39 of plaintiff corporation; that for the first time, it was notified by the General Manager of plaintiff, by means of his letter of September 6, 1956, that defendant Arsenio Olmos had not paid his August, 1956 installment in the amount of P200; that upon receipt of said letter, it tendered payment on September 7, 1956, in the sum of P200 for August, 1956, installment of the accounts of defendant Arsenio Olmos; that the General Manager of plaintiff, in his letter of September 22, 1956, rejected the check for P200; that the tendered payment of the said sum of September 7, 1956, was in compliance with the Board Resolution No. 39; and that whatever is the balance of the accounts defendant Arsenio Olmos was not due, payable and demandable and, therefore, the action is premature; and (4) as fourth defense, plaintiff being an entity created by law can only act through its Board of Directors; that the General Manager of plaintiff has no power or authority to reject the payment of P200 to cover the installment for August, 1956, of the accounts of defendant Arsenio Olmos tendered by defendant surety company on September 7, 1956; and that only the Board of Directors of plaintiff can reject the tendered payment made by defendant surety company.&nbsp; </p><p>The evidence of defendant Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. consists of its letter, dated September 7, 1956 (Exhibit '3-Asso.'), sending therewith S.B.T.C. Check No. 513348-B (Exhibit '3-Asso.'), for P200.00, to cover the August installment on the account of defendant Arsenio Olmos; cash voucher for P200.00 in payment of installment due on account for the month of August, 1956 (Exhibit '3-Asso.'); Check No. 513485-B, dated October 1, 1956, for P200.00, payable to plaintiff corporation (Exhibit '4-Asso.'); cash voucher for P200.00 in payment of installment due for the month of September, 1956 (Exhibit '4-Asso."); Check No. 513514-B, dated October 5, 1956, for P200.00 in favor of plaintiff corporation (Exhibit '5-Asso.'); cash voucher for P200.00 for partial refund of deposit payable - payment of October, 1956, installment (Exhibit '5-Asso.'); Check No. 536878, dated November 6, 1956, for P200.00 in favor of plaintiff corporation (Exhibit '6-Asso.'); cash voucher for P200.00 in partial refund of deposit payable - payment of November installment (Exhibit '6-A-Asso.'); and the letter of the General Manager of plaintiff corporation to defendant Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., dated December 5, 1956 (Exhibit '7-Asso.'), stating therein that the remittance of P600.00, which was being returned, would be accepted by plaintiff if the P10,000.00 be remitted or paid to it as required in the resolution of the Board of Directors of October 5, 1956."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; </p> </blockquote> <p>This appeal has no merit. </p><p>The tender of payment by the defendant-appellant, Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc., of the installments not paid on the date when they fell due is not a valid defense. Under Resolution No. 39 of the Board of Directors of the plaintiff-appellee, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, once the defendant Arsenio Olmos has defaulted in the payment of a single installment, the balance of the whole amount due and still unpaid may be recovered from the appellant sureties. Said Resolution No. 39 specifically provides that should defendant Arsenio Olmos fail to pay any of the installments on the dates they respectively fell due, the plaintiff-appellee shall have the right to take immediate and necessary steps for the collection from the sureties of Arsenio Olmos the balance of the whole amount due and still unpaid. It was not necessary that the appellant, Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc., be notified of the default of the defendant Arsenio Olmos in the payment of the installments. </p><p>The refusal of the General Manager of the plaintiff-appellee to accept the payment of P200.00 to cover the installment of August 1956 of the accounts of Arsenio Olmos did not need the authority of the Board of Directors. Said General Manager was merely enforcing Resolution No. 39. </p><p>The lower court did not err in rendering judgment against the appellant. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the defendant-appellant, Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc.. </p><p><strong>SO ORDERED. </strong> </p><p> </p><p><em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Makasiar, Santos</em>, and <em>Guerrero, JJ.</em>, concur. </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr align="left" width="60%"> <p> </p><p> </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Record on Appeal, pp. 154-157, Rollo, p. 14. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Brief for the Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., pp. 1-2, Rollo, p. 37. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Rollo, pp. 55-67. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Brief for the Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., p. 1, Rollo, p. 37. </p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Record on Appeal, pp. 124-139, Rollo, p. 14.</p> </div>
