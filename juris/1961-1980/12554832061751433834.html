				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision
of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA case No. 357 denying petitioner-appellant's
claim for refund of the sum of P21,093.36 representing alleged deficiency (plus
25% surcharge thereon) in the sales tax paid by it for the period beginning
January 18, 1948 thru January 31, 1949.<o:p></o:p><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant, a domestic corporation,
is engaged in the importation of general merchandise. The original assessment
for such tax was made on September 3, 1949, in the amount of P29<span class="GramE">,365.50</span>, corresponding to the third quarter of 1946 and the
period from the first quarter of, 1948 to the first quarter of 1949. It was
later reduced to P21<span class="GramE">,716.54</span>. Appellant contested the
validity of the assessment, but deposited with <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
a cheek for the amount on </span><st1:date year="1950" day="8" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 8, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On August 30, 1956 the deposit
was converted into payment, which was followed by a formal request for refund
on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="8" month="9"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 8, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The request was denied on </span><st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January
 20, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">
and so appellant filed a petition for review in the Court of Tax Appeals. On </span><st1:date year="1957" day="6" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March
 6, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
after some adjustment whereby <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> recognized
appellant's right to a refund of P623.18, the amount involved in the petition
was finally reduced to P21<span class="GramE">,093.36</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The controversy involves the
application of Section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code and of General
Circulars No. 431 and 440 promulgated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue to
implement the said provision of the tax statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The pertinent portion of section
186 is as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"There is levied, assessed,
and collected once only on every original sale, barter, exchange and similar
transaction intended to transfer ownership of, or title to, the articles not
enumerated in sections one hundred eighty four and one hundred eighty-five a
tax equivalent to five <i>per centum</i>, of the gross selling price or gross
value in money of the articles so sold, bartered, exchanged or transferred. * *
*.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">General Circular No. 431 states: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"*** 'Gross selling price' or
    'gross value in money' of the articles sold, bartered, exchanged, or
    transferred as the term is used in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
    sections of the National Internal Revenue Code, is the total amount of money or
    its equivalent which the purchaser pays to the vendor to receive or get the
    goods. However, if a manufacturer, producer, or importer, in fixing the gross
    selling price of an article sold by him, has included an amount of money
    intended to cover the sales tax in the gross selling price of the articles, the
    sales tax shall be based on the gross selling price less the amount intended to
    cover the tax, if the same be billed to the purchaser as separate item. * *
    *."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">General Circular No. 440,
supplementing General <span class="SpellE">CircularNo</span>. 431, provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“*** Unless billed to the purchaser
    as separate items in the invoice, the amounts intended to cover the sales tax
    shall be considered as part of the gross selling price of the articles sold,
    and deductions thereof will not be allowed."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Up to January 17, 1948, every
sales invoice issued by appellant, among those originally questioned by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, contained an itemization of the actual selling
price and of the 5% sales tax thereon, which was then added to the selling
price and shifted to the customer, who paid the total amount. This procedure,
by stipulation of the parties in the court below, constituted full compliance
with General Circulars 431 and 440. From </span><st1:date year="1948" day="18" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 18, 1948</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to </span><st1:date year="1949" day="31" month="1"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January
 31, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">,
however, the sales invoices merely showed one single amount in each instance,
namely, the total of the actual selling price and of the corresponding sales
tax, with the notation of the phrase "5% sales tax included." The
customer paid appellant for the goods purchased the amount thus indicated, and
appellant in turn paid the sales tax to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as
computed on the basis of the actual selling price alone, that is, without
including the tax which had been shifted to the customer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The alleged deficiency assessed
against appellant and now subject of the instant case for refund is the
difference between the <span class="GramE">amount</span> resulting from the two
methods of computation. Thus, for instance in a sale of goods priced at P100
without the tax, appellant computed the 5% tax to be P5.00, billing the
customer for the amount of P105.00; while <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
computation was P5.25, based on the sum actually paid by the customer,
resulting in a difference of P0.25 for every such sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The sole issue in this case is
whether or not the mere notation of the words "5% sales tax included"
on the questioned invoices of appellant complies with the circulars <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>, which expressly require a separate billing to
the customer of the amount intended to cover the tax in order that it may be
deducted from the gross selling price for purposes of tax computation. What is
gross selling price is defined in General Circular No. 431 as "the total
amount of money or its equivalent which the purchaser pays to the vendor to
receive or get the goods." The correctness of this definition is not
disputed. The 5% sales tax under Section 186 of the Revenue Code is imposed on
such gross selling price, including the tax itself when it is shifted to the
customer, for that is the total amount that he pays to receive the goods
purchased by him. The deduction that is allowed by the two circulars
constitutes in effect an exception to the rule established by the statute, and
may be availed of only if the amount intended to cover the tax is billed to the
purchaser as a separate item. As correctly stated by the Court of Tax Appeals,
the exception is merely a privilege granted to the taxpayer which, if he is to
claim its benefits, must be complied with by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The idea of separate billing is
too clear and specific to admit of different interpretations. It means that the
amount of the tax must be stated as an item apart. The requirement is
emphasized in General Circular No. 440, which states that <i>"unless</i>
billed to the purchaser as <i>separate items</i> in the invoices, the amounts
intended to cover the sales tax shall be considered as part of the gross
selling price of the articles sold and <i>deductions thereof will not be
allowed."</i> (Italic supplied.) Certainly a simple indication on the
invoice that the 5% tax is already included in the aggregate sum charged to the
customer cannot be a separate hilling of the amount of such tax. It is
purposeless to distinguish between substantial or strict compliance with the
requirement, as the parties have essayed to do: the amount of the tax must
appear as a separate item, and this is the only manner of complying that is
possible. The intention, evidently, is to apprise the customer of the exact
amount of the tax that is passed on to him for payment. It is suggested that he
can determine the amount by simple mathematical computation. How many customers
would have the ability or the patience to go through the process? And since
after all the benefits of separately billing the amount of the tax accrue to
the taxpayer, it is fair and logical that the task of computing and indicating
it on the invoice should devolve upon him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The resolution of the defunct Board
of Tax Appeals in the case of Fred Wilson &amp; Company, Inc. (T.A. No. 63),
dated December 11, 1952, is relied upon by appellant here. In that case, to be
sure, the Board ruled that the notation of the words "tax included"
on the sales invoices issued by a taxpayer constituted substantial compliance
with General Circular No. 431, as amended. The ruling, however, binds neither
the Court of Tax Appeals nor this Court. Nor could it have been a guide for
appellant in connection with the sales covered by the instant case, for those
sales took place in 1948 and 1949, before the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wilson</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> case was decided. Appellant,
therefore, is in no position to invoke said ruling as a contemporary
administrative interpretation of the circulars in question. If <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> here, as the administrative authority concerned,
subsequently adopted a different, and as we see it, correct, interpretation,
appellant can claim no vested right in the error, not having been led to act on
strength thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The last question refers to the 25%
surcharge imposed upon appellant, amounting to P4<span class="GramE">,343.31</span>.
Appellant seeks relief <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and cites the
following applicable principles, from which the Solicitor General expresses no
dissent: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The question of whether the
specific penalty in addition to the 25% surcharge will be enforced, in cases of
delinquency in paying the percentage taxes is one of discretion with the
Collector of Internal Revenue. In all cases where the delinquent has delayed
the administration of the law or has intentionally violated the provisions of
the law,, or has purposely delayed filing the return, the Collector of Internal
Revenue will insist on enforcing the specific penalty for failure to make
return within the time prescribed by law. Failure to make this return and pay
the tax during the months in which the said taxes are payable will be
considered as purposely delaying filing the return. The necessity of notifying
the taxpayer of his delinquency or the discovery of such a delinquency by a
revenue officer will be treated as delaying: the administration of the
law." (Sec. 15 (<i>c</i>), Reg. No. 11, <span class="SpellE">Formilleza</span>,
Commentaries on the National Internal Revenue Code, Vol. II, pp. 712-713, I950
ed.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are convinced that appellant, in
preparing its sales invoices as it did, was not guilty of an intentional
violation of the law. It did not delay filing- the returns for the sales taxes
corresponding to the period in question, let alone did so purposely. The delay
was in the payment of the deficiency, which arose from a mistaken understanding
of the regulations laid down by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. The ensuing
controversy was, in our opinion, generated in good faith and should furnish no
justification for the imposition of a penalty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Wherefore, modified by eliminating the
surcharge of 25% imposed upon appellant, the judgment appealed from is
affirmed, without costs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
moves for reconsideration of our decision of December 28, 1963, and prays that
the same be modified by declaring that petitioner-appellant is liable for the
25% surcharge for late payment of its deficiency sales tax for the period from
January 18, 1948 to January 31, 1949.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In support of his stand, respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> cites Section 183 (a) of the Tax Code and the
cases of Lim Co Chui <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>, 47 Phil.
460; <span class="SpellE">Jamora</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Meer</span>,
74 Phil. 22; Koppel (Philippines) Inc. <i>vs.</i> Collector of Internal
Revenue, 87 Phil. 348; Republic of the Philippines <i>vs.</i> Luzon Industrial
Corporation 102 Phil., 189, Lim <span class="SpellE">Chai</span> <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> <i>vs.</i> Trinidad 41 Phil. 544; Insular Lumber Co. <i>vs.</i>

Revenue, L-13203, January 28, 1961; Liddell and Co., Inc. <i>vs.</i> Collector
of Internal Revenue, L-9687, June 30, 1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We do not think Section 183 (a) of
the National Internal Revenue Code is applicable. The same imposes the penalty
of 25% when the percentage tax is not paid on time, and contemplates a case
where the liability for the tax is undisputed or indisputable. In the present
case the taxes were paid, the delay being with reference to the deficiency,
owing to a controversy as to the proper interpretation of Circulars Nos. 431
and 440 of the office of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. The
controversy was generated in good faith, since that office itself appears to
have formerly taken the view that the inclusion of the words "tax
included" on invoices issued by the taxpayer was sufficient compliance
with the requirements' of said circulars. (See BIR Ruling 105.2, Aug. 3, 1953;
BIR Quarterly Bulletin Vol. 7, Sept. 30 and Dee. 31, 1953; In re Fred Wilson
Tax Appeal No. 63.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The cases cited in the motion for
reconsideration are likewise inapplicable. In every one of those cases the
liability for the tax was not disputed, the only question being whether or not
the delay in the payment thereof was justified under the particular
circumstances relied upon by the taxpayer. Here the question is whether or not
the deficiency" sales tax in question was due at all. This question does
not involve the power of respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to
condone the penalty, but rather the justifiability of its imposition in. the
first place. And where respondent <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> apparently
had himself originally adopted an incorrect interpretation of its own
circulars, it would not be just to penalized appellant for falling into the
same error. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Wherefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.</p>
