				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A feature which, to say the least, is rather unusual, distinguishes
this litigation from other forcible entry suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> as well as the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental were as one in dismissing a complaint for
forcible entry precisely because, on plaintiffs' own pleadings, it would appear
that the lot, the possession of which was allegedly entered into by force by
defendant, is different from that made the basis of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appeal, then, from the order of dismissal
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental,
must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint for forcible entry was filed by plaintiffs Pedro <span class="SpellE">Capacio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florentina</span> U. <span class="SpellE">Capacio</span>, spouses, against defendant Jose Rivera in the City
Court of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After alleging the ownership and possession
of a certain parcel of residential land located in such city, it set forth that
on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1966</st1:date>,
defendant, with the help of hired men, unlawfully entered a portion thereof, an
illegal possession which had continued notwithstanding the demands made by
plaintiffs for him to vacate the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The answer was duly filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="3">March 6,
 1967</st1:date> by defendant denying the truth of the allegation and setting
forth as one of the affirmative defenses that the land in question was owned
and occupied by him in the concept of owner, publicly, openly, continuously and
adversely as far back as 1938.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came, on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="4">April 17,
 1967</st1:date>, the order of dismissal by the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>, the relevant
portion of which was quoted in the brief for plaintiffs-appellants. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"From the evidence adduced by defendant during the trial of the
latter's affirmative defenses, it has been found that defendant's land is known
as Lot No. 4349, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3111 of the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Cadastre, whereas
that of the plaintiffs is a portion of Lot No. 4359 of the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Cadastre as evidenced by the Deed of Absolute
Sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagting</span>
in favor of plaintiffs, dated September 6, 1941, marked as Annex 'B' to
plaintiffs' complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore
glaring that plaintiffs' land is different from that of the defendant (p. 48,
record on appeal)."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
An order of dismissal was thus entered.</p>

<p class="BODY">What transpired next was set forth in the aforesaid brief as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On April 25, 1967
plaintiffs thru their Counsel moved for reconsideration of the order of
dismissal on April 27, 1967 and prayed to the Honorable City Court to conduct
an ocular inspection of subject land to view its identity and the damages
caused by defendant on improvements of plaintiffs, but the City Court summarily
denied said motion on May 10, 1967 without hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, plaintiffs appealed to the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a pre-trial before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental, after which the order of dismissal, now on appeal, was issued on <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was therein stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This case is before this Court for
preliminary hearing on the allegations of the complaint and in the answer
wherein both parties claim ownership of the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs claim having bought the land from
a certain person, whereas defendant likewise claims having acquired ownership
of this parcel of land from a person whose ownership was evidenced by a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title, so that the defendant is now the owner under a certificate of title in
his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the allegations of the
complaint and the answer, there seems to be a difference between the parcel
that the plaintiffs are claiming and that claimed by defendant Dr. Jose
Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This difference was, noted by
the City Judge who, after conducting a preliminary hearing of the case,
dismissed it on the ground that the land claimed by plaintiffs is different
from that claimed by defendant</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court then ordered the dismissal of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is from such order, as mentioned earlier,
that an appeal on a question of law was elevated to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the above facts, again as made clear at
the outset, plaintiffs-appellants cannot possibly hope to succeed.</p>

<p class="BODY">They would rely, in this appeal, on the applicable Rules of Court
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A perfected appeal shall operate to
vacate the judgment of the justice of the peace or the municipal court, and the
action when duly docketed in the Court of First Instance shall stand for trial <u>de</u>
<u>novo</u> upon its merits in accordance with the regular procedure in that
court, as though the same had never been tried before and had been originally
there commenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the appeal is
withdrawn, or dismissed for failure to prosecute, the judgment shall be deemed
revived and shall forthwith be remanded to the justice of the peace or the
municipal court for execution."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Their insistence is that a trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> implies that what was
done in the City Court could not be taken into account by the Court of First
Instance which is required to hear the case anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted in their brief:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The lower court, in dismissing the
instant case on appeal, mainly relied on the oral remarks of counsel for both
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not conducted a hearing
either on the main issues of the case or on the affirmative defenses alleged by
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be noted that defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has
raised questions of facts in his affirmative defenses and which questions of
facts, particularly the identity of the land in dispute, were properly ventilated
in the City Court where it originated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By virtue of the appeal to the Court of First Instance, the latter Court
should have conducted a hearing, either on the main issues of the case or of
the affirmative defenses pleaded by defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
in order that it could arrive at a fair and just appraisal of the facts wherein
it could anchor its findings and conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this end, the trial Court failed, but had rather disposed of the
instant case summarily, thereby skipping a thorough and judicious appraisal of
the issues involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely affirmed
the findings of facts of the City Court with respect to the identity of the
land in dispute."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of plaintiffs-appellants is not sufficiently
persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an approach could not
be devoid of merit if there were no basis for the finding that the lot alleged
by plaintiffs-appellants to have been entered into forcibly by defendant is
different from that occupied by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
very Annex B attached to their complaint, whose existence cannot be ignored by
any one reading it, speaks of Lot No. 4359 as distinguished from defendant's
land known as Lot No. 4349.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it
is inaccurate to assert that the lower court Judge relied merely on what was
done by the City Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did hear the
parties on pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would thus be
undeniable that even prior to such a stage in the proceeding, that fatal dis­crepancy
could be duly taken note of by the lower court and would call for the dismissal
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said then that
the conclusion arrived at by the lower court is bereft of support in law, the
very pleadings of plaintiffs-appellants demonstrating the inherent weakness of
their suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the order of
dismissal, which we must uphold.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal of the lower court of
September 21, 1967 is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
costs against plaintiffs-appellants.</p>
