				<BR><STRONG>CAPISTRANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On March 19, 1959, in the Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, eleven <span class="GramE">brothers</span> and sisters,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Allanigue</span>, brought an action (Civil Case
No. 217-R) against their sister, <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Allani­gue</span>, her husband, Simeon Santos, Maria San Agus­tin
and <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> San Agustin, for partition of a
360-square-meter lot situated at San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and for the
annulment of cer­tain conveyances involving the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants having been declared in default,
the trial court, after hearing the plaintiffs' evidence, rendered judgment
ordering the partition of the lot among the eleven plaintiffs and the defendant
<span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Allanigue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a subsequent order the court set off <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Allanigue's</span> share against
the amount that she had failed to pay as rents to the plain­tiffs as directed
in the decision. </p>

<p class="BODY">A writ of execution was issued on the judgment or­dering the
defendants to vacate the lot and deliver its possession to the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo Santos, not a party defendant but a
son of defendants Simeon Santos and <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Allanigue</span>, owned a house standing on the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed with the sheriff a third-party
claim, and with the court, a motion to recall the writ of execution in­sofar as
his house was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 15, 1962, the
defendants and <span class="SpellE">movant</span> Leonardo Santos having failed
to remove their houses from the lot within the period given them, the court
ordered the she­riff to demolish said houses. </p>

<p class="BODY">On April 2, 1962, Leonardo Santos and the defendants in the case
as petitioners, filed in the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari and
prohibition, G.R. No.L-19618, against Judge Angel H. <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>,
the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and the plaintiffs in
the case, as respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the
issues raised therein was whether or not the lower court had jurisdiction to
order the demolition of petitioners' houses in that special civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision of February 28, 1964, the
Supreme Court denied the petition after finding that Leonardo Santos, who
claimed to be the owner of a house and the portion of land on which it stood by
purchase from his parents, did not follow the procedure sanctioned by law in
vindi­cating his alleged ownership, i.e., he should have filed an ordinary
civil action to vindicate his alleged owner­ship of the house and the portion
of land on which it was built.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the said decision of the Supreme Court had be­come final,
the respondent Judge, Angel H. <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>, on mo­tion of
the plaintiffs in the same Civil Case No. 217-R, ordered the demolition of the
defendants' houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants
having voluntarily removed their houses, the only house that remained standing
on the lot was that belonging to Leonardo Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the res­pondent Judge, on
motion of the plaintiffs, issued an order dated December 9, 1965, directing the
sheriff to demolish the house of Leonardo Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for certiorari
and prohibition in this Court where Leonardo Santos, petitioner, questions the
jurisdiction of the respondent Judge in issuing the order of demolition of his
house. </p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition for certiorari and prohibition should be denied
in view of the following considerations:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Leonardo
Santos is bound by the judg­ment in Civil Case No. 217-R because he is a
successor­-in-interest of his parents, Simeon Santos and <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span>
<span class="SpellE">Allanigue</span>, defendants in Civil Case No. 217-R, and
his right, if any, is claimed under them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the judgment in said civil case binds not only Simeon Santos and <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Allanigue</span> but also their
son, Leonardo Santos, who is their successor-in-interest and who claims under
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the sale to Leonardo
Santos from his parents was <span class="GramE">registered,</span> is of no
moment because, as pointed out, he is bound by the judgment against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Leonardo Santos' house having been built and re­constructed
(after March, 1962) into a bigger one after his predecessors-in-interest, his
parents, had been summoned in 1959 in Civil Case No. 217-R, he must be deemed a
builder in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As builder in bad
faith he lost the improvement made by him consisting of the reconstructed house
to the owners of the land without right to indemnity, pursuant to Article 449
of the Civil Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 449.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He who
builds, plants or sows in bad faith on the land of another, loses what is
built, planted or sown without right to indemnity.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The <span class="SpellE">Allanigue</span>
brothers and sisters therefore became owners of the improvement consisting of
the house built in bad faith by Leonardo Santos if they chose to appropriate
the acces­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Articles
445 and 449, Civil Code.)</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, said owners could choose instead the demolition of the improvement
or building at the expense of the builder, pursuant to Article 450 of the Civil
Code, which, in part, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 450.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of
the land on which anything has been built, planted or sown in bad faith may
demand the demolition of the work, or that the planting or sowing be removed,
in order to replace things in their former condition at the expense of the
person who built, planted or sowed * * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is of record in Civil Case No. 217-R
that the owners of the land chose to have the house or improvement demo­lished
pursuant to their motion for demolition which was granted by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> on December 9, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The present petition is barred by the prior judg­ment of this
Court in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-19618.</span> Herein petitioner, Leonardo
Santos, was one of the petitioners in that case against the same official and
private respondents in the instant petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the two cases there is identity of subject-matter, namely, the
portion of the lot and the house standing on said portion alleged by petitioner
to belong to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also identity
of cause of action, to wit: the order of the respondent Judge for the removal
or demolition of the houses standing on the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the previous case this Court had
jurisdiction, and its decision, which was on the merits, had become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident that the judgment of this Court
in G.R. No.L-19618 is <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>
in the instant case on the question of the validity of the order of demolition
of <st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1965">December 9, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is denied, with treble
costs against the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ
of preli­minary injunction issued by this Court is hereby dissolved. </p>
