				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal direct to this Court, on <span style="">a </span>ques­tion
of law, from the order of the Court of <span style="">First
In­</span>stance of Manila, dated <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7">July
 20, 1964</st1:date>, in its Civil Case No. 56876, granting defendants' motion
to dismiss plaintiff's amended complaint, as well as from a subse­quent order,
dated <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1964</st1:date>,
denying plain­tiff's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 25, 1964, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> V.
Shaffer filed <span style="">a
</span>complaint against defendant spouses Virginia G. <span style="">Palma </span>and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Palma to recover
certain sums of money and shares of stock, alleging, among others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that plaintiff is the widow of the late
Nicolas R. <span class="SpellE">Lynevit­che</span>, the Managing Director of the
British American Engineering Corporation, who had himself insured for
P300,000.00 with the Great American Insurance Company against accidental death,
designating the British American Corporation as beneficiary (Policy No.
PA-0132); that while <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> and plaintiff were
living as husband and wife they received from defendants advances and loans <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P32,000.00, and to secure payment thereof <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lyne­</span>vitche</span>
delivered to them his 175 shares of stock of the British American <span class="SpellE">Enginnering</span> Corporation; that when <span class="SpellE">Lyne­vitche</span>
was made to understand by defendants that the shares pledged by him were
insufficient to secure the payment of the loans and advances given by
defendants, <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>, in his capacity as managing
director of the British American Engineering Corporation, executed, on April
17, 1962, a deed of assignment<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
transferring the right of <span style="">said </span>corporation
as beneficiary in his insurance policy in favor of plaintiff and herein
defendant Virgi­nia G. Palma; that the deed of assignment <span style="">was </span>subsequent­ly ratified and
confirmed by the corporation's board of directors in a resolution dated May 10,
1962;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that de­fendants knew that defendant Virginia Palma was included as one of the
assignees of the insurance policy so that defendants would have additional
security for the loans and advances given by them to the insured and plaintiff;
that on May 26, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> died in an accident
in Tokyo, Japan, and so the Great American Insurance Company paid P300,000.00
to the plaintiff and defendant Virginia Palma as assignees of the insurance
policy; that the pro­ceeds of the insurance policy was deposited in the name of
the plaintiff with the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> &amp; Shanghai
Banking Corporation on August 15, 1962; that immediately after depositing said
proceeds, defendant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Palma asked plaintiff
to issue a check of P150,000.00 in favor of his wife, the defendant Virginia G.
Palma, with the under­standing that after proper accounting and adjustments of
the loans and advances previously obtained by plaintiff and the late <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> from defendants the excess would be returned to
the plaintiff; that plaintiff later asked defendants to render an accounting of
the loans and ad­vances and to return to her the balance of the P150,000.00
after deducting the payment of said loans and advances, and the 175 shares that
were given as security for the <span style="">loans
and advances, but the defendants refused to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff prayed in her complaint that judgment
be rendered ordering the defendants, <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>solidum</u></span>,
to pay plain</span>tiff the sum of P118,000.00, with legal interest thereon
from <span style="">the </span>filing of the
complaint, to pay P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, to return to plaintiff the 175
shares given as security, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1964</st1:date>,
defendants filed a motion to dis­miss plaintiff's complaint upon the grounds
that the com­plaint states no cause of action and that plaintiff has no
capacity to sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was opposed
by plaintiff, and after the filing by defendants of their reply, and plaintiff
her replica, the lower court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="5">May
 25, 1964</st1:date>, issued an order dismissing the complaint, the pertinent
portions of which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Paragraphs 5 and 6 of plaintiff's com­plaint in effect allege
that the Deed of As­signment (Annex A) and the corporate resolu­tion (Annex B)
do not express the true intention of the assignor British American En­gineering
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arguendo</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>that this is the truth, the British
American Engineering Corporation and not the plain­tiff is the party that may
sue to enforce the true intention of the assignor and the assignees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Stated differently, plaintiff's com­plaint states no cause of
action in favor of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the allegations of the complaint a judgment may, if at all, be rendered in
favor of the British American Engineering Corporation, but not in favor of the
herein plaintiff."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1964</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed a motion to <span style="">ad­mit </span>an
amended complaint, which was attached to said mo­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint contained new
allegations which were intended to specify or clarify certain points that <span style="">were </span>alleged in the original complaint
- and pre­cisely for the purpose of curing the defects of the ori­ginal
complaint as pointed out in the order of the court dismissing said original
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1964</st1:date>, plaintiff also filed a motion for
reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="5">May
 25, 1964</st1:date> so as to give way to the admission of the amended
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants filed an oppo­sition
to the motion for reconsideration and an alterna­tive motion to dismiss the
amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion <span style="">to </span>dismiss <span style="">the amended complaint was based on the same </span><span style="">grounds as those alleged in the motion to
dismiss the original complaint - that the amended complaint states no cause of
action, and that the plaintiff has no capa­city to sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7"><span style="">July 20, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court <span style="">issued </span>an order granting plaintiff's motion for reconsideration
and admitting the amended complaint, but at the same time granting defendants'
motion to dismiss the amended com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pertinent portion of the order reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This Court agrees with defendants' counsel that the amended
complaint is sub­stantially the same as the original one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraphs 5 and 7 of the amended complaint,
like the corresponding paragraphs 5 and 6 of the original complaint, in effect
allege that the Deed of Assignment (Annex A), and the corporate resolution
(Annex B), do not express the true intention of the assignor British American
Engineering Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
said assignment speaks for it­self and may, if at all, be ordered reform­ed to <span style="">express </span>the true intention of the as­signor
by action of the assignor for reform­ation of said deed of assignment (Art.
1359, New Civil Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the 175 shares of British Amer­ican Engineering
Corporation, the amended complaint fails to allege facts showing plaintiff's
right to said shares."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1964</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed her motion for reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="9">Septem­ber
 17, 1964</st1:date>, the lower court issued an order denying plaintiff's
motion for reconsideration, which order reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Paragraphs 7, 9, 10 and 12 of the Amend­ed Complaint, which
according to the plain­tiff must be deemed admitted for the purpose of the
motion to dismiss, cannot be allowed as amendments to the original complaint,
as they substantially alter the causes of act­ion alleged in the original
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, par. 7 of the amended
complaint alleges, <span style="">among others that
'the defendants have acknow­ledged and agreed with the plaintiff that the </span>defendant
Virginia G. Palma's interest <span style="">as </span>co-assignee ... <span style="">was
up to the extent of the </span><span style="">total </span>amount of the loans and ad­vances made
by the defendants to N. R. <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>', but <span style="">par. 6 of the original </span><span style="">complaint did </span><span style="">not allege any acknowledg­ment or agreement
of the </span><span style="">defendants
to </span>this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again par. 9 of
the amend­ed complaint alleges agreement in this regard, but par. 8 of the
original com­plaint, <span style="">its </span>counterpart, does not so <span style="">al­lege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, </span>par. 12
of the amended complaint alleges that the 175 shares were indorsed to the
plaintiff prior to <span class="SpellE">Lyne­vitche's</span> death, but par. 10
of the original complaint mentioned no such prior <span class="SpellE">indorse­ment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, therefore, agrees with the
defendants that these decisive amend­ments cannot legally be allowed <span style="">as </span>they
radically change or alter the original causes of action or theory of the plain­tiff
<span style="">(see </span>last 6 lines, page 3,
defend­ants' rejoinder, found on page 48, Records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At any rate, the alleged agreement to this effect involves
the amount of P118, 000.00 (pars. 13 and 14, Amended Answer), and, unless in
writing is <span class="SpellE">unenforcible</span> (last paragraph, Art. 1358,
New Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the defendants were
entitled to only P32,000.00, it is odd that instead of draw­ing a check in
their favor for only P32, 000.00, the plaintiff issued to them a check for
P150,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case must be dismissed
on this additional ground <span style="">(Sec. 1(<span class="SpellE">i</span>), </span>Rule <span style="">16, </span>Revised Rules of Court.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the present appeal,
plaintiff contends that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) in dismissing the amended complaint, </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">its order of July 20,
1964; and (2) in declaring, in its order of September 17, 1964 when it resolved
plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, that the amendments in the amended </span><span style="">complaint can not </span><span style="">be admitted and, therefore, the amended complaint
should be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is merit in this
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7">July 20,
 1964</st1:date>, the lower court re­considered its previous order of <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1964</st1:date> dismissing the original
complaint and then admitted the amended com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint had thereby superseded
the original complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants
filed <span style="">a </span>motion to dismiss the
amended complaint upon the grounds that it does not state a cause of action and
that the plaintiff has no capacity to sue -<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the same grounds upon which the motion to dismiss the original complaint
was based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the very same order of <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1964</st1:date> which admitted the
amended complaint, the lower court dismissed said amended com­plaint - for the
same reasons that it <span style="">dismissed the ori­</span>ginal
complaint, namely, that the plaintiff has no capa­city to sue and that the
complaint states no cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We
have exam­</span>ined the allegations of the amended complaint, and We find
that the plaintiff has the legal capacity to <span style="">sue </span>and that the amended complaint states a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Substan­<span style="">tially, it </span>is alleged in the amended complaint:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the plaintiff and the late Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> <span style="">lived as
</span>husband and wife; that on March 27, 1962, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>
had himself insured for P300,000.00 with the Great American Insurance Company
of New York against accidental death, designating the British American
Engineering Corporation, in which he was the managing director, as the <span style="">beneficiary; </span>that the plaintiff and
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> had obtained loans and advances
from the defendants, <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P32, 000.00; that to
secure the payment of the loans and ad­vances obtained by plaintiff and Nicolas
<span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> from the defendants, <span style="">Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>
delivered </span>to the defendants 175 shares of stock of the British American
En­gineering Corporation; that on April 17, 1962, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Ly­nevitche</span>,
as managing director of the British American Engineering Corporation, executed
a deed of assignment of the corporation's right as beneficiary in <span style="">his </span>life <span style="">in­</span>surance policy in favor of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span>
V. Shaffer and the defendant Virginia G. Palma, which <span style="">deed </span>of assign­ment was ratified and confirmed by the board of
directors of the British American Engineering Corporation on <span style="">May </span>10, 1962; that the defendants
acknowledged and <span style="">agreed </span>with the
plaintiff that the interest of defendant <span style="">Virginia G. Pal­</span>ma as co-assignee of the proceeds of the insurance
policy of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> was to the extent of the
total amount of the loans and advances made by the defendants to Nico­las <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> and the plaintiff during the lifetime of said
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>; that on May 26, 1962, <span style="">Nicolas </span><span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>
died in Tokyo, Japan, in an accident, and by reason thereof the Great American
Insurance Company, on August 15, 1962, issued <span style="">a </span>check <span style="">for </span>P300,000.00
in fa­<span style="">vor of <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span>
V. Shaffer and Virginia G. <span style="">Palma as as­signees
</span>of the proceeds of the </span><span style="">insurance policy of Nicolas </span><span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>; that confirming the agreement that the interest
of defendant Virginia <span class="SpellE">Plama</span> <span style="">in </span>the proceeds of the insurance policy was to the extent of the
amount of the loans and advances which the defendants had given to Nico­las <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> and the plaintiff, the defendant Virginia Palma
endorsed along with the plaintiff the check for P300,000.00 and the plaintiff <span style="">deposited </span>the whole amount with the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and Shanghai Banking Corporation in her name and
credit, to await adjustment and determination of the exact amount of the loans
and advances which were obtained from the defendants by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> and the plaintiff which was payable out of the
proceeds of the insurance; that defendants, availing of the plaintiff's <span style="">feeling of </span>gratitude towards them and
manifesting their need for funds, prevailed upon plaintiff to <span style="">issue </span>a check for P150,000.00 in favor
of defendant Virginia G. Palma, upon the condi­tion that after the adjustment
and accounting of the above-mentioned advances and loans the <span style="">excess </span>of the amount stated in the
check over the amount of the loans and ad­vances would be refunded to the
plaintiff; that pursuant to said representation of the defendants, plaintiff <span style="">is­</span>sued a check in favor of defendant
Virginia G. Palma, and the latter endorsed the check to her husband who in turn
cashed the same; that thereafter plaintiff requested the defendants to make
adjustment and full accounting of the loans and advances and to return to her
the balance of the P150,000.00 and the 175 shares that were given <span style="">as </span>security, which Mares had been
endorsed to plaintiff prior to the death of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>;
that the plaintiff made re­peated demands on the defendants to return the sun
of P118,000.00 which represented the excess over the loans and advances and
also the 175 shares, but the defendants refused to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, in her amended complaint,
therefore, prayed that the defendants be ordered to pay her, <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>solidum</u></span>, the sum of P118,000.00 with legal in­<span style="">terest </span>from the date of tiling of the
complaint and to return to her the 175 shares that were pledged to secure the
payment of the loans and advances, and also to pay P10,000.00 as attorney's
fees, plus the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">can </span>thus be
seen that in her amended complaint the plaintiff is suing the defendants in the
capacity of one who has an interest to protect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was suing for the return to her of the balance of the <span style="">amount of P150,000.00 which was stated in a
check </span>that she had <span style="">is­</span><span style="">sued </span>in favor
of defendant Virginia G. Palma, pursuant to the understanding that out of that
amount the loans and advances which the plaintiff and the late Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Ly­nevitche</span> had obtained from the defendants would be paid,
it being alleged in the complaint that the plaintiff and defendant Virginia
Palma were made assignees of the pro­ceeds of the insurance policy of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span> <span style="">under
the agreement that the interest of defendant Virginia G. Palma as co-assignee </span>of
the proceeds of the insurance policy was only to the extent of the total amount
of the loans and advances obtained by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>
<span style="">and the </span>plaintiff from the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can easily be under­stood
from the allegations of the amended complaint that the plaintiff <span style="">was claiming </span>for herself the entire
amount of the proceeds of the insurance policy of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lyne­vitche</span>
after deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the amount of <span style="">P32,000.</span>00 to pay for the loans and
advances that had been ob­tained by plaintiff and Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>
from the defendants, so much so that the entire proceeds of P300,000.00 was
deposited in her name alone with the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff <span style="">alleges in </span>the amended
complaint that she issued her own check for P150,000.00 in favor of defendant
Virginia G. Palma <span style="">upon representation </span>by
the defendants that they needed funds, but that adjustment and accounting would
be made of the loans and advances and they would return to her <span style="">whatever </span>would be the <span style="">excess of </span>that amount of P150,000.00
over the amount of the loans and advances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It can also be readily <span style="">seen in </span>the
amended complaint that the plaintiff is suing for the return of the 175 shares,
which were pledged to the defendants for the security of the loans and
advances, in her capacity as the owner of <span style="">those shares, it being al­leged </span>that those shares had been
endorsed to her prior to the death of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span>the settled
rule that in a motion to <span style="">dismiss </span>an
action upon the ground that the complaint <span style="">states </span>no <span style="">cause </span>of
action, the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span style="">is </span>deemed to <span style="">admit, at
least hypothetically, </span>the facts <span style="">alleged
in </span>the complaint or counterclaim, as the case may be.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our considered <span style="">view that based on the facts alleged in the amended complaint, now in
question, the plaintiff has a cause of action against the defendants, and that
the plaintiff has the legal capacity to sue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of September 17, 1964, denying plain­tiff's motion
for reconsideration of the order dismissing the amended complaint, the lower
court, however, added as further grounds in dismissing the amended complaint
that the amendments embodied in the amended complaint are not admissible
because said amendments have radically changed or altered the original causes
of action or theory of the plaintiff; and that the agreement alleged in the
amended complaint, involving as it does the amount of P118,000. 00, cannot be
enforced because it is not in writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>also do
not agree with the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In determining whether a different cause of action is introduced
by amendments to the complaint, what <span style="">is </span>to be ascertained <span style="">is </span>whether the defendant shall be
required to answer for a liability or legal obligation wholly dif­ferent from
that which was stated in the original com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An amendment will not be considered as
stating a new cause of action if the facts alleged in the amended complaint
show substantially the <span style="">same </span>wrong with respect to the same transaction, or if what are
alleged refer to the same matter but are more fully and differently stated, or
where averments which were implied are made in expressed terms, and the subject
of the controversy or the liability sought to be enforced remains the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, a comparison between the
allegations appearing in the original complaint and in the amended complaint
will readily show that the action of the plaintiff is the same -that <span style="">is, </span>for the
return of the sum of P118,000.00, and the return of the 175 shares of stock
which had been given to the defendants <span style="">as </span>security for the payment of the loans and
advances obtained from them by the plaintiff and the late Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, what is being enforced against the defendants, both in the original
complaint and in the amended complaint, is the obligation to refund to the
plaintiff the sum of P118,000.00 and to return to the plaintiff the 175 shares
after the loans sought to be <span style="">se­</span>cured by those shares had been paid out of the proceeds of the
insurance policy of the late Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined carefully the allegations in
both the original complaint and the amended complaint, and We <span style="">find that the
amended complaint simply made clearer the <span style="">basis </span></span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">claim </span><span style="">of the plaintiff against the defend­ants in the original complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, it is alleged in
the original complaint that in making the defendant Virginia G. Palma a
co-assignee of the proceeds of the insurance policy of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>, the "defendants knew that Virginia </span><span style="">G. </span><span style="">Palma who was not a relative of the insured was included as one of the
assignees in the deed of assignment </span><span style="">because she was </span><span style="">the wife and partner of defendant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Palma to whom the insured and plaintiff were
obligated, so that defend­ants may have <span style="">additional

other words, in the original complaint, plaintiff had made it understood that
the only reason for including the defendant <span style="">Virginia </span></span><span style="">G. </span><span style="">Palma as co-<span style="">assignee </span>of
the proceeds of the insurance policy of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lyne­vitche</span>

"the defendants have acknow­ledged and agreed with the plaintiff that
herein defend­ant Virginia G. Palma's interest as a co-assignee on the proceeds
of the said insurance policy </span><span style="">was
</span><span style="">up to the <span style="">extent </span>of the total amount of the

out of the proceeds of the insurance policy of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>
defendant <span style="">Virginia </span>G. Palma was
not entitled to more than the amount that was necessary to pay for the loans
and advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like­wise, in the original
complaint the plaintiff was demand­ing from the defendants the return of the
175 shares of stock, and in the amended complaint she made her claim for the
return of those shares of stock clearer by alleg­ing that those shares of stock
had been endorsed to her prior to the death of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lynevitche</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is,
</span>there­fore, no introduction of a new cause of action, contrary to the
finding of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most the
amend­ments were introduced in order to have a more <span style="">accurate </span></span><span style="">statement,
an </span><span style="">amplification,
or </span><span style="">clarification of the averments

</span></span><span style="">Since the amendments introduced

complaint, and did not in any way change or alter plaintiff's cause of action,
the amended complaint should not have been <span style="">dis­</span>missed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the other
additional ground given by the lower court in dismissing the amended complaint,
that the action is based on an agreement which involves the amount of
