				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Pedro <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> seeks the
review on certiorari of a decision of the Court of Appeals affirming that of
the Court of First Instance of Manila, which found him guilty of the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> through falsification of a public document
and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty ranging from two (2) years and four
(4) months to four (4) years, nine (9) months and eleven (11) days of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>,
to pay a fine of P3,000.00 and to indemnify the offended party in the sum of
P3,200.00, with sub­sidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, which shall not
ex­ceed one year, as well as to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> is one of the owners pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> of a parcel of land known as Lot No. 6181 of the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Estate, contain­ing an area of 24.7591 hectares, more
or less, located in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mun­icipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His co-owners are Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>, David <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> and Tomas
<span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Purport­ing to act on their behalf, pursuant to <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B, a power of attorney in his favor, on <st1:date year="1958" day="5" month="5">May
 5, 1958</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> secured from Vicente <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span>, in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
a loan of P3,200.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To guarantee its
payment, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> executed, on said date, on his
behalf and that of his co-owners, the deed of mortgage, Exhibit C, on said
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hav­ing reached the conclusion
that Exhibit B had been falsified, the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
refused, however, to register Exhibit C.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon preliminary investigation, conducted in the office of the City
Fiscal of Manila, co-owners <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> testified and subscribed to affidavits stating that
they had not authorized <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> to mortgage the
aforementioned property; that the signatures on Exhibit B purporting to be
theirs are not their genuine signatures; and that they had never appeared
before any notary public to acknowledge a power of attorney in favor of <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1959</st1:date>, the City Fiscal of
Manila filed, with the Court of First Instance thereof, an information charging
petitioner with the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> through
falsification of a public document, to the damage and prejudice of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span> in the sum of P3,200.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, under a plea of not guilty, said Court rendered
the aforementioned decision of conviction, which was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for
review on certiorari, to which We have given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>
maintains, in his brief, that the Court of Ap­peals has erred in not acquitting
him "under the rule that convic­tion of an accused person lies only when
the proof has established his guilt beyond reasonable doubt."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the evidence for the prosecution consisted of
the testimony of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Racelis</span> <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span> and
Pedro de Guzman, and Exhibits A to E.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
According to <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, the signature on Exhibit B
reading Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> is not his signature, the
genuine one being that which ap­pears in his affidavit before the office of the
City Fiscal of Manila, marked Exhibit E, and he had never appeared before any
notary public to acknowledge a power of attorney in favor of <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> or authorized him to mortgage his (<span class="SpellE">Rosete's</span>) share of the property adverted to above or
execute on his behalf the deed of real estate mortgage, Exhibit C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, likewise, stated that the signature on
Exhibit B reading Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> is not the
latter's sig­nature, his (Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan's</span>) true
signature being that appear­ing on Exhibit D, which was affixed by <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> in his (<span class="SpellE">Rosete's</span>)
presence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Racelis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span> testified that, early in May, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>, accompanied by Pedro de Guzman, a Mr. <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span> and one Mr. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>,
went to her house at No. 458 <span class="SpellE">Maganda</span> St., Sta. Mesa,
Manila, and applied from her husband Vicente <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span>
- who died in 1963 - for a loan, to be guaran­teed by a mortgage on the land
above-mentioned; that <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> then produced the power
of attorney, Exhibit B, purporting to attest to his authority to mortgage said
land, on his behalf and that of his co-owners; that, a few days later, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span> agreed to lend P3,200.00, which he and said
witness delivered, in their aforementioned house, to <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>,
upon the execution of the deed of real estate mortgage, Exhibit C; and that
said sum of P3,200.00 has not, as yet, been paid back.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caragao's</span> version is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On or about <st1:date year="1958" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1958</st1:date>, a son of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>,
named <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>, who
wanted to buy a truck, asked him, in <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, to obtain a P3,000.00 loan
to be guaranteed by the parcel of land above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cara­gao</span> answered
that it might be necessary to get the advice of his co-owners, whereupon <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> replied that he
would work it out with them, later to come back and let him know about the re­sult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> had done
so, or on April 5, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> and his co-owners,
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>,
had met in the barrio of San Vicente, during the local <u>fiesta</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he conveyed <span class="SpellE">Pio's</span>
wish to them, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> said that they had already been informed about
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About two (2) weeks later, or on
April 20, 1958, while <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> was in a barber shop,
near his house, in <span class="SpellE">Sabatan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pio</span> came, bringing with him the special power of
attorney, Exhibit B, stating that his father had given it to him (<span class="SpellE">Pio</span>) and affirmed that the signatures appearing thereon are
those of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>, David <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>
and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pio</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> to
accompany him to mortgage the land and then brought him to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Garcia</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
where one by the name of <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>, an acquaintance
of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, had his office, stating that <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span> would take care of mortgaging the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>,
who subsequently brought them to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> asked a
P4,000.00 loan from the latter, who, in turn agreed to lend the sum of
P3,200.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of this amount, P1,800.00 was
delivered to <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>, in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>, to whom <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> turned the money over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, how­ever, gave
P200.00 to <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>, by way of compensation for his
services as attorney-in-fact, and kept the balance of P1,600.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Carlos de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, a barber, would
have Us believe that, while he was cutting the hair of <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>,
in his (De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes') barber shop, sometime in March
or April, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>
came; that <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> inquired from <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
whether everything was alright; that <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> answered
that "all the documents were already prepared," and then handed to <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> three (3) sheets of paper; and that, on top thereof
was Exhibit B, on which he noticed the signatures of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> and Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying in rebuttal, Pedro de Guzman declared that he did not
know <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> until he was brought to his (De
Guzman's) house by <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>; that they said their purpose was to
obtain a P4,000.00 loan, guaranteed by a mortgage on the property above
referred to, the title to which was brought by <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>;
that he (De Guzman) approached <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> Vicente <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span>, who eventually agreed to lend P3,200.00; that <span class="SpellE">Salan­danan</span> first delivered P650.00, then P850.00, later
P350.00, and lastly P1,350.00, in his house, in Manila; that in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City, where the deed of mortgage was sought to be
registered, they were told that this could not be done because the power of
attorney Exhibit B "was falsified"; and that, upon his (De Guzman's)
return to Manila, <span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span> informed him that the
last payment of P1,350.00 had been made to <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>,
who had told him that the mortgage was already registered.</p>

<p class="BODY">After going over the evidence, the trial Judge, Honorable Luis B.
Reyes, found <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> guilty, beyond reasonable doubt,
of the crime charged and rendered judgment against him as stated at the
beginning of this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
judgment was affirmed by a special division of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for review on
certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> maintains that the decision
appealed from is erroneous because the alleged forgery of the signatures of
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>,
on Exhibit B, has not been duly established, inasmuch as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the prosecution had not introduced the
testimony of the latter or that of <span class="SpellE">Rosete's</span> wife, <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Belarde</span>, notwithstanding
the fact that what purports to be her signature appears in said document, to
indicate her consent thereto; and (2) the uncorroborated testimony of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> is insufficient to offset the presumption of
regularity in the execution of Exhi­bit B, arising from the circumstance that
the same appears to have been notarized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not impressed by this argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question whether <span class="SpellE">Rosete's</span> supposed
signature on Exhibit B has been forged or not is mainly a physical fact, which
does not depend upon the existence of testimonial evidence in cor­roboration of
that of <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the signature in question were
actually that of <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, no amount of such corro­boration
could alter this fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither would any
testimonial evidence to the contrary, which would merely prove the lack of vera­city
of the witnesses who had given such evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the samples of the signature of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, appearing on Exhibit E, the genuineness of which
samples is not contested, <u>corroborate</u> his testimony to the effect that
the signa­ture on Exhibit B, purporting to be that of said witness, is not his
true signature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, the deed of mortgage Exhibit C has not been registered
in the office of the <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Register of Deeds
of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, for the reason that said Exhibit B had
been found to be counterfeit or falsified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, the failure to introduce the testimony of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, and that of the other persons who purportedly
partici­pated in the execution of Exhibit B, should not be taken against the
prosecution, not only because that testimony would be corro­borative in nature,
but, also, because said witnesses were, like­wise, available to the defense,
which could have, and would have surely, called them to the witness stand had
it expected them to testify in favor of <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fifthly, although Exhibit B purports to have been nota­rized, the
defense has not even tried to prove that it has really been attested to by a
notary public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>
has neither identi­fied the latter's supposed signature nor introduced his
testimony, or that of any person, regarding the acknowledgment of said instru­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the presumption of due execution of a
public docu­ment has not attached thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the determination of this case in the court of first
instance, as well as in the Court of Appeals, was mainly dependent upon the
credence given and the weight attached to the evidence introduced by both
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of said evidence is
such, however, that, if the court did not believe that of the defense, the
conviction of <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> would follow necessarily, which
is exactly what happened in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the majority of the members of its
special division that affirmed the decision of the trial court found themselves
unable to accept defend­ant's story as truthful, because:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->During the investigation, in the office of the
City Fis­cal of Manila, before the filing of the information in this case, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> did not say that Exhibit B had been merely
delivered to him by <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>,
already signed by its supposed makers and attested to by a notary public, as
testified to by him (<span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>) in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he cause <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> to be summoned to said office, to testify on
his (<span class="SpellE">Caragao's</span>) behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, when the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
arrested him in connection with this case, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>
did not inform said official of the intervention he now claims <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> had in securing
Exhibit B and the mortgage evidenced by Exhibit C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the alleged partici­pation of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> therein was not
revealed by <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> to anybody, until he took the
witness stand, in the court of first instance, during the trial of this case in
1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact acquires added
importance when we consider that <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> <u>died</u> in 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>
did not implicate <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>
until after death had sealed his lips, or about four (4) years subsequently to
the institution of the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the record suggests strongly that <span class="SpellE">Caragao's</span>
present version is but an eleventh hour devise resorted to, taking advantage of
the fact that <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>
is no longer in a position to contradict him (<span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>
shows that <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>, the broker who placed them in
contact with Pedro de Guzman, who, in turn, knew the money lender, was <u>not</u>
his (<span class="SpellE">Caragao's</span>) acquaint­ance, but <u>that of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> said,
according to <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>, that <span class="SpellE"><u>Malasarte</u></span>
would "take care" of securing the mort­gage loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, there was no reason why <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> had to be made the attorney-in-fact of his
co-owners, instead of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>,
or his own father, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salandanan</span> and Pedro de Guzman have established the
fact that, contrary to petitioner's testimony, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span> was not present when the <span class="SpellE">Salandanans</span>
deli­vered the money to <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span> and that the latter
was then accompa­nied by <span class="SpellE">Malasarte</span>, Guzman and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent that the refusal of the Court of Appeals to
give credence to the theory of the defense is substantially sup­ported by the
surrounding circumstances and the evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, this being a petition for review on
certiorari of a decision of the Court of Appeals, rendered in the exercise of
its exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the decision of the trial court, said
decision of the Court of Appeals is "final," subject only to our
power of review on questions of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> The question of credibi­lity of
testimonial evidence is not such a question of law, and, hence, the finding
thereon of the Court of Appeals is <u>not</u> <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
by Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the testimony of defense witness, Carlos de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, is so <span class="SpellE">artificious</span> as
to reveal clearly his lack of vera­city.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, as His Honor, the trial Judge, had correctly pointed out in his
decision, having used the forged document, Exhibit B, <span class="SpellE">Caragao</span>
is presumed to be its forger.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>
