				<H3>JUAN VERA, EXPEDITO SERRANO AND ROMEO PLANTADO, PETITIONERS, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, COURT OF APPEALS AND COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAMARINES SUR, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners Juan Vera, <span class="SpellE">Expedito</span> Serrano
and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Plantado</span>, in this special proceeding for
certiorari, would have this Court set aside, for being null and void, the
decision of the respondent Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1969</st1:date> finding them guilty of the crime of
homicide and thus affirming, with modification, the judgment of conviction
rendered by the respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> dated <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="7">July
 25, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was likewise named respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
alleged nullity of the two above decisions is predicated on the fact that as of
the time the decision of the respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> was promulgated and
read to petitioners on August 23, 1966, the judge who rendered and signed it,
the Honorable Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span>, had ceased to hold
office as of July 31, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
would thus rely on Jimenez v. Republic<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as the earlier case of People v. Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
as authority for the view that a decision promulgated by the judge who prepared
it after he had left the bench could have no binding effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="11">November
 18, 1969</st1:date>, we required respondents to answer the above petition for
certiorari filed four days earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the meanwhile, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, who was himself likewise
an accused in the above criminal case and likewise convicted in the same
decision of respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, as affirmed by the respondent Court of Appeals,
filed on December 17, 1969 a motion for leave to intervene, joining the other
petitioners in nullifying and setting aside such judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After several extensions, respondents filed a
manifestation on <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1970</st1:date>
to the effect that they shared the view of the petitioners that the
promulgation of the judgment of conviction complained of was null and void, and
prayed that they be relieved from filing an answer to this petition which, in
their opinion, "is meritorious." Two days thereafter, they again
manifested the same view insofar as the motion of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> was concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the above, this petition is
now ripe for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that petitioners' stand, considered purely
from the legal question raised, is not without doctrinal support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As was held in People v.
Court of Appeals:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We have then
that, legally, the decisions of Judge <span class="SpellE">Mañalac</span> were
promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="3" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 3, 1954</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, because he had left the Bench
before that date, his decisions have no binding effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Jimenez v. Republic, the other case cited by petitioners, quoted extensively
from <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
including the following decisive portion of the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Here, in the present case, when the
notice for the promulgation of the decision was sent out, the judge who signed
the decision was no longer the judge of the court, and no copy of the judgment
of acquittal was delivered to the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With more reasons, therefore, is there no judgment validly entered in
this case."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If, therefore, the disposition of this case were made to depend
solely on the above principle thus enunciated by us, petitioners' efforts would
not be in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a decisive <span class="GramE">fact,</span> however, that removes this case from its
operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the decision by the
respondent Court of First Instance dated July 25, 1966, at a time when the then
Judge <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span> still could validly render judgment,
although promulgated on August 23, 1966 after his retirement, an appeal was
taken to respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The brief for petitioners Juan Vera and <span class="SpellE">Expedito</span>
Serrano assigned five errors as having been committed by the respondent Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No jurisdictional question was included among
such alleged errors committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
separate brief was filed by <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, one of the accused likewise convicted by the
respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sur</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> He
imputed five errors as having been committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, he did not raise the issue of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Romeo <span class="SpellE">Plantado</span>
likewise appealed and on his part sought the reversal of the lower court
decision by alleging that three errors vitiated it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, there was no attack on its validity
based on the ground that in the meanwhile, before <span class="GramE">promulgation,</span>
the judge who penned it had retired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then <span class="GramE">came</span> the decision of respondent
Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable why respondent Court of
Appeals was not called upon to discuss any juris­dictional question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the present petitioners,
including the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>,
filed a petition for certiorari before us on <st1:date year="1969" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1969</st1:date> to review the aforesaid decision of
respondent Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Three legal questions were raised in such petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May the Court of Appeals
allow the filing by a private prosecutor of another <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief which is contrary to the recommendation of the Solicitor General in an
appealed criminal case?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May the trial court properly block the
presentation by the accused of evidence for his valid defense?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May
a judgment of conviction rest on proof not beyond reasonable doubt? "What
is clearly noticeable is the absence of any allegation that the decision of the
lower court suffered from a jurisdictional defect as Judge <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span>
had retired prior to its promulgation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On July 9, 1969 the aforesaid petition for certiorari was denied
according to the following resolution issued by us:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Considering the allegations of, and the
issues raised in, the petition for review on certiorari of the decision of the
Court of Appeals referred to therein, [the Court resolved] to deny the
petition, there being no sufficient showing that the decision sought to be
reviewed is not <span style="">supported </span>by
substantial evidence." Two motions for reconsideration were thereafter
filed, one on behalf of all the petitioners <span style="">and </span>the other on behalf of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> alone, but as before, there was no
objection interposed as to the <span style="">lower </span>court
decision suffering from jurisdictional <span style="">infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our </span>resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1969</st1:date>, we denied both
motions for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above facts, the question that presents
itself is whether petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> could
still raise the question that Judge <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span> having
retired previous to the promulgation of the sentence, it must be declared
null.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that they cannot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion finds support in the doctrine
announced in <span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The facts of this case show that from the time the Surety became a
quasi-party on July 31, 1948, it could have raised the question of the lack of
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
to take cognizance of the present action by reason of the sum of money involved
which, according to the law then in force, was within the original exclusive
jurisdiction of inferior courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, at several
stages of the proceedings in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> as well as in the
Court of Appeals, it invoked the jurisdiction of said courts to obtain
affirmative relief and submitted its case for a final adjudication on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after an adverse
decision was rendered by the Court of Appeals that it finally woke up to raise
the question of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were we to
sanction such conduct on its part, We would in effect be declaring as useless
all the proceedings had in the present case since it was commenced on July 19,
1948 and compel the judgment creditors to go up their Calvary once more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inequity and unfairness of this is not
only present but revolting."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, three other decisions were rendered by us in
reliance on the above <span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> doctrine:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> v. Allied
Workers' Association of the Phil.;<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and Rodriguez v. Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, in an even earlier case, Francisco v. City of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, a 1964 decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through the then Justice, now Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, already served notice on litigants that after a
certain stage, if it would result in a failure of justice, a jurisdictional
question, even on its face meritorious, would not necessarily be accorded the
decisiveness that it might <span class="GramE">ordinarily</span> possess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The ends of justice would not be served, if we now dismiss the
case - over nine (9) years after it had been initiated - and bade the
plaintiffs to start all over again, following thee procedure that the
defendants had asked the lower court, but which the latter refused, to
require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, since the legal
question raised in the pleadings has reached this Court, and the assessment
complained of is manifestly <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the clear
and express provision of the law, it is best that we decide said question,
instead of further deferring its resolution."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the conclusion reached by us open to the objection that
the principle we deem controlling was announced in suits civil in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of itself, such a distinction
does not suffice to call for a different result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would constitute an insuperable obstacle
to its application to a criminal prosecution and the judgment thereafter
rendered is if thereby, to paraphrase the present Chief Justice, the ends of
justice would not be served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, if
such were the case, a due process question would undoubtedly arise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would be a disregard of this
constitutional safeguard if the governmental action taken is found offensive to
a principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people
as to be ranked as fundamental.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In criminal proceedings due process would require that the accused be informed
as to why he is proceeded against and what charge he has to meet, with his
conviction being made to rest on evidence that is not tainted with falsity
after full opportunity for him to rebut it and the sentence being imposed in
accordance with a valid law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is assumed, of course, that the court that renders the
sentence is one of competent jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is an admitted fact in this case that respondent Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
presided by the then Judge Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Surtida</span>, was
vested with jurisdiction to try and decide the case against petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As admitted in this very petition, the
decision reached by him, thereafter affirmed with modification by respondent
Court of Appeals, was "duly rendered and signed" on July 25, 1966 at
a time before his retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had it
been promulgated then and there, this particular question raised in this
petition would not have arisen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
gave it plausibility, as above noted, was that it was not until after his
retirement on August 23, 1966 that such a sentence was read to petitioners. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Considering all the circumstances detailed
above and the <span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> doctrine on which reliance could
be had, it cannot be said that injustice was thereby committed against
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The canons of fairnes<span style="">s </span>are
not thereby set at naught.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
cannot rightfully complain of having been the victims of arbitrary governmental
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were given all the
opportunity to defend themselves not only before the respondent Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
but likewise before respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They tried to have this Court, in an earlier
petition for certiorari, to review the judgment of respondent Court of Appeals,
but they did not meet with success because of their inability to demonstrate
that they failed to receive the protection that due process accords every
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was said by Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> fits the occasion:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The law, as we have seen, is sedulous in maintaining for a
defendant charged with crime whatever forms of procedure are of the essence of
an opportunity to defend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Privileges so
fundamental as to be inherent in every concept of a fair trial that could be
acceptable to the thought of reasonable men will be kept inviolate and <span class="GramE">inviolable,</span> however crushing may be the pressure of
incriminating proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But justice, though
due to the accused, is due to the accuser also.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The concept of fairness must not be <span style="">strained </span>till it is narrowed to a filament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are to keep the balance true."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
