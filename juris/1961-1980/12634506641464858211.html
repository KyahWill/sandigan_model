				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is an original action for certiorari and mandamus against
Judge <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Fidel Fernandez, </span>of the
Court of First Instance of Samar, and Edita Lim.</p>

<p class=BODY>The latter, as well as petitioner Dioscoro V. Astorga, were
candidates for mayor of the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>municipality</st1:PlaceType>
 <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>of </span><st1:PlaceName>Daram</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,
<st1:place>Samar</st1:place>, during the elections held on <st1:date Year="1963"
Day="12" Month="11">November 12, 1963</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two (2) days later, Lim was proclaimed
elected to <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>said office with a plurality
of </span>forty (40) votes over her clos­<span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>est opponent, petitioner </span>Astorga, who, on November 27, 1963, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>filed </span>the corresponding election
protest, which was docketed as Special Proceedings No. 4997 of said court,
based upon &quot;irregularities and frauds&quot; allegedly committed in
Precinct No. 12 of Daram where - in the language of the motion pro<span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>test - &quot;the board of inspectors
illegally read and credited in favor of the protestee some eighty (80) ballots
wherein the protestant was voted for as mayor.&quot; Astorga further averred
that, &quot;if the ballot box for Precinct No. 12 is opened and the votes
contained therein recounted and recanvassed x x x the result of the elections
in the whole municipality would be altered and the protestant will have the
plurality of votes in said municipality.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>On December 2, 1963,
respondent Judge, who presided over said court, required Astorga to file a bond
and make a cash deposit, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>as </span>well
as ordered the municipal treasurer of Daram to produce immediately, before the
court, his cop­ies of the registry lists, the ballot boxes, the election
statements, the voters' affidavits and the other documents used in the precinct
aforementioned, in the 1963 elections.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In her answer to the protest, respondent Lim denied the aforementioned
irregularities &quot;for having no knowledge or information as to the
truth&quot; of the allegations thereon, and set up a counter-protest, based
upon irregularities allegedly committed in another precinct of Daram.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>When the case was called
for hearing on </span><st1:date Year="1964" Day="12" Month="2"><span
 style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>February 12, 1964</span></st1:date><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>, Astorga moved to open the ballot box in
said Precinct No. 12, in order to examine the ballots contained therein and
recount the votes cast in said precinct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lim having objected thereto, respondent Judge ruled that the pertinent
allegations in the protest are &quot;sufficient&quot; and that &quot;the box
referred to should be opened, <u>but</u> x x x </span><u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>only when the court
is convinced that there really exists that irregularity alleged in the protest</span></u><span

hence, denied, in the meantime, said motion of Astorga.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A reconsideration of this ruling having been
denied, Astorga commenced the present original action for certiorari and
mandamus, to annul the orders denying the motion to open said ballot box and
the motion for reconsi­deration, and compel respondent Judge to forthwith
proceed with the opening of said ballot box, for the examination of its
contents, the recounting of the votes, and other appropriate proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;The provisions of Section 175 of the Elec­tion Code

</span><u>The </u><u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>limitations </span>implicit

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Respondents maintain, however,
the opposite view upon the theory that the decisions relied upon by petitioner
were based upon the provisions of the old Election Law,</span><a

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'> We do not find, however, any material
difference between the old and the new law, pertinent to the issue under
considera­tion, to justify the conclusion drawn therefrom by respondents
herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Moreover, it is clear to
us that the stand taken by the lower court was extremely technical and highly
imprac­tical, apart from tending to defeat one of the major objec­tives of the
applicable law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The main issue raised -
adequately or sufficiently, according to respondent Judge - in Astorga's
protest </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'>whether or not &quot;the board of election inspectors (had) read and
credited in favor of the protestee some eighty (80) ballots wherein the
protestant was voted for mayor.&quot; Obviously the simplest, the most
expeditious and the best means to determine the truth or falsity of this
allegation <span class=GramE>is</span> to open the ballot box and examine its
contents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To re­quire parol or other
evidence on said alleged irregularity before opening said box, would have
merely given the protestee ample opportunity to delay the settlement of the
controversy, through lengthy cross-examination of the wit­nesses for the
protestant and the presentation of testimo­nial evidence for the protestee to
the contrary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As held in Cecilio vs.
Belmonte (<u>supra</u>), this &quot;would be to sanction an easy way to defeat
a protest.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Indeed, had the box in question been opened, the exami­nation of
its contents - particularly, that of no more than eighty (80) ballots for
Astorga, allegedly read and credited in favor of Lim - could have been
completed in one (1) or two (2) hours.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Instead, the action taken by respondent Judge has delayed the
disposition of the protest for over three (3) years, or 80% of the term of the
office involved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, the lower court
had committed not only an error of judgment, but, also, a grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders complained of are hereby set aside
and respondent Judge is directed to immediately open the bal­lot box in
question and proceed with the examination of its contents, in accordance with
law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Costs against
respondent Edita Lim.</span></p>
