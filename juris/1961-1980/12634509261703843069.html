  City</st1:place></st1:city>) dismissing plaintiff's complaint on the ground
that it states no cause of action, and discharging <span class="GramE">the</span>
writ of preliminary attachment issued therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1962</st1:date>,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Acuña</span>
filed a complaint, which was later amended on August 13, against the defendant <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> Producers Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc.,
hereinafter called the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>,
Inc., or alternatively, against all the other defendants named in the
caption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint alleges, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that on or about May 5, 1962 it was tentatively
agreed upon between plaintiff and defendant Leon Q. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>,
as Manager of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>,
Inc., that the former would seek and obtain the sum of not less than P20,000.00
to be advanced to the defendant <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>, Inc., to be utilized by it as additional funds for
its Virginia tobacco buying operations during the current <span class="SpellE">redrying</span>
season; that plaintiff would be constituted as the corporation’s representative
in Manila to assist in handling and facilitating its continuous shipments of
tobacco and their delivery to there <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plants
and in speeding up the prompt payment and collection of all amounts due to the
corporation for such shipments; that for his services plaintiff would be paid a
remuneration at the rate of P0.50 per kilo of tobacco; that said tentative
agreement was favorably received by the Board of Directors of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>, Inc., and on May
6, 1962 all the defendants named above, who constituted the entire Board of
Directors of said corporation (except Leon Q. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>,
who was its Manager), together with de­fendants <span class="SpellE">Justino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, as President and Vice-President, respectively,
unanimously authorized defendant Leon Q. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, by a
formal resolutions "to execute any agreement with any person or entity, on
be­half of the corporation, for the purpose of securing ad­ditional funds for
the corporation, as well as to secure the services of such person or entity, in
the collection of all payments due to the corporation from the PVTA for any
tobacco sold and delivered to said administration; giving and conferring upon the
Manager, full and complete authority to bind the corporation with such person
or entity in any agreement, and under such considerations, which the said
Manager may deem expedient and necessary for that purpose; that plaintiff was
made to understand by all of said defendants that the original understanding
between him and defendant Leon Q. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> was
acceptable to the corporation, except that the remuneration for the plaintiff’s
services would be P0.30 per kilo of tobacco; that on May 10, 1962, the formal
"Agreement" was executed between plaintiff and defendant Leon Q. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, as Manager of the defendant corporation, duly
authorized<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by its Board of Directors for
such purpose, and signed by defendants <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> <span class="SpellE">Galano</span> and Dr. Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Bumanglag</span>
as instrumental witnesses and acknowledged by Atty. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, the Secretary and Legal Counsel of the defendant
corporation; that upon plaintiff's inquiry, he was assured by these defendants
that a formal approval of said "Agree­ment" by the Board was no
longer necessary, as it was a mere "formality" appended to its
authorizing resolution and as all the members of the Board had already agreed
to the same; that on the same date, May 10, 1962, plain­tiff gave and turned
over to the defendant corporation, thru its treasurer, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
T. <span class="SpellE">Cocson</span>, the sum of P20,000.00, in the presence of
defendants Leon Q. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Justino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galano</span>, Dr. Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Bumanglag</span>
and Atty. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, for which said
treasurer issued to plaintiff its corresponding Official Receipt No. 130852;
that from then on, plaintiff diligently and religiously kept his part of the
"Agreement"; that plaintiff even furnished the defendant corporation,
upon request of its Manager Leon Q. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span>, three
thousand (3,000) sacks which it utilized in the <span class="SpellE">shipmart</span>
of its tobacco costing P6,000.00 and that plaintiff had personally advanced out
of his own personal funds the total sum of P5,000.00 with the full knowledge,
acquiescence and consent of all the individual defendants; that after the
defendant corporation was enabled to replenish its funds with continuous
collections from the PVTA for tobacco delivered due to the help, assistance and
intervention of plaintiff, for which the said corporation collected from the
PVTA the total sum of P381,495.00, the "Agreement" was disapproved by
its Board of Directors on June 6, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the foregoing allegations plaintiff prays: (a) that an order of
attachment be issued against the properties of defendant corporation; (b) that
after due trial; judgment be rendered condemning defendant corporation, or
alternatively, all the other individual defendants, jointly and severally, to
comply with their contractual obligations and to pay plaintiff the sum of P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for his services, plus P31,000.00 for cash advances
made by him and P25,000.00 for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1962</st1:date>,
the lower court ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment
against the properties of the defendants and on the following day, after the
plaintiff had posted the required bond, the writ was accordingly issued by the
Clerk of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1962</st1:date>,
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it
stated no cause of action and to discharge the preliminary attachment on the
ground that it was improperly or irregu­larly issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of the motion defendants al­leged
that the contract for services was never perfected because it was not approved
or ratified but was instead disapproved by the Board of Directors of defendant <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>, Inc., and that on
the basis of plaintiff's plead­ings the contract is void and
unenforceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants further denied
the fact that plaintiff had performed his part of the contract, alleging that
he had not in any manner intervened in the delivery and payment of tobacco
pertaining to the defendant corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1962</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed a written opposition to the motion to dismiss and to discharge
the preliminary attachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1962</st1:date>,
the trial court sustained defendants' motion and issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"In resume, the Court believes that the complaint states no
cause of action and that the contract in question is void <span class="SpellE">ab</span>
<span class="SpellE">initio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the amended complaint filed in this case
is hereby ordered DISMISSED, without special pronouncement as to costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the writ of preliminary
attachment issued herein is ordered discharged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it is of record that the defendants has (sic) deposited the
Court the amount of P20,400.00 representing the amount of money in­vested by
the plaintiff plus the corresponding interest thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, by virtue of this order, may
withdraw the same in due time, if he so desires, upon proper receipt <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing order plaintiff interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant has assigned four errors, which we shall consider
seriatim:</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment reads.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"As the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint and discharge
the preliminary attachment was based on the specific ground that the complaint states
no cause of action (Sec. 1 (f), Rule 8, Rules of Court), the lower court should
not have gone beyond, and it should have limited itself, to the facts alleged
in the complaint in considering and resolving said motion to dismiss."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled principle that when a motion to dismiss is based
on the ground that the complaint does not state a cause of action (Rule 8,
Section 1, par. 7 of the old Rules; Rule 16, Section 1, par (g) of the Revised
Rules) the averments in the complaint are deemed hypothetically admitted and
the inquiry is limited to whether or not they make out a case on which relief
can be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said motion assails
directly or indirectly the veracity of the allegations, it is improper to grant
the motion upon the assumption that the averments therein are true and those of
the complaint are not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Prov</span>. Board <span class="GramE">of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> 52 O.G. 6557</span>.) The
sufficiency of the motion should be tested on the strength of the allegations
of facts con­tained in the complaint, and no other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these allegations show a cause of action,
or furnish sufficient basis by which the complaint can be maintained, the
complaint should not be dismissed regardless of the defenses that may be
averred by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> de Jesus, et al. vs. Santos <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, 50 O.G., 3004-3068; <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Rigonan</span>, G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-6459,
</span><st1:date year="1954" day="23" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 23,
 1954</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>, 51 O. G. 2397-2400.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first ground upon which the order of dismissal issued by the
lower court is predicated is that the Board of Directors of <span class="GramE">defendant
corporation</span> did not approve the agreement in question - in fact
disapproved it by a resolution passed on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="6">June
 6, 1962</st1:date> - and that as a consequence the "<span class="SpellE">suspensive</span>
condition" attached to the agreement was never fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The specific stipulation referred to by the
Court as a <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span> condition states:
"provided, however, that the contract entered into by said manager to
carry out the purposes above-mentioned shall be subject to the approval of the
Board.”</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the complaint reveals that it contains sufficient
allegations indicating such approval or at least subsequent ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first point we note the following
averments: that on May 9th the plaintiff met with each and all of the
individual defendants (who constituted the entire Board of Directors) and
discussed with them extensively the tentative agreement and he was made to
understand that it was acceptable to them, except as to plaintiff's
remuneration; that it was finally agreed between plaintiff and all said
Directors that his remuneration would be P0.30 per kilo (of tobacco); and that
after the agreement was formally executed he was assured by said Directors that
there would be no need of formal approval by the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted in this connection that
although the contract required such approval it did not specify just in what
manner the same should be given.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of ratification the complaint alleges that
plaintiff delivered to the defendant corporation the sum of P20,000.00 as
called for in the contract; that he rendered the services he was required to
do; that he furnished said defendant 3,000 sacks at a cost of P6,000.00 and
advanced to it the further sum of P5,000.00; and that he did all of these
things with the full knowledge, acquiescence and consent of each and all of the
individual defendants who constitute the Board of Directors of the defendant
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is abundant authority
in support of the proposition that ratification may be ex­press or implied, and
that implied ratification may take diverse forms, such as by silence or
acquiescence; by acts showing approval or adoption of the contract; or by
acceptance and retention of benefits flowing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly the very resolution of the Board of Directors
relied upon by defendants' aspects to militate against their contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It refers to plaintiff's failure to comply
with certain promises he had made, as well as to his interpretation of the
contract with respect to his remuneration which, according to the Board, was
contrary to the intention of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The resolution then proceeds to “disapprove and/or rescind" the
said contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea of conflicting
interpretation, or of rescission on the ground that one of the parties has
failed to fulfill his obligations under the contract, is certainly in­compatible
with defendants' theory here that no contract had yet been perfected for lack
of approval by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' second assignment of error reads: "Assuming that
in resolving the defendants' motion to dismiss the lower court could consider
the new facts al­leged therein and the documents annexed thereto it com­mitted
an error in extending such consideration beyond ascertaining only if an issue
of fact has been presented and in actually deciding instead such fact in
issue."</p>

<p class="BODY">The assignment is well taken, and is the logical <span class="SpellE">corrolary</span> of the rule that a motion to dismiss on the
ground that the complaint fails to state a cause of action addresses itself to
the averments in the complaint and, admitting their veracity, merely questions
their sufficiency to make out a case on which the court can grant relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Affidavits, such as those presented by
defendants in support of the motion, can only <span class="GramE">be</span>
considered for the purpose of ascertaining whether an issue of fact is presented,
but not as a basis for de­ciding the factual issue itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should await the trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third assignment of error assails the lower court's ruling
that even assuming that a contract had been perfected no action can be
maintained thereon because its object was illegal and therefore void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specific reference was made by said court to
an affidavit executed by appellant on May 10, 1962 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That I, EMILIANO ACUÑA, the party of the Second Part in the
con­tract entered into with the <span class="SpellE">Batac</span> <span class="SpellE">Procoma</span>, Inc., the party of the First Part in same contract
declares that the amount of P0.30 per kilo is referred to upgraded tobacco only
as delivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This supplements paragraph
three of the contract re­ferred to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Deliveries downgraded or maintained at the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span>
plant are deemed not included." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, in its order of dismissal, held that "the <u>upgrading</u>
of tobaccos is clearly prohibited under our laws, and hence the contract cannot
be validly ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently the court
had in mind a fraudulent <u>upgrading</u> of tobacco by appellant as part of
the services called for under the contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This conclusion, however, is squarely traversed by appellant in another
affidavit attached to his reply and opposition to the motion to dismiss, in
which he explained the circumstances which led to the execution of the one
relied upon by the court; and the real meaning of the word "upgraded"
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therein stated:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"That after the execution of the agreement.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex "B" to the amended com­plaint
in said Civil Case No, Q-6547), Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> <span class="SpellE">Galano</span> and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bumanglag</span> of the
defendant Corporation indicated to me that if the price of P0.30 per kilo
stipulated there to be paid to me were to be indiscriminately ap­plied to all
deliveries of tobac­cos, the Corporation would be placed in a disadvantageous
and losing position and they proceeded to explain to me the following, -</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(a) that when the farmers
sell their tobaccos to the <span class="SpellE">Facoma</span>, they do so in
bunches of assort­ed qualities which may belong either to Class A<span class="GramE">,B,C,D</span> and E, and upon such purchase they are initially
given an arbitrary classification of any of such classes, as the case may be,
the tendency generally being to give them a lower classifi­cation to equalize
or average the assorted qualities as much<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>as possible, and this is what is termed "downgrading;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) that after the tobaccos have been purchased by the <span class="SpellE">Facoma</span> from the farmers, they are then <span class="SpellE">reassorted</span>
and re-classified in accordance with their actual quali­ty or grade as found by
the off­icials of the <span class="SpellE">Facoma</span>, - thus in a bunch which
are purchased as Class C, D or E, upon reclassification those found to belong
to Class A are separated from Class B, those belonging to class B, are
separated from Class C, and so on, and these bunches so reclassified
necessarily have a higher grade than the original arbitrary classification
given when purchased from the farmers, and this is what termed 'upgrading"
upon delivery which was used in the addendum;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) the <span class="SpellE">Facoma</span> in turn, delivers these
properly re-clas­sified tobaccos to the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span>
plant and there, a group of officials composed of a representative of the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant, the Bureau of Internal Revenue the General
Auditing Office the PVTA and the <span class="SpellE">Facoma</span>
representative, then examines and grades the tobaccos, and if the
classification give to the <span class="SpellE">Facoma</span> is found correct
and not changed, then and only then would or should I be entitled to collect
the P0.30 kilo, and this they said is what termed "grade maintained"
- on the other hand, if these officials found the classification incorrect and
lowers the classification given by the <span class="SpellE">Facoma</span>, <span class="SpellE">taus</span> class A to B, or from B to C, than the tobaccos are
considered or said to be "downgraded" and in that event I should not
receive any centavo for such deliveries, and it is in this sense that I was
made to understand the term;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Believing implicitly in the
foregoing explanations of the defendants and in the reasonable­ness of their
proposal, I agreed readily and Atty. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,
Legal Counsel and Secretary of the defendant Cor­poration forthwith prepared,
drafted and typed the "addendum" in question in their own typewriter
of the Corporation; and as I am not a lawyer and was not well versed with the
usage, customs and phraseology usually used in tobacco trading, I relied in
absolute good faith that, as explained by the defendants, there was nothing
wrong nor illegal in the use of the words "upgrading" and
"downgrading" used in said addendum, which Atty. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
unfortunately used in the same;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Apart from the above, defendants knew the physical impossibility of
"upgrading" the tobaccos at the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span>
plant, because at the time of the trans­action, only the PTFC &amp; RC was
allowed to accept tobacco for <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> and under the
existing regulations and practices the delivery area for tobaccos at the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant is enclosed by a high wire fence
inaccessible to the general public and the only ones who actually make the
grading of tobaccos delivered, are the (1) American representative of the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant (PTFC &amp; RC), (2) the PVTA, (3) the BIR
and (4) the General Auditing Office in the presence of the representative of
the FACOMA, and since the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant is compelled
to purchase 41% of all tobaccos delivered and <span class="SpellE">redried</span>
under their negotiated management contract, it is highly improbable that the
representative of the <span class="SpellE">redrying</span> plant (PHFC &amp; RC)
whose conformity to the actual grading done must appear in the corresponding
"<span class="SpellE">guia</span>" or tally sheet, would allow the
"upgrading" of tobaccos, aside from the fact that stringent measures
had been devised under the present administration to prevent the
"upgrading" of tobaccos by any party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, an impossible condition could not have been contemplated by
me and the defendants;" (Record on appeal, pp. 171-175)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing explanation, on its face, is satisfactory and
deprives the term "upgraded" of the sinister and illegal connotation
attributed to it by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
be sure, whether the allegations in this subsequent affidavit are true or not
is a question of fact; but it is precisely for this reason that they can
neither be summarily admitted nor rejected for purposes of a motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due pro­cess demands that they
be the subject of proof and considered only after trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other errors assigned by appellant are merely incidental to
those already discussed, and require no separate treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Wherefore</span></b>,
the order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> for further proceedings, without prejudice to the right of
plaintiff-appellant to ask for another writ of attachment in said court, as the
circumstances may warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</span></p>
