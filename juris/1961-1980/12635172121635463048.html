				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Development
Corporation from an order of dismissal of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>),
predicated upon lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 21, 1963, said plaintiff and defendant Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> entered into a contract whereby the latter bound
himself to construct a reinforced concrete covered water reservoir, office and
pump house and water main at Forbes Park, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, furnishing, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
the materials necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before making the final payment of the
consideration agreed upon, plain­tiff inquired from the suppliers of materials,
who had called its attention to unpaid bills <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>, whether the latter had settled his
accounts with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In response to this
inquiry, Concrete Aggregates, Inc. – hereinafter referred to as the Sup­plier -
made a claim in the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,198.75</span>, representing the
cost of transit-mixed concrete allegedly delivered to <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his consent, plaintiff withheld said
amount from the final payment made to him and, in <span style="">view </span>of his subsequent failure to settle the issue thereon with
the Supplier, on <st1:date year="1955" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1955</st1:date>,
plaintiff instituted the present action, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, against <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> and the
Supplier, to compel them "to interplead their conflicting claims."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> moved to dismiss the case, upon the ground
that the court had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the litigation,
the amount involved therein being less than P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Finding this motion "to be well-taken", the lower court granted the
same, over plaintiff's opposition thereto, and, accordingly, issued an order,
dated <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1965</st1:date>, <span style="">dismissing </span>the case, without
costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal, in which
plaintiff main­tains that the subject-matter of this litigation is, not the
aforemen­tioned sum of P5<span class="GramE">,198.75</span>, but the right to
compel the defendants "to litigate among themselves" in order to
protect the plaintiff "against a double vexation in respect to one
liability."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question in this case that
plaintiff may compel the defendants to interplead among themselves, concerning
the aforementioned sum of P5<span class="GramE">,198.75</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only issue is who among the defendants is
entitled to collect the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the object of the action, which is not within the juris­diction of the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, on May 25,
1966, the Supplier sued <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>, in Civil Case No.
149173 of the Municipal Court of Manila, for the recovery of said amount of
P5,198.75, and the decision therein will settle the question as to who has a <span style="">right to </span>the sum withheld by plaintiff
herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter relies upon Rule 63 of the present Rules of Court,
prescribing the procedure in cases of interpleading, and section 19 of Rule 5 of
said Rules of Court, which, unlike section 19 of Rule 4 of the Old Rules, omits
the Rules on Interpleading among those made applicable to inferior courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact does not warrant, however, the
conclusion drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by plaintiff herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the jurisdiction of our courts
over the subject-matter of <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversies
is governed by Rep. Act No. 296, as amended, pur­suant to which<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
municipal courts shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil cases
"in which the demand, exclusive of interest, or the value of the property
in controversy" amounts to not more than ‘'ten thousand pesos."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, "the power to define,
prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts" belongs
to Congress<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> and is beyond the rule-making
power of the Supreme Court, which is limited to matters "concerning
pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, and the admission to the
practice of law."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Thirdly,
the failure of said section 19 of Rule 5 of the present Rules of Court to make
its Rule 63, on interpleading, applicable to <span class="SpellE">inferiour</span>
courts, merely implies that the same are not bound to follow Rule 63 in dealing
with cases of interpleading, but may apply thereto the general rules on
procedure applicable to ordinary civil action in said courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with the costs of this instance against plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Development Corporation.</p>
