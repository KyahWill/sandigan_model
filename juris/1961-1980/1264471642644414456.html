become a Filipino citizen in a petition filed before the Court of First Instance 
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental. On <st1:date month="12" day="22" year="1961">December 22, 1961</st1:date>, the court a quo granted the petition 
subject to the two-year limitation provided by law. The government took the 
present appeal.</p>
<p>Petitioner was born in <st1:place><st1:city>Amoy</st1:city>, 
<st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place> on <st1:date month="6" day="1" year="1914">June 1, 1914</st1:date>. He arrived in 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date month="2" day="26" year="1926">February 26, 1926</st1:date> and after one week he went to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental where he resided until January, 1929. He 
surrendered his landing certificate of arrival to the Commissioner of 
Immigration and was issued in its place an immigration certificate of residence. 
Since January, 1929, he has resided at <st1:street><st1:address>Alfonso 
Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>. He finished his seventh grade 
at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bais</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place> and his first year 
high school at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Negros</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Oriental</st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High 
School</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>
<p>He was married to Howa Lu on <st1:date month="10" day="22" year="1950">October 22, 1950</st1:date> before Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>. He has five children 
with her who were all born in <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>, whose names 
and are: Anthony <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, 9 years; Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, 8 years; Annabel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> 6 years; 
Vivian <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, 4 years; and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, 2 years. He is a Roman 
Catholic and all his children were baptized as Catholics, their sponsors being 
all Filipinos. Anthony, Benjamin, Annabel, and Vivian are at present studying at 
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>, an institution recognized by 
the government which teaches Philippine history, civics and government. Said 
school is not limited to students of any race, creed or nationality. Petitioner 
has resided in the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> for 
more than 34 years and has never gone to 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He read 
correctly an excerpt from the first page of the vernacular magazine "<span class="SpellE">Bisaya</span>" and took down some dictation in English correctly 
and translated the same fairly well into the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> 
dialect.</p>
<p>Petitioner owns the building where his store is located in the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> public market. He has been a merchant since 
January, 1950 but before that time he was a salesman for the <span class="SpellE">Du</span> <span class="GramE">An</span> <span class="SpellE">Sim</span> 
Store in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>. In 1958 his income was P4<span class="GramE">,659.88</span>; in 1959 P6,971.27, and in 1960 P7,799.34.</p>
<p>Petitioner claims that he has not committed any crime involving moral 
turpitude. He has conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during 
his entire <span class="GramE">period</span> of residence in the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 
his relation with the government and the community where he resides. He believes 
in the principle underlying the Philippine constitution. He is not opposed to 
organized government. He is not affiliated with any association or group of 
persons which upholds and teaches doctrines subversive to organized government. 
He does not defend or teach the necessity of employing violence, personal 
assault or assassination for the success of men's ideas. He is <span class="GramE">not a polygamist nor</span> a believer in the practice of polygamy. 
He is not suffering from any contagious disease. He is a member of the 
Filipino-Chinese Catholic Association of <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>. He 
is not a communist. He mingles socially with the Filipinos and has evinced a 
sincere desire to learn and embrace the customs, traditions and ideals of the 
Filipinos. He has helped civic, charitable and religious organizations in <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> in their fund campaign drives.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Ligorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Luzada</span> declared 
that he was born in <span class="SpellE">Oslob</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, and has resided in 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> since 1924. He was a market 
inspector in the public market of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for more than 20 years. He had 
known petitioner since 1940 because the latter owns a store in the public market 
of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>. He often goes to see petitioner 
at his store in order to collect cash tickets. He regards petitioner as 
qualified to become a Filipino citizen because he has good moral character, is 
law-abiding, and has no vices. Petitioner is a merchant, helpful and 
cooperative, kind and sympathetic to his Filipino customers and friends. He pays 
all his taxes promptly. He never violated any rule or regulation of the public 
market nor any law or ordinance. He mingles socially with the Filipinos and has 
shown a sincere desire to learn and embrace the customs, traditions and ideals 
of the Filipinos.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Katada</span> also 
declared that he was born in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> where he resided for 44 years. 
He was formerly a councilor of said city but at present he owns a tailoring shop 
at the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> public market. He has known 
petitioner since 1940. He is of good moral character and has no vices. He does 
not discriminate against Filipinos in his business. He has conducted himself in 
a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire stay in the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 
his relation with the duly constituted government, as well as with the community 
in which he resides. He is law-abiding and cooperative with the authorities. He 
mingles socially with the Filipinos by attending parties given by Filipinos and 
inviting his Filipino friends in his home. He finished his first year high 
school at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Negros</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Oriental</st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High 
School</st1:placetype></st1:place> at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>
<p>The government contends that the court <u>a quo</u> erred in granting 
petitioner the privilege of citizenship in the absence of evidence that he has 
conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire period 
of residence in the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 
his relation to the constituted government as well as to the community in which 
he lives.</p>
<p>This contention is well-taken. Our law requires that one who applies for 
Philippine citizenship should support his claim with sworn statements of two 
character witnesses who should attest to the fact that he has all the 
qualifications to become so, one of them being that he is a person of good moral 
character and has conducted himself irreproachably during the entire period of 
his residence in the country. This requirement must be clearly established and 
cannot be left merely to conjecture. And here that situation does not obtain, 
for the two witnesses who testified in his behalf fall short of the competence 
to do so. Thus, both <span class="SpellE">Ligorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Luzada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Katada</span> emphatically declared that they only came to know 
petitioner since 1940 when the evidence clearly shows that he landed in the 
Philippines on February 26, 1926 and resided therein ever since up to the 
present time. There is, therefore, no evidence as regards his good repute and 
behavior from said date until 1040 or during an interval of 14 years-This long 
gap argues eloquently against the qualification of good conduct and behavior 
that the law requires of an applicant for Filipino citizenship.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> since the law 
requires proper and irreproachable conduct during the <u>entire</u> period of 
his residence in the Philippines (Section 2, par. 3, Com. Act 473), the evidence 
falls far short when only two witnesses are presented who came to know applicant 
only in 1945 and 1946 respectively (See <span class="SpellE">Di</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiam</span> v. Republic, L 10200, April 18, 1958), and who were, 
therefore in no position to testify as to applicant's conduct from the time he 
arrived in the Philippines on October 2, 1921. Needless to say, it takes much 
more than the uncorroborated assertions of applicant himself to establish this 
vital fact. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">" (</span>Chua Pun vs. Republic, L-16825, <st1:date month="12" day="22" year="1961">December 22, 1961</st1:date>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Another flaw that we may mention is the lack of sufficient proof to show that 
petitioner has a lucrative occupation within the meaning of the law. Indeed, the 
record shows that petitioner has a wife and five children to support who are all 
minors and of school ape, except young <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>. They 
are, therefore, all dependant upon petitioner who cannot in any manner help him 
in improving his financial position. Yet, his income in 1958 only amounted to 
P4<span class="GramE">,659.88</span>;.in 1959 P6,971.27, and in 1960 P7,799.34, 
which certainly cannot be considered enough to give him a lucrative occupation 
in contemplation of law. In fact, we have already held that income of P5,980.00 
where applicant had a wife and three children (Koa <span class="SpellE">Gui</span> 
vs. Republic, L-13717, July 31, 1962); P6,300.00, where applicant had a wife and 
one child (Tan v. Republic, L-16013, March 30, 1963); P7,133.29 where petitioner 
had a wife and four children (Go Bon The v. Republic, L-16813, December 27, 
1963); and P8,687.50, where applicant had to support a wife and five children 
(<span class="SpellE">Keng</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span> v. Republic, 
L-13347, August 31, 1961), were insufficient to meet the requirement considering 
the high cost of living and the law value of our currency. We are not now in a 
position to adopt a ruling that may set at naught the precedents we have 
heretofore set forth on the matter.</p>
<p>It further appears that the four children of petitioner who are of school age 
are now studying at the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> Chinese School 
which, though recognized by our government, is however a place where most of the 
students are Chinese or foreigners, with Filipinos forming the minority. This is 
another circumstance which argues against the alleged sincere desire of 
petitioner to embrace our customs and traditions, as well as to mingle socially 
with the Filipinos, for he could have enrolled his children in a school owned or 
run by Filipino citizens. As we already said: "Philippine citizenship is a 
privilege that should not easily given away. It should be accorded only to one 
who evinces a true and sincere desire to embrace such citizenship. <span class="GramE">Petitioner falls short of this requirement" (<span class="SpellE">Tochip</span> v. Republic, L-19637, February 26, 1965).</span></p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is hereby 
reversed. <span class="GramE">Costs against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</span></p>
