plaintiff-appellant, through its City Mayor, and defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>

(Cad. <span class="GramE">Case No. <span style="">3, </span>G.L.R.O.
Rec. No. 94) situated in the City of </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Cabanatuan</span></span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style=""> which plaintiff-appellant
owned, by specifically deleting paragraph 6 thereof.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said paragraph gives the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> an
option to renew the lease for another 10 years after the expiration of the
original period, and reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"6. That after
the expiration of the ten (10) years from January 1, 1960, the party of the
second part may, at his option choose to extend this lease for another period
of ten years."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged, among others, that due to mistake or accident, the
aforesaid provision was inserted in the agreement; and that the same does not
reflect the true intention of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is contended that while Resolution No. 1030 of the Municipal Board of
the City of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>, approved on 17 December <span style="">1959,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>authorizes the City Mayor to enter

<p class="BODY">Defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> moved for the
dismissal of the complaint for the reasons that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the action is premature; (b) there is no
cause of action; and (c) the court has no jurisdiction over the subject and
nature of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u><span style="">a quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>granted the motion to dismiss in its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="11">11 November <span style="">1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>finding
the same to be meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant moved to have the order reconsidered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
opposed the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the motion for
reconsideration was pending, defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
manifested to the court that plaintiff-appellant already sold the lot, subject
matter of the lease, to third persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since plaintiff-appellant is no longer the owner of the property,
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> reiterated their prayer for the
denial of the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion for
reconsideration was denied by the lower court in its order of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="2"><span style="">2 </span><span style="">February 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> for lack of merit, hence this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following errors are assigned in

filed by plaintiff-appellant by giving weight to the assertion that the City
has no more interest to pursue this action for reformation because it has
already sold the property to third persons.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In our opinion, the appealed order was incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every party to a contract has a clear
interest that the instrument embodying its terms should conform to the actual
and true agreement had by and between the con­tracting parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, if by accident or <span style="">mistake, as </span>expressly
pleaded in the complaint, the document does not conform to or reflect the
actual agreement, either party can ask for the reformation of the instrument as
provided by Articles <span style="">1359, </span>et
seq. (Chapter 4, Title <span style="">2, Book </span>4) of the Civil Code of the Philippines, <span style="">to forestall </span>future
litigations on the true import of the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the Code Commission in its
Report, page 56,</p>

<blockquote>"The rationale of the doctrine is that it would be unjust and
inequitable to allow the enforcement of a written instrument <span style="">which </span>does not reflect or disclose the
real meeting <span style="">of </span>the minds of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rigor of the legalistic
rule that a written instrument should be the final or inflexible criterion and
measure of the rights and obligations of the contracting parties is thus
tempered, to forestall the effect of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct or
accident."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That the lessee's option to renew the contract for another term
of 10 years (which is alleged by appellant not to have been intended by the
parties) was not <span style="">yet exer</span>cisable when the suit for reformation was instituted by
the petitioner City (plaintiff below), because the original <span style="">and uncontested lease term of 10 years had
not yet expired, does not render the action premature, for precisely its
purpose was to have such option embodied in </span>the instrument declared
ineffective as one not agreed upon by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No cogent reason exists why the
plaintiff-appellant should wait for the lapse of the first ten years before
having the instrument reformed, when the <span style="">inconsis­</span>tency between it and the true agreement existed right
from the time the document was executed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contrary rule invoked by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and
sustained by the court below, tends to make the reformation more difficult, for
the evidence on the true intent of the parties may disappear before the first
ten years are over.</p>

<p class="BODY">That <span style="">plaintiff-appellant City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city> <span style="">disposed of </span>the land leased <u>after</u> the suit for reformation
had been filed does not <span style="">deprive </span>the City of personality <span style="">or real in</span>terest in the litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transferee of the property can not
maintain this action, for the plain reason that it was not a party to the
original agreement, and, therefore, <span style="">was
</span>not in a position to know what was the true contract agreed to by and
between the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, success or failure of
the <span style="">action for </span>reformation
necessarily reacts upon the extent of the City's obligations to its vendee, so
the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> interest still exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the trial court desired to find out the
transferee's stand on the issue, the logical action for it <span style="">to </span>take was to order the <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> or the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of the
purchaser, and thereby avoid future multiplicity <span style="">of actions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the City bound itself not <span style="">to <span style="">raise </span>the </span>question
of reformation until after the expiration of the first ten years of the lease,
as claimed by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> (defendants below), is a
matter of defense to be <span style="">raised in </span>the
answer, for that circumstance does not appear <span style="">on the </span>face of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is elementary that the <span style="">existence
</span>or non-existence of a cause of action must be determined on the face of
the complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the allegations <span style="">of which must </span>be deemed admitted for
the purposes of a motion to <span style="">dismiss </span>for
failure to state a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same rule applies to the <span class="GramE">court's</span> doubting the veracity
of the <span style="">alle</span>gations of the
complaint for the reason that the contract of lease appears on its face without
defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such doubt must be resolved only
after trial on the merits.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>
