				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a joint resolution of the above-entitled administrative
cases filed against City Judge Enrique B. Inting of Davao City.</p>

<p class="NUM">I - <u>ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER NO. 1810-CTJ</u></p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter complaint dated January 7, 1978 duly supported by
affidavits and other documents attached thereto, the complainant, Angelina S.
Salcedo, charged the respondent judge with violation of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practice Act (R.A. 3019) and Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, the charges are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that the res­pondent, from July 1, 1964 to June 30, 1965 and January
1, 1967 to September 30, 1974, had collected from the govern­ment overpayments
of his salary in the total amount of P38,100.00 to which he had no right, using
the said amount for his own personal benefit, to the prejudice of the Re­public
of the Philippines so that he is liable under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act and the Revised Penal <span style="">Code;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and (2) that in a series of applications for
leave of absence with pay (June 2-8, 1977; July 20-25, 1977; and August 8-12,
1977) filed with the Supreme Court, the respondent judge made it appear that he
had no pending administrative case, said representation being false be­cause as
of March 22, 1976, Administrative Matter No. 1229-CTJ was already filed against
him and that said ad­ministrative case had been already referred to the Execu­tive
Judge of the Court of First Instance of Davao for in­vestigation, report and
recommendation and the said inves­tigation, report and recommendation by the
Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of Davao City had not yet been
terminated.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The administrative
complaint was referred to City Judge Enrique B. Inting for comment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a second indorsement dated February 23, 1978, the respondent
judge alleged that the two (2) charges of over­payments of his salary and
falsification of his applications for leave of absences had been the subject of
criminal charges for estafa through falsification of public documents and for
corrupt practices under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act filed against
him before the City Fiscal of Davao by the complainant herein and his counsel
Atty. Samuel Occeña.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As comment to the
charges, the respondent submitted his counter-affidavits filed with the City
Fiscal's Office dated January 25, 1978, January 30, 1978 and February 1, 1978,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of Special
Counsel Rodrigo R. Duterte dated <span style="">February
14, </span>1978 duly approved by Acting City Fiscal Alfredo B. Santos on
February 23, 1978 dismissing the charges for insufficiency of evidence was
likewise submitted.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent also submitted as addendum to his comment the list
of overpaid City Judges furnished him by the Acting Officer-in-Charge of the
Fiscal Management &amp; Budget Office of <span style="">this
Court, (Exhibits "1" &amp; "1-A").</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In his supplemental comment, the respondent
bewailed the fact that he was singled out of the numerous judges who received
overpayments of their <span style="">salaries and </span>stated
that some City Judges like himself who <span style="">were
</span>recipient of the alleged overpayments were allowed to <span style="">retire </span>by just deducting the
overpayments received by them from the proceeds of their respective retirement
pay by this <span style="">Court.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the record of this case shows that the respondent
judge may not be held criminally or administrative­ly liable for the
overpayments of his salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
over­payments commenced and were made possible by the mistake of construction
accorded to statutes providing salary increases <span style="">of city judges </span><span style="">by Financial and Budget Officers of the Depart</span><span style="">ment of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened before the transfer of the
supervision of all courts to this Court by the new Consti­tution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge and the other city
judges who received overpayments had not in any manner intervened or
participated one way or the other in the issuance of their treasury
warrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the City
Fiscal of Davao absolving the respondent judge of any criminal liabi­lity in
receiving the overpayments in salary is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent can not be held liable in this
administrative case filed against him because the elements of malice, cor­rupt
or fraudulent acts were found to be lacking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere receipt and appropriation of the proceeds of the various
treasury warrants by the respondent payee herein, motivated by his honest and
firm belief that they were legally due him, does not prove the existence of <u>mala</u>
<u>fide</u> to subject him to administrative sanction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has repeated­ly ruled,
administrative proceedings are "in their nature highly penal in character
and are to be governed by the rules of law applicable to criminal cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charges must, there­fore, be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The second charge against the respondent judge of falsely stating
in his applications for leave with pay that he had no pending administrative
case when in fact Adminis­trative Matter No. 1229-CTJ was filed as early as
April 1976 with this Court, should likewise be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the three (3) applications for leave of
absence with pay<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
filed by respondent bear no such false statements made by respondent himself
that he has no pending administrative case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The statements "PENDING ADM. CASE, 'NONE' " stamped on the
face of the applications were made by employees of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge should not be made
liable for something he did not falsely state.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even granting that said leaves of absence were applied for by the
respondent judge with knowledge of his pending administrative case, his act is
sanctioned by this Court's Memorandum Circular dated November 29, 1977, which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Please <span style="">be </span>informed
that the long standing policy of not granting leaves with pay to officials and
employees with pending administrative cases against them has been changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henceforth, a mere pendency of an administrative
case against an official and employee shall not prejudice his right to vacation
leave with pay ‘in view of the presump­tion of innocence in favor of the
respondent'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall be entitled to a
vacation leave with pay unless otherwise ordered by the Court en banc or<span style=""> </span>the Division to which the case
pertains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Officials and employees are
hereby en­joined to favorably act on request for vacation leaves even if there
is a <span style="">pending administrative case filed
against him."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">II - <u>ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER NO. 1995-CTJ</u></p>

<p class="BODY">In a verified complaint dated August 8, 1978, Samuel C. Occeña, a
member of the Philippine Bar, charged the <span style="">res­</span>pondent judge, Enrique B. Inting, with serious misconduct and
conduct prejudicial to the judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant alleged that he is the counsel of Mrs. Angelina
S. Salcedo, Assistant Docket Clerk of the City Court of Davao, who is the
complainant against the respondent in Administrative Case No. 1229-CTJ for
oppres­sion, serious misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the judiciary, filed
on March 22, 1976, and in Administrative Case No. 1810-CTJ for gross dishonesty
filed on January 7, 1978; that the respondent judge has taken personal of­fense
at complainant's representation of Mrs. Angelina Salcedo; that the respondent
judge has commenced a cam­paign of vilification against the complainant; that
on or about March 30, 1978, the respondent judge made a state­ment to the
MINDANAO DAILY MIRROR, a daily newspaper wide­ly circulated in Davao City and
the rest of Mindanao, falsely alleging that the complainant, a "lawyer of
Salcedo <span style="">x </span>x x has been
maintaining a long feud against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said that Occeña has filed several cases of administra­tive, criminal and
contempt charges against him as city judge in order to harass him."; that
the false and dero­gatory statement was published in the March 31, 1970 issue
of the MINDANAO DAILY MIRROR; that on Sunday afternoon, August 6, 1978, a
CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY MEETING of the Davao City High School Parents-Teachers
Association, of which the complainant was president, was scheduled; that the
res­pondent, who had not been attending meetings of such association before,
attended this particular meeting; that the complainant was presiding over the
meeting attended by about five hundred (500) persons, more or less, in the
auditorium of the Davao City High School; that when Item V <span style="">of the <u>Order of Business</u> was reached,
the respondent judge, without being recognized by the Presiding Officer, went
up to the stage and against the will of the complainant, grabbed the microphone
that complainant was using and des­pite being ruled out of order, said
respondent judge dis­rupted the meeting by delivering a long speech; that there­after,
the respondent judge attempted to preside over the meeting and shouted over the
microphone for the holding of elections, which was not in the agenda; that the
said be­havior of the respondent judge scandalized many parents, who left the
auditorium in disgust; that because of the disorder caused by the respondent
judge, the Constituent Assembly which entailed considerable expenses on the
part of the Davao City High School Parents-Teachers Association could not be
held; that after the meeting was disrupted, the respondent judge continued
shouting unsavory remarks on the floor of the auditorium; that the incidents
complained of herein and in the complaints of Mrs. Salcedo are not the only
instances demonstrative of respondent's propensity for violence; and that in
Administrative Case No. 1229-CTJ, the Supreme Court was requested to take
judicial notice of the letter complaint of former Mayor of Davao City, Atty.
Rodolfo Sarenas, sent to the President of the Philippines and referred to this
Court, wherein former Mayor Sarenas charged that he was publicly manhandled by
the respondent judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment dated October 3, 1978,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the res­pondent judge alleged that the charge regarding the pub­lication in the
March 31, 1978 issue of the Mindanao Daily Mirror is a repetition of the Fourth
Petition for Indirect Contempt in Administrative Matter No. 1229-CTJ in which
Atty. Samuel C. Occeña is counsel for the complainant Angelina S. Salcedo; that
the charge was later repeated in the Sixth Supplemental Complaint and Petition
for In­direct Contempt also filed in Administrative Matter No. 1229-CTJ; that
the Fourth Petition for Indirect Contempt and the Sixth Supplemental Complaint
and Petition for In­direct Contempt have been submitted for resolution to the
Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of Davao City, who conducted the
hearing of Administrative Matter No. 1229-CTJ; that in the hearing of the
Fourth Petition for Indirect Contempt and Sixth Supplemental Complaint and
Petition for Indirect Contempt in Administrative Matter No. 1229-CTJ, the
complainant, through Atty. Samuel C. <span style="">Occeña,
presented evidence only consisting of the issue of the Mindanao Daily Mirror
dated March 31, 1978 as Ex­hibits "A" and "A-1" but said
exhibits were denied admis­sion by the Executive Judge in an order dated May
30, 1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge further averred that the alleged false and
derogatory statement in the Mindanao Daily Mirror issue of March 31, 1978 did
not come from him; and that he merely furnished the reporter of the Mindanao
Daily Mir­ror with copies of respondent's affidavit and the resolution of the
City Fiscal of Davao which supported respondent's charge of libel against Atty.
Samuel C. Occeña filed with the City Fiscal's Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the charge of having allegedly disrupted the meeting of the
Davao City High School Parents-Teachers Association on August 6, 1978, the
respondent judge said that he was merely exercising his right of free speech
and he did not disrupt the meeting; that in advocating the holding of an
election in the meeting of August 6, 1978, <span style="">the </span>respondent judge never made any unsavory remark against the
complainant; that he did not misbehave and that he never mentioned the name of
Atty. Occeña; that the respondent only delivered a short talk after he was
requested by Atty. Nidea who had the floor; that the <span style="">res­</span>pondent did not grab from the complainant the microphone <span style="">he was using because the respondent used the
microphone installed on the floor; and that if there was any dis­turbance or
disruption of the meeting, it was caused by Atty. Occeña himself when he ruled
out and silenced everybody who spoke against the business of discussing the
proposed Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To support his explanation, the respondent judge attached the
joint affidavit of Perla Palma Gil and Emilia S. Sitjar<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and the affidavit of Atty. Alfredo B. Nidea.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that the respondent judge has maliciously
issued any statement for publication to the Mindanao Daily Mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there any sufficient evidence to
show that the respondent had misbehaved or <span style="">acted in a manner unbecoming of a City Judge at the meet­ing of the
Davao City High School Parents-Teachers Asso­ciation on August 6, 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The version of the respondent judge is
supported by the joint affidavit of Perla Palma Gil and Emilia S. Sitjar and of
the affidavit of Alfredo B. Nidea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the acts of the respondent judge
complained of have no direct relation with his official duties as City
Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The misfeasance or mal­feasance
of a judge, to warrant disciplinary action must have direct relation to and be connected
with the per<span style="">formance of official duties
</span><span style="">amounting </span><span style="">either to maladministration or willful,
intentional neglect and failure to discharge the duties of said judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in Amosco vs. Magro,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x Misconduct in office has a
definite and well-understood legal meaning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By uniform legal defini­tion, it is a misconduct such as affects his
performance of his duties as an officer and not such only as affects his
character as a private individual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such cases, it has been said at all times, it is necessary to separate the
character of the man from the character of the offi<span style="">cer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * It is settled that
misconduct, misfeasance, or mal­feasance warranting removal from office of an
officer, must have direct relation to and be con­nected with the performance of
official duties amounting either to maladministration or willful, intentional
neglect and failure to discharge the duties of the office * * *. "</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the two (2) administrative complaints against
the respondent, Judge Enrique B. Inting, Admi­nistrative Matters Nos. 1810-CTJ
and 1995-CTJ, are here­by DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>
