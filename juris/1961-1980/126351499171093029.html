				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First In­stance of Manila in
Civil Case No. 51466 sentencing <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> Valenzuela
to pay the plaintiffs “the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,166.60</span> as actual
damages, plus P5,000.00 as moral damages and P1,000.00 <span style="">as </span>attorney’s fees and the costs of this suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of his failure to pay the said amounts
due to insolvency, the defendant Emilio <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> shall
pay the same".</p>

<p class="BODY">Briefly <span style="">stated, </span>the
facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the
morning on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1962</st1:date>,
the now deceased <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Correos</span>
alighted from a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> at Plaza Lawton,
Sta. Cruz, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All <span style="">of
a sudden, the passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven by appellant
Valenzuela and owned by Emilio <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, his
co-appellant, came from behind and bumped the rear part of the former, thus
pinning <span class="SpellE">Correos</span> between the two vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As</span> a result he sustained body injuries
which ultimately caused <span style="">his </span>death
on <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1962</st1:date>, after what
the lower court found to be "a prolonged and agonizing illness".</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, his widow and the children filed the corresponding
action for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants - now
appellants - filed their answer in due time, but failed to appear on the day
set for the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the
lower court allowed the plaintiffs to present their evidence before the Deputy
Clerk of Court appointed as Commissioner for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of such evidence the decision
appealed from was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­fore its
rendition, however, or more specifically on November 3, 1962, the defendants
filed a motion to set aside the order of October 22 of the same year
authorizing the presentation of plaintiffs' evidence before the Deputy Clerk of
Court, alleging as grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> that their
counsel "was suddenly <span class="SpellE">striken</span> ill" on the
day set for the trial, and that his clients did not appear at said hear­ing
upon his own advice because he did not expect the presentation of the evidence
for the plaintiffs to ter­minate at that hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion alleged further <span style="">that </span>the defendants had good, valid
and <span class="GramE">substantial</span> defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was not verified nor was it
accompanied with affidavits of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, it was denied by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An urgent motion for reconsideration filed by
the defendants on November 27 of the same year was likewise denied for lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal the appellants contend that the lower court
erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in allowing the presentation of
evidence for the plaintiffs before a Commissioner; in not finding that the
sickness of defendants counsel constituted excusable negligence, and finally, <span style="">in </span>not granting the motion for relief
from judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceedings before the Commissioner appointed by the lower
court for the presentation of plaintiffs' evidence are valid and in accordance
with current court practice followed in default and similar cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be observed in this connection that
the rule invoked <span style="">by a</span>ppellants
refer to contentious cases where both parties <span style="">are available for and ready to go to trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With regards to the
denial of appellants' motion for relief from judgment, the record clearly shows
that their and their counsel's inability or failure to appear on the day of the
trial was not excusable at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, their own motion for relief avers that appellants’ failure to
appear was due to the advice of their own attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, their aforesaid motion was filed
without any supporting affidavit of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have held consistently in this connection that it is not enough to
allege in a motion of that kind that the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> </span><span style="">has a </span><span style="">good and meritorious defense, because that </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a mere conclusion and an expression of his own opinion as to the merit
of his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rules require such
motion to be supported by affidavits not only proving the ground re­lied upon
but likewise the merits of <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> case, which means
that it is the latter's duty to submit to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">court for
consideration, in the form of depositions or sworn statements, his testimony
and that of h</span><span style="">is </span><span style="">wit­nesses, so that the court may be in a
position to decide whether the re-opening of the case would be for a useful
purpose or would be a mere empty and useless gesture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <span style="">the
decision appealed from being in accordance with law and the evidence, the same
is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With
costs.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
