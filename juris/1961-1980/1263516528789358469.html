				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This suit for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition, filed on April 3, 1964, with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, had its roots in a bitter, protracted struggle on
the part of petitioners Maria O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aclan</span> and Rodolfo S. <span class="SpellE">Aclan</span>, who sought to establish their alleged right to
co-ownership over a parcel of land held by the principal respondent, Roman O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, brother of the first-named petitioner and uncle
of the other two, whose mother was likewise a daughter of the late Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, from whom it would appear in the petition, the
property was inherited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first-named
respondent in this suit for <i style="">certiorari</i>
and prohibition is the judge of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> H. <span class="SpellE">Endaya</span>,
it being alleged in the petition that the decision rendered by him in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case dated November 2, 1963, wherein the
plaintiffs were respondents Roman O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> and
his wife, Trinidad Torres, ordering the defendant therein named to vacate the
property as well as the writ of execution thereafter issued, and much more so,
the order of demolition as a consequence thereof, dated March 18, 1964, could
be impugned on jurisdictional grounds, there being a grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of prohibition was
likewise sought to prevent the carrying out of the order of demolition based on
the same jurisdictional objection.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged in the petition that on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1963</st1:date>, respondents Roman O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> and Trinidad Torres, as plaintiffs, filed with
the Municipal Court presided over by respondent Judge, a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> seeking to eject the defendants named therein
from the disputed parcel of land.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, mention was made of a motion for leave
to intervene, dated October 1, 1963, filed by petitioners, respondent Judge
issuing on October 7, 1963, an order allowing them to file an answer in
intervention.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an answer was in fact filed on October
18, 1963, petitioners as defendants in intervention alleging that the property
described in the complaint was owned by them in common with plaintiff, now
respondent, Roman O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, they, having acquired
the same jointly by inheritance from the aforesaid Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,
it being contended further that the land being owned <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span>, respondent Roman O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
could not, against the will of the majority of the co-owners, eject the
defendants named therein from the said parcel of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prayer was, therefore, for the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, according to their petition,
respondent Judge, "with grave abuse of discretion, totally brushed aside
the aforeÂ­mentioned Answer in Intervention" and on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1963</st1:date>, rendered its decision ordering
each and everyone of the defendants named therein to vacate the premises.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came the pivotal allegation in the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition: "That when the herein petitioners
were informed of the rendition of said decision and the import thereof, the
period for appeal had already expired and the corresponding writ of execution
had already been issued; hence, no appeal was taken from the said
decision."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other allegations dealt with the motion for demolition having
been filed by respondent spouses, as plaintiffs, on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1963</st1:date>, the denial thereof by
respondent Judge on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1963</st1:date>,
in view of a complaint for partition by the same parties with petitioners, as
plaintiffs, filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a reiteration of such a move on the part of respondent spouses, as
plaintiffs, in the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case with a
second motion for demolition being filed on February 29, 1964, respondent judge
this time, according to the petition, "with grave abuse of
discretion" issuing on March 18, 1964, an order of demolition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of such order,
however, contained the following: "The Clerk of Court is instructed,
however, that it should not be delivered to the plaintiffs or their counsel
until said Clerk of Court shall have received indubitable proof that counsel
for the defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> has been given at
least forty-eight (48) hours notice of this Order; so that said counsel may
have a chance to secure whatever remedy he may deem wise to seek in Civil Case
No. 979 of Branch I of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the fact that petitioners, as
plaintiffs in the partition case, were able to obtain a writ of preliminary
injunction, and that the issuance of the order of demolition would, according
to them, render it nugatory, this petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition was filed as already noted, on <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 6, 1964, the Honorable Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>,
as Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
gave due course to the petition requiring respondents, including among whom was
the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, to file an answer
within ten days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An answer was filed by
respondents Roman O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> and Trinidad Torres
with an express admission of the material allegations to the petition, taking
exception, however, to the conclusion set forth in the petition as well as
matters not consistent with the affirmative defenses raised by them, namely,
lack of a cause of action, bar by a prior judgment, and <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of another action between the same parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prayer was for a dismissal of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, the answer was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="4">April
 11, 1964</st1:date>, there was likewise a motion for judgment on the
pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the order of April 28, 1964, subject of this appeal, by
the Honorable Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Relova</span> where reference was made
to the admission "that in Civil Case No. 1058, defendants Ting Sing, <span class="SpellE">Apion</span> and Chua Bun <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, as well
as herein petitioners Maria O. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, et al.,
were represented by only one counsel and upon receipt of the decision referred
to, they did not appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and instead filed
instant petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> with
preliminary injunction." On the above decisive fact, according to such
order, the only question was whether <i style="">certiorari</i>
with preliminary injunction or appeal is the proper remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the answer should be was set forth in
the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "As in the
above-cited case, petitioners, who are <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> in
said Civil Case No. 1058, should have appealed from the decision of respondent
judge because it was the proper and adequate remedy."</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, for lack of merit, the petition for preliminary
injunction was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1964</st1:date>, a notice of appeal to
this Court from the above order was filed by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal is without merit; the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1964</st1:date> is in accordance with
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing set forth in the petition, considering the facts as
admitted by both parties, would, in any wise, betray the presence of any
jurisdictional defect calling for correction through the writs of <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal would thus be the proper remedy, as
held in the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, petitioners were not unaware of the inherent weakness
of their petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and
prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, they sought to
impart a possible due process question when they alleged that they could not
have taken the proper step of appeal, as when they were informed of the
promulgation of the decision in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case,
"the period for appeal had already expired and the corresponding writ of
execution had already been issued; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That no semblance of plausibility could be imparted to such an
allegation of denial of due process, was made evident in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> portion of the order to the effect that
petitioners as well as the defendants in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case were represented by one counsel who evidently was furnished a copy of the
aforesaid decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no
denial that such in fact was the case, then the claim, that there was no notice
of such decision and that, therefore, petitioners could not be bound, was
without factual support, and hence, not persuasive at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assume however, that they were represented by a different counsel
and, therefore, they could not be held to have been served with a copy of such
a decision, they could not have lost the period to appeal as in so far as they
were concerned as defendants in intervention, the period did not start as to
them, until after the date of actual receipt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In either case, therefore, the due process allegation is clearly devoid
of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1964</st1:date>, is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioners.</p>
