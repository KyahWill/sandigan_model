				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><p> Victorias Milling Co., Inc., thru its Vice-president J. J. Osorio,
oh December 17, 1947, declared under oath for purposes of taxation that
the true value of some of its old and new machineries after deducting
50% for depreciation was P2,979,080.00, to which the provincial
assessor added P1,033,100.00 as value of other not declared properties,
thus raising the total assessment of the machineries in 1948 to
P4,012,180.00. On the basis of the aforesaid declaration, the
provincial assessor assessed a tax of P41,121.80, which the company
paid under protest in 1048. This assessment became final and
conclusive, as no appeal therefrom was taken by the company to the
Local Board of Tax Appeals, as provided by Section 17 of the Assessment
Law and by Section 1 of Commonwealth Act 530.</p>
<p> In 1949, the provincial assessor assessed the same machineries at
only P3,904,310.00 (arrived at by deducting from P4,012,180.00
approximately 3% as estimated annual depreciation due to ordinary wear
and tear) and the corresponding tax of P39,043.10 was paid under
protest in the same year. In 1950, together with other machineries, the
company was assessed at P4,101,490.00 and paid under protest the tax
thereon of P1,014.90; in 1951, the same machineries were assessed at
P4,060,000.60, in 1952 P3,273,930.00, and in 1953, P3,023,910.00, and
the company paid under protest the taxes of P40.600.60, P32,729,30, and
P30,239.10, in 1951, 1952 and 1953, respectively.</p>
<p> After more than five years since it paid under protest the taxes
mentioned in the preceding paragraphs and though the assessment made of
said taxes had long become final and conclusive for lack of appeal to
the then Board of Tax Appeals as abovementioned, the company filed on
April 24, 1953 a complaint before the Court of First Instance of Negros
Occidental against the collection officials of said province demanding
from them an additional 24% depreciation of its pre-war machineries
computed at the rate of 3 per cent a year for eight years retroactive
from 1940 to 1947, thereby claiming that it be entitled to a total of
74% depreciation of its machineries as of 1948 based on the so-called
"straight line method" of computing depreciation, and praying that the
1948 assessment be correspondingly reduced and the proportionate
partial refund of the tax be made based on the reduced assessment. The
company made a similar request with regard to the assessment made of
the machineries for the year 1949, 1950,1951,1952 and 1953 so that the
corresponding partial refunds may be made based on the reduced
assessments in line with the so-called "straight line method."</p>
<p> On May 11, 1953, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the court <em>a quo</em>
had no jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof, to which plaintiff
filed an opposition, and after plaintiff and defendants had filed their
reply and rejoinder, respectively, the court a. quo denied the motion
declaring itself with jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p> On June 23, 1953, the defendants filed an answer wherein as a special defense they reiterated their plea that the court <em>a quo</em> had no jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p> The parties submitted the case on a partial stipulation of facts,
since most of the allegations in the pleadings were not disputed, the
issues involved being purely of law, and on January 24, 1956, the court
<em>a quo</em> rendered decision sustaining <em>in toto </em>the issues
formulated by the plaintiff. In substance, the decision ordered the
defendants to employ the "straight line method" of depreciation in the
assessment of plaintiff company's machineries at the rate of 3% a year
for eight years retroactive to 1940 thru 1947, thus granting an
additional 24 % depreciation as of 1948, aside from the 50%
depreciation already deducted by the company for the same years, which
decision likewise ordered the defendants to refund to the plaintiff the
amount of P134,969.70 representing over-collections for six years from
1948 to 1953. </p>
<p> This decision became final and executory in view of the failure of
the provincial fiscal to file on time the brief for appellants
(Resolution of this Court of June 11, 1975 in G. R. No. L-11523). And
acknowledging his responsibility, the provincial fiscal now offers as
an excuse that his failure is due to the confusion that arose when all
the records of the case were forwarded to the Office of the Solicitor
General in connection with the appeal taken in Civil Case No. 2670.</p>
<p> Since the decision become final and executory as above-stated, on petition of the plaintiff company, the court <em>a quo</em>
issued on September 28,1957 an order directing the issuance of a writ
of execution, and, complying therewith, the clerk of court issued the
writ on October 3, 1957. But before said writ could be carried out, the
defendants interposed the present petition for certiorari wherein they
pray for the nullification of the decision and the order of execution
issued in the original case and for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction to prevent the execution from being carried out
pending the disposition of the instant special action. This Court
granted the writ upon the posting of a bond of P5,000.00.</p>
<p> It should be noted than on June 16, 1954, or eighteen (18) months
before the decision in the main case was rendered by the court <em>a quo</em>
Republic Act No. 1125 was enacted granting to the Court of Tax Appeals
exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal the decisions of
the Collector of Internal Revenue, Commissioner of Customs, and
Provincial or City Boards of Assessment Appeals in all cases involving
disputed assessments of internal revenue taxes, customs duties, and
real property taxes, and providing that all said cases that were then
pending determination in the courts of first instance shall be
certified and remanded by the respective clerk of court to the Court of
Tax Appeals for final disposition thereof. However, in spite of the
fact that when said Act was approved the present assessment case was
still pending decision by the Court of First Instance of Negros
Occidental, the latter court, in open disregard of the mandatory
provisions of said Act, decided the same on the merits, instead of
remanding it to the Court Tax Appeals. It is for this reason that the
validity of said decision is now impugned. It is on this ground that
petitioners have resisted the enforcement of the writ of execution
issued by the court <em>a quo</em>.</p>
<p>We declare that the provisions of Section 22 of said Act which
postulate that "All cases involving disputed assessment of Internal
Revenue taxes or customs duties pending determination before the Court
of First Instance shall be certified and remanded by the respective
clerk of Court to the Court of Tax Appeals for final disposition
thereof", are mandatory. Their open disregard by a court of first
instance renders its decision null and void.</p>
<p>It is true that said Section 22 seemingly limits its scope as
regards the cases to be remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals to those
involving assessment of internal revenue taxes and customs duties,
while the "present case admittedly refers to an assessment of land tax,
but this is of no moment for in interpreting the context of said
Section 22 we should not ignore Section 7 of the same Act which defines
the extent and scope of the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals.
Thus, in a recent case wherein a similar issue was raised, we laid down
the following ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is true that under section 22 of said Act the
only cases that are required to be certified and remanded to the Court
of Tax Appeals which upon its approval are pending determination before
a court of first instance are apparently confined to those involving
disputed assessment of internal revenue taxes or customs duties, and
the present case admittedly refers to an assessment of land tax, but it
does not mean that because of that apparent omission or oversight the
instant case should not be remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals, for an
interpreting the context of the section above adverted to we should not
ignore section 7 of the same Act which defines the extent and scope of
the jurisdiction of said court. As we have held in a recent case,
'section 22 of Republic Act No. 1125 should be interpreted in such a
manner as to make it harmonize with section 7 of the same Act and that
the primordial purpose behind the approval of said Act by Congress is
to give to the Court of Tax Appeals exclusive appellate jurisdiction
"over all tax, customs, and real estate assessment cases throughout of
the Philippines and to hear and decide them as soon as possible" '
(Ollada <em>vs.</em> The Court pt Tax Appeals, 99 Phil, 604; 52 Off.
Gaz., 4667). Considering this interpretation of the law, it logically
follows that the lower court did not act properly in denying) the
motion to remand the instant case to the Court of Tax; Appeals. (Bislig
Bay Lumber Company, Inc. <em>vs.</em> The Provincial Government of Surigao, 100 Phil, 303; 52 Off. Gaz., 7242.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Nor can it be contended that the instant case should, not be
remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals because it does not involve an
appeal from, the decision of a Board of Assessment Appeals upon the
theory that said court is merely given appellate jurisdiction to review
by appeal, while the present case is an original action instituted to
test the legality of an assessment on the strength of our ruling in the
case of Roxas <em>vs.</em> Rafferty, 27 Phil., 957, the reason
therefor being that the of repeated Section 22 refers to all cases
involving disputed assessment <em>without distinction</em>.</p>
<p>And with regard to the issue that certiorari does not lie when a
petitioner can avail of any other plain, speedy and other adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law, such as an appeal, which
petitioners have failed to avail of because of their failure to file
their brief within the reglementary period, suffice it to state that
the instant petition impugns not only the validity of the decision
rendered in Civil Case No. 2670, but also the order of execution issued
by respondent judge on September 8, 1957 which, it is claimed, was
issued with grave abuse of discretion, or in excess of the court's
jurisdiction on the matter. This claim certainly constitutes one
justification for the filing of the present petition.</p>
<p> It appearing that the decision rendered in Civil Case No. 2670 is
null and void for having been rendered in disregard of Section 22,
Republic Act 1125, it follows that the order of execution issued by
respondent judge on September 28,1957 Is likewise null and void. The
attempt, therefore, on the part of respondent officials to execute said
decision is unwarranted.</p>
<p> Wherefore, petition is granted. The decision of respondent judge
rendered on January 24, 1066, as well as his order issued on September
28, 1956, are hereby set aside. It is ordered that Civil Case No. 2670
be remanded to the Court of Tax Appeals for appropriate action. The
writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court is declared
permanent. No costs.</p>
<p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
