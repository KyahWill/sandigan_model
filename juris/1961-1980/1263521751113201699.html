election registrar of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1971</st1:date> the petitions for exclu­sion from the

filed motions to dismiss the cases on the ground that they were filed beyond
the deadline of September 9, 1971 fixed under section 137 of the Election Code
of 1971, which provides that such exclusion cases may not be filed within the
period of sixty days before a regular election.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court denied petitioner's dismissal motions for lack

petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

pre­mises pending the Court's resolution of the issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent election registrar maintains in his answer that the
exclusion cases were timely filed with respondent court by virtue of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolution No. RR-938 duly promulgated on September
3, 1971, extending, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, the period for
the filing of such exclusion cases up to October 14, 1971, inclusive, under the
authority of the transitory provisions of section 240 of the new Code, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the Election Code of 1971 fixes definite periods and
dates for certain pre-election acts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it would no longer reasonably be possible to observe
some of the periods and dates prescribed in said Code and as a matter of fact
some of these periods and dates have already elapsed, while other periods and

those who may desire to avail themselves thereof or without depriving voters of
their right of suffrage;</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court holds that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> validly extended the dead­line for the filing of
exclusion cases under the express authority thus granted it in section 240 of
the new Code:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 240.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Designation of certain
pre-election acts immediately after the approval of this Act.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If upon the approval of this Act, it should
no longer rea­sonably be possible to observe the periods and dates herein
prescribed for certain pre-election acts in the 1971 elections, the Commission
shall fix other periods <u>or order</u> that voters shall not be deprived of
their right of suffrage."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The legislative injunction in section 247 of the new Code that
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> "shall have such powers pertaining
to election matters, only as are expressly granted in this Code, existing laws
or jurispru­dence to the contrary notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing herein contained shall be construed
as a grant of implied powers," as invoked by petitioner, is not herein
applicable.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be recalled
that under the previous law, the dead­line for the filing of such exclusion
cases would have been later by fif­teen days and would have expired only on
September 24, 1971, since it provided for a longer period for the filing of
such cases excepting only <u>forty-five days</u> before a regular election,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
as against the earlier deadline of <u>September 9, 1971</u> under the new Code
proscribing the filing of exclusion cases within the period of <u>sixty days</u>
before a regu­lar election.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the previous law provided for the registra­tion of qualified voters on
any date but not later than sixty days before a regular election<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
it could readily be seen that the application of the new Election Code, as
sought by petitioner, would in effect practi­cally foreclose the right to file
exclusion cases:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- voters under the pre­vious
law had <u>up to</u> September 9, 1971 to register (60 days before the
election) yet no exclusion case could be filed against them, since under the
new Code, no such case may be filed <u>after</u> September 9, 1971 (no
exclusion case may be filed within 60 days before the election).</p>

<p class="BODY">Such extension to <u>October 14, 1971</u> of the deadline for
filing of exclusion cases was made doubly necessary since the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in Article I of its cited resolution of September
3, 1971 extended the period for registration of voters "before election
registrars - (to) every working day up <u>to September 10, 1971</u>," with
a view of giving the voters every opportunity to register and not be deprived
of their right of suffrage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With­out
such extension, the period to file exclusion proceedings would have expired on <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1971</st1:date>, even before the
expiration on <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1971</st1:date>
of the extended period for registration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, to avoid giving such unintended sanctuary to disqualified
and illegally registered voters, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> properly
exercised the authority granted under the transitory provision of section 240
of the new Code to extend the period for the filing of exclusion cases <u>up to
</u><st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="10"><u>October 14, 1971</u></st1:date>,
only for the 1971 elections.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The text and substance of
the transitory authority granted to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in
the cited section of the new Code do not warrant petitioner's restrictive view
that the purpose of the extension should be that "voters shall not be
deprived of their right of suffrage," whereas exclusion pro­ceedings
precisely seek to deprive certain registered voters of their right to vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, voters who have been registered in the permanent
list notwithstanding their being disqualified, or illegally registered, or
fictitious, - which is the burden of the petitions below - may not validly
claim to be deprived of their right of suffrage, if they are ordered exclu­ded
as the Election Code ordains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
again, as it was no longer rea­sonably possible to observe the deadline for
exclusion cases as prescribed in section 137 of the new Code since the
deadline, September 9, 1971, was close at hand when the new Code was approved,
the very condition therein laid down for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
exercise of the transitory authority to extend the deadline for the filing of
such exclusion cases was clearly satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already stated above, since the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
extended to <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1971</st1:date>
the period for registration of new voters, it necessarily had to ex­tend to a
reasonable period to <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1971</st1:date>
the period for filing peti­tions for the exclusion of disqualified or
fictitious voters who may have succeeded in being illegally registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it should not escape attention
that the questioned resolution likewise extends the same deadline for <u>inclusion</u>
proceedings which otherwise it would not have been reason­ably possible to
observe, because of the belated enactment and approval of the new Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is hereby dismissed and the
temporary restraining order of <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="10">October
 7, 1971</st1:date> is recalled and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of the shortness of the time left before the November 8, 1971
elections, this decision is declared immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and respondent court is directed to forthwith hear and re­solve the pending
exclusion cases before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">SO OR­DERED.</span></p>
