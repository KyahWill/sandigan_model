				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">We dismiss the petition at bar challenging petitioner's pre­ventive
suspension from office by the previous administration, by virtue of the issues
having become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Patricio G. <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, filed on
April 23, 1965, his petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus against res­pondent
public officials, questioning <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
the validity and legality of the letter of April 13, 1965 of respondent Ramon
A. Diaz, then Executive Secretary, transmitting the President's order
suspending petitioner from his office as Provincial Gover­nor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> and directing him
to turn over the office to respondent Belen F. Calderon, then Vice-Governor of
the prov­ince, as a result of administrative charges filed on March 19, 1964
against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asserting that
Article VII, Section 10(1) of the Philippine Constitution derogated the
President's author­ity to suspend and remove provincial officials under Section
2078 of the Revised Administrative Code and that <span class="SpellE">prescinding</span>
<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, the order suspending petitioner from
office was without factual basis and constituted a “purely arbitrary and highly
oppressive act,” petitioner further sought the issuance of a writ of prelimi­nary
injunction enjoining the enforcement of the suspension order as well as
enjoining Assistant Solicitor General Antonio A. Torres, who was designated
Special Investigator by the Office of the Pres­ident, from continuing his
investigation of the administrative charges against petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations of the petition were traversed in the
Solicitor-General's Answer filed on <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="4">April
 28, 1965</st1:date>, and hearing on the prayer for preliminary injunction was
held on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 14, 1965, petitioner filed an urgent
motion for resolution of his petition for preliminary injunction, and if such
resolution might still be delayed, prayed for the issuance of a restraining
order enjoining the respondent Assistant Solicitor General from continuing with
the investigation of petitioner, as newly scheduled by said respondent for May
17 to <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1965</st1:date>, until
the Court shall have resolved the petition for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1965</st1:date>, required the
Solicitor-General to comment on petitioner's urgent motion within ten days and
issued in the meanwhile the restraining order prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such comment was not filed by the Solicitor
General's Office, despite several extensions granted for the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the case on the merits set on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1965</st1:date>, the parties were
given a period of ten days within which to submit simultaneously their
respective memoranda in lieu of oral argument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last action that appears in the record is that both parties were
granted extensions up to September 28, 1965 within which to file their
respective memoranda, and that the period lapsed without such memoranda ever
having been filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious from the parties' loss of interest that the pre­sent
petition became moot with the change of administration by virtue of the
November, 1965 national elections and the expiration of the four-year term of
office of petitioner as Provincial Gover­nor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> on the last day of December, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court takes judicial notice of the fact
that petitioner was reelected for another four-year term to the office of
Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
in the local elections held in November, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue raised in the case as to the application of
Section 2078 of the Revised Administrative Code has likewise become academic
with the enactment on <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="9">September 12,
 1967</st1:date> of Republic Act 5185, known as the Decentralization Act of
1967.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby dismissed without
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
