				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 2, 1958, Efren A. Miranda, postmaster of the municipality of 
Cantillan, province of Surigao, was charged in the Court of First Instance of 
Surigao with the crime of malversation of public funds through falsification of 
public documents in that on five different occasions and dates, during the 
period from May 19, 1955 to February 29, 1956, the accused allegedly falsified 
and made alterations in his records of collections and payments and official 
cash books, to make it appear that more sums were paid out by him on telegraphic 
transfers and money orders to certain persons than those actually disbursed, and 
then misappropriated and converted the difference to his own use and benefit, to 
the damage and prejudice of the national government in the amount of P3,684.8l 
(Criminal Case No. 2379).
<p>On August 21, 1959, the accused moved to dismiss the case on the ground that 
within 24 hours after the discovery of the supposed malversations, he reimbursed 
or made good the missing amounts, thereby negativing criminal intent on his 
part, and furthermore, that whatever criminal liability he had incurred under 
the circumstances was extinguished by such reimbursements. The trial court 
sustained the motion and dismissed the case under the following order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>The accused is charged with malversation of public funds thru falsification 
of public documents. The attorney of the accused has filed a motion to dismiss 
on the ground that as the accused made good the amount supposed to have been 
lacking in his account even before the filing of the information, no crime was 
committed by the accused.</p>
<p>The Court was also informed that in a similar case, the accused was prevailed 
upon by the Auditor's Office to reimburse the amount found short in his account 
on the promise that he would not be prosecuted anymore. In this present case, 
the accused had also been promised by the Auditor's representative that if he 
made good the amount found short in his account, he would mot be prosecuted 
anymore. As it turned out, he has been prosecuted but the other fellow was note 
To say the least, this is unfair to the accused, as it shows favoritism for the 
other fellow and discrimination against this accused. This Court will not permit 
such actuation by any public official.</p>
<p>In the case of People <i>vs</i>. Tolentino, the Supreme Court has laid down 
the doctrine that the only difference between estafa and malversation is that in 
estafa, the object is private property whereas in malversation, it is public 
funds, In that case, the person who was accused returned to the respective 
owners the money that he had solicited before the information was filed. The 
Supreme Court held that there was no damages caused to the supposed offended 
parties because the corresponding amounts solicited were returned to them and 
the return of the money in that case was made during the investigation by the 
police agencies and before the information against the accused was filed by the 
Provincial Fiscal.</p>
<p>Wherefore, for the foregoing, the Court hereby orders the dismissal of this 
case with costs <i>de oficio</i>. The bail bond filed by the accused for his 
provisional liberty is hereby ordered cancelled."</p></blockquote>
<p>The assistant provincial fiscal moved to reconsider the above order of 
dismissal, arguing that granting that there was no malversation, there was still 
the charge of falsifications of public documents embodied in the same 
information wherein damage is not an essential element; but the lower court 
denied the motion to reconsider, hence this appeal by the government.</p>
<p>We agree with appellant that the information should not have been 
dismissed.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is too well-settled for any serious argument that 
whether in malversation of public funds or <i>estafa</i>, payment, 
indemnification, or reimbursement of, or compromise tis to, the amounts or funds 
malversed or misappropriated, after the commission of the crime, affects only 
the civil liability of the offender but does not extinguish his criminal 
liability or relieve him from the penalty prescribed by law for the offense 
committed, because both crimes are public offenses against the People that must 
be prosecuted and penalized by the Government on its own motion, though complete 
reparation should have been made of the damage suffered by the offended parties 
(U.S. <i>vs</i>. Mendezona, 2 Phil., 353; U.S. <i>vs</i>. Ongtengco, 4 Phil., 
144; U.S. <i>vs</i>. Rodriguez, 9 Phil., 153; People <i>vs</i>. Leachen, 56 
Phil., 737; Javier <i>vs</i>. People, 70 Phil., 550; Camus <i>vs</i>. C.A. and 
People, 92 Phil., 85; 48 Off. Gaz., No. 9, 3898; Bacsarpa, et al. <i>vs</i>. 
C.A., 99 Phil., 112; 53 Off. Gaz., [8] 3967; People <i>vs</i>. Gervacio, 102 
Phil., 687; 54 Off. Gaz., [9] 2898; People <i>vs</i>. Benitez, 108 Phil., 921). 
Assuming, therefore, that the accused Miranda had indeed fully reimbursed or 
returned the amounts he is supposed to have malversed, still his criminal 
liability is not extinguished thereby and he must still account and be 
prosecuted for any malversations he has committed.</p>
<p>Secondly, while Miranda alleged in his motion to quash that his having 
returned the amounts missing in his accounts before the filing of this case 
negatives criminal intent on his part, and that the falsifications and 
malversations charged against him are actually nothing more than honest mistakes 
or errors in the entries or computations made by him in his books and records, 
such facts constitute at most <i>a defense</i> against the charges against him 
which he must prove at the trial; but does not constitute any valid ground for 
the dismissal of this case at a stage when trial has not even begun and the 
prosecution has not yet started presenting its evidence.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the lower court appears to have relied on a case decided by the 
Court of Appeals and cited in the motion to quash of the accused Miranda (People 
<i>vs</i>. Gatmaitan, C.A.-G.R. No. 14127-R, September 26, 1957, although in the 
order, the trial court erroneously attributes the doctrine to our ruling in 
People <i>vs</i>. Tolentino, 69 Phil., 715) as authority for the proposition 
that the return to the offended party of the amounts misappropriated before the 
filing of an information against the offender exculpates the latter from all 
criminal liability. Apart from the fact that this Court can not be bound by any 
decision rendered by a court of lower category, especially if such decision 
conflicts with the established rule laid down by us in similar cases, we have 
read the decision cited in its entirety and have verified therefrom that the 
Court of Appeals acquitted the accused therein, not because he returned the 
money he was supposed to have misappropriated before criminal action was taken 
against him, but because that Court found, on the whole of the evidence, that 
there was absolutely no criminal intent on the part of the accused, shown, among 
other things, by his voluntary return to the complainants of their money even 
before he was formally charged with the crime of estafa.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the trial court, in dismissing this case upon the motion to quash 
of the accused Miranda, also seems to have been greatly influenced by the fact 
that in a similar case, another government employee who was supposed to have 
committed the same offense as herein charged was not prosecuted after he had 
returned the funds supposed to have been malversed by him, and the trial court 
considered it highly discriminatory and unjust that after the herein accused had 
made reimbursements of the amounts missing from his accounts because the same 
authorities had promised him that he would not be prosecuted any more if he made 
such reimbursements, the present case was still filed against him. Suffice it to 
say on this point that the neglect, laxity, or complacency of government 
officials in taking legal action against one erring employee does not justify 
the dismissal of any criminal action taken against another erring employee. If 
the court <i>a quo</i> had really wanted to equalize justice and avoid 
discrimination in the two cases, it should have ordered and directed the 
prosecution of the other government employee who is allegedly guilty of a 
similar offense, instead of dismissing the present case against the accused 
Efren A. Miranda.</p>
<p>Fifthly, as correctly pointed out by the assistant provincial fiscal in his 
motion for reconsideration of the order of dismissal, even assuming that the 
reimbursements made by the accused Miranda had extinguished any criminal 
liability he might have incurred for malversation, there is still the charge of 
falsification of public documents embodied in the same information. It is clear 
enough that even if Miranda is able to show that he committed no malversation, 
he may still be found guilty of the lesser crime of falsification of public 
documents, which is necessarily included in the complex crime of malversation 
through falsification of public documents charged in this case. This is another 
salient reason why the dismissal of the information against Miranda by the lower 
court before trial was improper and premature.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of dismissal appealed from is reversed and set aside, 
and the lover court is ordered to proceed with the trial of this case on the 
merits. Costs against the accused Efren A. Miranda.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., 
Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and 
<i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
