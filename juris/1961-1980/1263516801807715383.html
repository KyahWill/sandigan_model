				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Our decision of December 16, 1968, sustaining the action taken by
respondent Commissioner of Customs, the case reach­ing us in view of its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> by the Court of Tax Appeals, upholding the
validity of the seizure of the vessels and cargo in question, done outside our
territorial jurisdiction, a decision intended, according to our opinion, to
lend support to the govern­mental "policy relentlessly adhered to and
unhesitatingly pursued to minimize, if not to do away entirely, with the evil
and corruption that smuggling brings in its wake," is under fire from
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their printed motion for
reconsideration, dated <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="1">January 14,
 1969</st1:date>, substantially a rehash of the points previously raised by
them, there is an insistence on the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Customs
authorities justifying such seizure on the high seas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss, therefore, to give
further thought to such a jurisdictional issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to our decision of December 16, 1968, petitioners,
"owners of five sailing vessels and the cargo loaded therein declared
forfeited by respondent Commissioner of Customs for smuggling," raised the
principal question of "the validity of their interception and seizure by
customs officials on the high seas, the contention being raised that importation
had not yet begun and that the seizure was effected outside our territorial
waters." The answer to such a question depended on the finding of facts of
the Court of Tax Appeals, well nigh decisive in its effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For we are bound by what was found by the
Court of Tax Appeals, the case having reached us in a petition for the review
of its decision of November 19, 1964, the opinion being penned by the late
Associate Judge <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in our decision:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The facts according to the above opinion 'are not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.' Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'It appears that on September 10, 1950, at about noon time, a customs
patrol team on board Patrol Boat ST-23 intercepted the five (5) sailing vessels
in question on the high seas, between British North Borneo and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> while they were heading towards <span class="SpellE">Tawi-tawi</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
ordering the vessels to stop, the customs officers boarded and found on board,
181 cases of 'Herald' cigarettes, 9 cases of 'Camel' cigarettes, and some
pieces of rattan chairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sailing
vessels are all Philippine registry, owned and manned by Filipino residents of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, and of less than thirty (30) tons burden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sandakan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, British North <st1:place>Borneo</st1:place>,
but did not possess any permit from the Commissioner of Customs to engage in
the importation of merchandise into any port of the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> <span class="GramE">sea</span></st1:place>, as required
by Section 1363(a) of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their cargoes were not covered by the
required import license under Republic Act No. 426, otherwise known as the
Import Control Law.' "</p>

<p class="BODY">It should not escape notice that the jurisdictional question was
vigorously pressed before the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not deemed persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted in its opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"'We perfectly see the point of the
petitioners but considering the circumstances surrounding the apprehension of
the vessels in question, we believe that Section 1363(a) of the Revised
Administrative Code should be applied to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been established that the five vessels
came from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sandakan</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
British North <st1:place>Borneo</st1:place>, a foreign port, and when
intercepted, all of them were heading towards <span class="SpellE">Tawi-tawi</span>,
a domestic port within the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> <span class="GramE">sea</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Laden with foreign manufactured cigarettes, they did not possess the
import license required by Republic Act No. 426, nor did they carry a permit
from the Com­missioner of Customs to engage in importation into any port in the
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> <span class="GramE">sea</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their course announced loudly their intention
not merely to skirt along the territorial boundary of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
but to come within our limits and land somewhere in <span class="SpellE">Tawi-tawi</span>
towards which their prows were pointed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, they were about to cross our aquatic boundary but
for the inter­vention of a customs patrol which, from all appearances, was more
than eager to accomplish its mission.’”</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, our decision likewise quoted the vigorous
language employed by the late Judge <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> in
rejecting such a plea, one that must have been prompted by his sense of
realism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">'As </span>he so emphatically expressed it:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"'To entertain even for a moment the
thought that these vessels were probably not bound for a Philippine port would
be too much a concession even for a simpleton or a perennial optimist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite irrational for Filipino sailors
manning five Philippine vessels to sneak out of the<span style=""> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and go to British North <st1:place>Borneo</st1:place>, and <span class="GramE">come</span>
a long way back laden with highly taxable goods only to turn about upon
reaching the brink of our territorial waters and head for another foreign
port."</p>

<p class="BODY">We did point out that our decision affirming that of the Court of
Tax Appeals could be based correctly on such a finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other outcome could be expected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is rare, as was noted, for us to
substitute our own discretion for the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the situation before us was not
one of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the appreciation of the relevant facts and the appraisal
made cannot be impugned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, we
gave more than a passing consideration to the allegation of absence of
jurisdiction and upheld the action of the Commissioner of Customs as affirmed
by the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why we did
so was explained in our opinion thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is unquestioned that all vessels seized are of Philippine
registry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Revised Penal Code leaves
no doubt as to its applicability and enforceability not only within the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
its, interior waters and maritime zone, but also outside of its juris­diction
against those committing offense while on a Philippine ship * * *. The
principle of law that sustains the validity of such a provision equally
supplies a firm foundation for the seizure of the five sailing vessels found
thereafter to have violated the applicable provisions of the Revised
Administrative Code."</p>

<p class="BODY">There was an added reason for the conclusion reached by us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Moreover, it is a well-settled doctrine of Inter­national Law that
goes back to Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Church v. <span class="SpellE">Hubbart</span>,
an 1804 decision, that a state has the right to protect itself and its
revenues, a right not limited to its own territory but extending to the high
seas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Chief Justice
Marshall:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The authority of a nation
within its own territory is absolute and exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seizure of a vessel within the range of
its cannon by a foreign force is an invasion <span style="">of that territory, and is a hostile act which it is its duty to
repel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But its power to secure itself
from injury may certainly be exer­cised beyond the limits of its
territory.'"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, undeterred, would, <span class="GramE">invoking</span>
Section 1141 of the Revised Administrative Code, press anew the jurisdictional
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The seizure of the said vessels and
their cargoes, on the high seas, by the Collector, under whose direction it was
effected, constitutes a gross misuse of govern­ment powers, which is not only
not legally justified in our system of government, but in violation of our
laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even under the present stress
brought upon our government by the serious problem of smuggling said misuse of
government powers is condemned by the very system of our government."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1141 of the Revised Administrative Code insofar as
pertinent provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For the due
and effective exercise of the powers conferred by law in the Bureau of Customs,
and to the extent requisite <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, said Bureau
shall have the right of supervision and police authority over all seas 'within
the juris­diction of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and over
all coasts, ports, harbors, bays, rivers, and inland waters navigable from the
sea."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The present legal statutory pro­vision is found in the Tariff and Customs Code
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in almost identical language except for the explicit reference to jurisdiction
being exercised over airports.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above section, while apparently lending support to the
contention of petitioners in their motion for reconsider­ation, should not be
given a restrictive significance, especially one which would negate the power
exercised by the Commissioner of Customs in this case in view of the undeniable
fact of smuggling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, under the
circumstances disclosed, the government would be rendered powerless and its
effort to protect itself from the evils of smuggling nugatory, then a
competence, the existence of which as above pointed out in Church v. <span class="SpellE">Hubbart</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
is not subject to doubt in accordance with an accepted International Law
doctrine, would be taken away from it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We should be lo <span class="GramE">the to</span> arrive at such a result,
repugnant as it is, to the constitutional precept that among the basic
postulates of our policy is the adoption of "the generally accepted
principles of international law as part of the law of the nation."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There may be need of a more extensive citation from the opinion
of Justice Marshall in Church v. <span class="SpellE">Hubbart</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That the law of nations prohibits the exercise of any act of
authority over a vessel in the situation of the <st1:city><st1:place><u>Aurora</u></st1:place></st1:city>,
and that this seizure is, on that account, a mere marine trespass, not within
the exception, cannot be admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
reason from the extent of protection a nation will afford to foreigners to the
extent of the means it may use for its own security does not seem to be
perfectly correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is opposed by
principles which are univer­sally acknowledged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The authority of a nation within its own territory is absolute and
exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seizure of a vessel
within the range of its cannon by a foreign force is an invasion <span style="">of that territory, and is a hostile act which
it is its duty to repel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But its power
to secure itself from injury may certainly be exer­cised beyond the limits of
its territory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * These means do not
appear to be limited <span class="GramE">Within</span> any <span style="">certain </span>marked boundaries, which
remain the same at all times and in all situations." That Church v. <span class="SpellE">Hubbart</span> is a lading case <span style="">is </span>attested by its being cited almost textually in such leading
case books as Hudson,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Fenwick</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and Briggs.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is an equally valid ground for so construing the
Administrative Code provision in question as to justify the seizure herein
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it would necessarily follow
from the decisive facts as found by the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, as the language of the late
Judge <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> so emphatically stressed, that even for
"a simpleton or a perennial optimist" the thought that these vessels
"were probably not bound for a Philippine port," would be "quite
irrational" for Filipino sailors "manning five Philippine vessels
[would not] sneak out of the Philippines and go to British North Borneo, and
come a long way back laden with highly taxable goods only to turn about upon
reaching the brink of our territorial waters * * *." There is thus more
than ample justification for indulging in the legal fiction that the seizure
conducted under such peculiar circumstances could be considered as having taken
place within Philippine waters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
other view would render nugatory a conceded governmental power.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
in order to frustrate an attempt of the domiciliary administrator, the County
Trust Company of New York, from refusing to honor a valid order of a probate
court, we held that the shares of stocks in the possession of such domiciliary
administrator could be considered as lost contrary to the admitted fact so that
new shares of stocks of the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated,
Inc. could be issued in their place for delivery to the ancillary administrator
in the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we pointed out in
our opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It may be admitted of
course that such alleged loss as found by the lower court did not correspond
exactly with the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more
blunt, the quality of truth may be lacking in such a conclusion arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be remembered however, again to borrow
from Frankfurter, 'that fictions which the law may rely upon in the pursuit of
legitimate ends have played an important part in its development.' <span class="GramE">" Nor</span> did we stop there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Speaking of the common law in its
earlier period, <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> could state that fictions
'were devices to advance the ends of justice [even if] clumsy and at times
offensive.' Some of them persisted even to the present, that eminent jurist,
noting 'the quasi contract, the adopted child, the constructive trust, all of
flourishing vitality, to attest the empire of 'as if' today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise noted 'a class of fictions of
another order, the fiction which is a working tool of thought, but which at
times hides itself from view till reflection and analysis have brought it to
the light.'”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other point raised regarding the denial of due process was
already passed upon by us in our decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After quoting the applicable statutory prescriptions, we stated in our
opinion: "From the above recital of the legal provisions relied upon it
would appear most clearly that the due process question raised is
insubstantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the facts on
which the seizure was based were not unknown to petitioners-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On those facts the liability of the vessels
and merchandise under the above terms of the statute would appear to be
undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action taken then by the
Commissioner of Customs was in accordance <span style="">with
law." </span>There is nothing in the motion for reconsideration that
should call for a different conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our decision closed on this note: "It is thus most evident
that the Court of Tax Appeals <span class="GramE">had</span> not in any wise
refused to adhere faithfully to controlling legal principles when it sustained
the action taken by respondent Commissioner of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a reproach and a reflection on the
law if on the facts as they had been shown to <span style="">exist, </span>the seizure and forfeiture of the vessels and cargo in
question were to be characterized as outside the legal competence of our
government and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the constitutional rights
of petitioners-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately,
as had been made clear above, that would be an undeserved reflection and an
unwarranted reproach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vigor of the
war against smuggling must not be hampered by a misreading of international law
concepts and a misplaced reliance on a consti­tutional guaranty that has not in
any wise been infringed." We reiterate such a view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Authority, reason and policy are in unison in
support of the decision thus reached.</p>

In addition to Professor Gray, cited in connection with the above portion of
the opinion, reference may likewise be made to <span class="SpellE">Vaihinger</span>,
writing on juristic fictions. Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"The <span style="">basis </span>for this
method is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>since laws cannot
include within their formulae all particular instances, certain special
examples of an unusual nature are treated as if they belonged to them. Or else,
because of some practical interest, an individual instance is brought under a
general concept to which it does not really belong. Anyone conversant with the
method of jurisprudence will easily understand how important this artifice is
for legal practice. It is just as essential for law as for mathematics." <span class="GramE">(The Philosophy of; 'As 'If', 33 [1935]).</span> Also:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the <span class="SpellE"><u>fictio</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">juris</span></u></span><u><span style="">,</span></u><span style=""> </span>too, something that has not happened is regarded as having
happened, or <u>vice</u> <u>versa</u>, or an individual case is brought under
an analogous relationship violently in contradiction with reality. Roman law is
permeated throughout by such fictions, and in modern countries it is in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
espe­cially that juristic fictions have undergone additional development."
