				<H3>BENJAMIN MASANGCAY, PETITIONER, VS. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Benjamin Masangcay, with several others, was on October 14, 1957 charged 
before the Commission on Elections with contempt for having opened three boxes 
bearing serial numbers 1-8071, 1-8072 and 1-8073 containing official and sample 
ballots for the municipalities of the province of Aklan, in violation of the 
instructions of said Commission embodied in its resolution promulgated on 
September 2, 1957, and its unnumbered resolution dated March 5, 1957, inasmuch 
as he opened said boxes not in the presence of the division superintendent of 
schools of Aklan, the provincial auditor, and the authorized representatives of 
the Nacionalista Party, the Liberal Party and the Citizens' Party, as required 
in the aforesaid resolutions, which are punishable under Section 5 of the 
Revised Election Code and Rule 64 of the Rules of Court. Masangcay was then the 
provincial treasurer of Aklan designated by the Commission in its resolution in 
Case CE-No. 270, part II 2 (b) thereof, to take charge of the receipt and 
custody of the official ballots, election forms and supplies, as well as of 
their distribution, among the different municipalities of the province.<p></p>
<p>In compliance with the summons issued to Masangcay and his co-respondents to 
appear and show cause why they should not be punished for contempt on the basis 
of the aforementioned charge, they all appeared before the Commission on October 
21, 1957 and entered a plea of not guilty. Thereupon, evidence was presented by 
both the prosecution and the defense, and on December 16, 1957 the Commission 
rendered its decision finding Masangcay and his co-respondent Molo guilty as 
charged and sentencing each of them to suffer three months imprisonment and pay 
a fine of P500, with subsidiary imprisonment of two months in case of 
insolvency, to be served in the provincial jail of Aklan. The other respondents 
were exonerated for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Masangcay brought the present petition for review raising as main issue the 
constitutionality of Section 5 of the Revised Election Code which grants the 
Commission on Elections as well as its members the power to punish acts of 
contempt against said body under the same procedure and with the same penalties 
provided for in Rule 64 of the Rules of Court in that the portion of said 
section which grants to the Commission and members the power to punish for 
contempt is unconstitutional for it infringes the principle underlying the 
separation of powers that exists among the three departments of our 
constitutional form of government. In other words, it is contended that, even if 
petitioner can be held guilty of the act of contempt charged, the decision is 
null and void for lack of valid power on the part of the Commission to impose 
such disciplinary penalty under the principle of separation of powers.</p>
<p>There is merit in the contention that the Commission on Elections lacks power 
to impose the disciplinary penalty meted out to petitioner in the decision 
subject of review. We had occasion to stress in the case of Guevara vs. The 
Commission on Elections<span class="style1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that under the 
law and the constitution, the Commission on Elections has not only the duty to 
enforce and administer all laws relative to the conduct of elections, but also 
the power to try, hear and decide any controversy that may be submitted to it in 
connection with the elections. In this sense, we said, the Commission, although 
it cannot be classified as a court of justice within the meaning of the 
Constitution (Section 30, Article VIII), for it is merely an administrative 
body, may however exercise quasi-judicial functions insofar as controversies 
that by express provision of law come under its jurisdiction. The difficulty 
lies in drawing the demarcation line between the duty which inherently is 
administrative in character and a function which calls for the exercise of the 
quasijudicial function of the Commission. In the same case, we also expressed 
the view that when the Commission exercises a ministerial function it cannot 
exercise the power to punish for contempt because such power is inherently 
judicial in nature, as can be clearly gleaned from the following doctrine we 
laid down therein:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * In proceeding on this matter, it only discharged a ministerial duty; 
it did not exercise any judicial function. Such being the case, it could not 
exercise the power to punish for contempt as postulated in the law, for such 
power is inherently judicial in nature. As this Court has aptly said: 'The power 
to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts; its existence is essential to 
the preservation of order in judicial proceedings, and to the enforcement of 
judgments, orders and mandates of courts, and, consequently, in the 
administration of justice' (Slade Perkins vs. Director of Prisons, 58 Phil., 
271; U.S. vs. Loo Hoe, 36 Phil, 867; In Re Sotto, 46 Off. Gaz., 2570; In Re 
Kelly, 35 Phil., 944). The exercise of this power has always been regarded as a 
necessary incident and attribute of courts (Slade Perkins vs. Director of 
Prisons, <i>Ibid</i>.). Its exercise by administrative bodies has been 
invariably limited to making effective the power to elicit testimony (People vs. 
Swena, 296 P., 271). And the exercise of that power by an administrative body in 
furtherance of its administrative function has been held invalid (Langenberg vs. 
Lecker, 31 N.E., 190; In Re Sims, 37 P., 135; Roberts vs. Hacney, 58 S.W., 
810)."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the instant case, the resolutions which the Commission tried to enforce 
and for whose violation the charge for contempt was filed against petitioner 
Masangcay merely call for the exercise of an administrative or ministerial 
function for they merely concern the procedure to be followed in the 
distribution of ballots and other election paraphernalia among the different 
municipalities. In fact, Masangcay, who as provincial treasurer of Aklan was the 
one designated to take charge of the receipt, custody and distribution of 
election supplies in that province, was charged with having opened three boxes 
containing official ballots for distribution among several municipalities in 
violation of the instructions of the Commission which enjoin that the same 
cannot be opened except in the presence of the division superintendent of 
schools, the provincial auditor, and the authorized representatives of the 
Nacionalista Party, the Liberal Party, and the Citizens' Party, for he ordered 
their opening and distribution not in accordance with the manner and procedure 
laid down in said resolutions. And because of such violation he was dealt as for 
contempt of the Commission and was sentenced accordingly. In this sense, the 
Commission has exceeded its jurisdiction in punishing him for contempt, and so 
its decision is null and void.</p>
<p>Having reached the foregoing conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to pass on 
the question of constitutionality raised by petitioner with regard to the 
portion of Section 5 of the Revised Election Code which confers upon the 
Commission on Elections the power to punish for contempt for acts provided for 
in Rule 64 of our Rules of Court.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from insofar as petitioner Benjamin 
Masangcay is concerned, as well as the resolution denying petitioner's motion 
for reconsideration, insofar as it concerns him, are hereby reversed, without 
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
