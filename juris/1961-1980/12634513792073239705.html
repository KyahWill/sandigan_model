<span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Matas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape</span> were charged with murder
for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>,
committed, according to the indictment, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about December 13, 1957, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
Philip­pines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the above-mentioned
accused, conspiring together and helping one another, with treachery and
evident premeditation, armed with rifles and sharp cutting instruments and with
intent to kill, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and criminally attack, assault and shoot one <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Doneza</span> with the <span style="">said
</span>firearms thereby inflicting upon him a gunshot wound which caused his
death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The commission of the foregoing offense was attended by the
aggravating circumstances of (1) superior strength, (2) use of firearms, <span style="">(3) </span>promise of a reward and <span style="">(4) </span>nighttime, the accused having
purposely sought it to facilitate <span style="">its </span>commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the lower court found all the accused, except <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>, who was
acquitted, and <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umpok</span>,
who is at large, guilty of murder qualified by trea­chery, and there being no
modifying circumstances present, sentenced them to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to indemnify jointly and severally the
heirs of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>,
in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>, and to pay the costs
proportionately.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment, appeal was taken by the defendants to the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, because the
penalty imposed by the trial court is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
the case was elevated to this Court for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case involves a lessee of public forest land and a group of
squatters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence for the prosecution
disclosed that <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> Ramos is the lessee of 960
hectares of public forest land in the <span class="SpellE"><u>sitio</u></span> of
<span class="SpellE">Daeg</span>, barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>

<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, he converted the leased land
into a ranch on which he constructed two ranch houses for his cowhands, one on
the lower part of the ranch, called Ranch House No. 1, and the other on the
upper part thereof, known as Ranch House No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the latter lived Jose <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>, Julian <span class="SpellE">Daroy</span>, and the
deceased, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>,
all cowhands of Ramos.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> in
the evening of <st1:date year="1957" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1957</st1:date>,
while the occupants of Ranch House No. 2 were asleep, there came a succession
of shots from the eastern side of the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Awakened, the cowhands took cover and flat on the floor, not budging
from their prone positions until early in the morning when they found one of
their companions, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>,
wounded near the left ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that same
morning of <st1:date year="1957" day="14" month="12"><span style="">December 14, </span>1957</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>
was brought to a certain Dr. <span class="SpellE">Villamin</span> for treatment
and thence to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Caños</span> in <span class="SpellE">Digos</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, due to the gravity of the wound, he
was finally taken to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Brokenshire</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he died on <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1957</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the municipal police of <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>
and the 72nd PC Company stationed in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
were informed of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately,
they proceeded to the ranch of Ramos to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found Ranch House No. 2 riddled with bullets,
and empty rifle shells scattered 30 to 50 meters away from the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the farm of the appellant Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>, a poncho raincoat containing assorted
paraphernalia, including live ammunition and two <st1:city><st1:place>Enfield</st1:place></st1:city>
rifles, was discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the house of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape</span> was found another
rifle.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Tuvilla</span> of the 72nd PC Company
conducted an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
exception of those of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape</span>,
the appellants' declarations were reduced to writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their writ­ten statements, they admitted
participation in the attack on Ranch House No. 2 on the night of <st1:date year="1957" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These statements were subsequently signed and
acknowledged by the appellants before Special Counsel <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
M. Barnes of the of<span style="">fice of the
Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this appeal, the
appellants make the following assignments of error:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1. The lower court erred in assuming jurisdiction to try the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. The lower court erred in not giving weight to the medical
certificates issued to the defendants-appellants, marked as exhibits 14, 14-A,
14-B, 14-C, 14-D, 15-A, 15-B and 15-C.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. The lower court erred <span style="">in
failing</span> <span style="">to </span>recognize the
fact that there was no motive on the part of the defendants-appellants to kill
or hurt the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. The lower court erred in finding that the alleged
extra-judicial confessions made by the defendants-appellants, separately marked
as exhibits 'E’, ‘F', ‘G', 'H', and 'I' were not obtained through violence,
maltreatment and intimidation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5. The lower court erred in giving much weight to the alleged
extra-judicial confessions executed by defendants-appellants, since the
prosecution failed to corroborate the same with evidence of corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the first issue, the
appellants maintain that the crime was not committed </span>in <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Daeg</span></span><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, as urged by the prosecution, but in <span class="SpellE">Dapok</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, by reason of
which the case should have been tried in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find </span>no <span style="">merit </span>in <span style="">this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pasture Land
Lease Agreement No. 173 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. V-1), issued in the
name of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> Ramos, shows that the 960 hectares of
public forest land leas­ed to him are located in the <span class="SpellE"><u>sitio</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Daeg</span>, barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>, </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bansalan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
sketch of the land attached to said Agreements (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
V) <span class="GramE">clearly</span> indicates that Ranch House No. 2 is within
the area leased to Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following
section 38, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, these official entries in the
records of the Bureau of Forestry are considered <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence of the facts therein stated, that is, that the land on which Ranch
House No. 2 stands is within the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">province</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
overcome this presumption, the evidence must be clear and convincing (</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Que</span> Ping, 40
Phil. 17, 19), and in the absence of other competent evidence to overthrow the
same, the entries must be taken and accepted as conclusive (Intestate Estate of
<span class="SpellE">Tenorio</span>, 40 O.G. 1253, 1257; <span class="SpellE">Gaas</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>, </span><span style="">54 </span><span style="">Phil. 196, 203).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants' evidence failed in this
regard and, consequently, the trial court <span class="GramE">be</span> held to
have had jurisdiction to try this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The other assigned errors
being interrelated, we shall consider them together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case for the
prosecution is anchored mainly on the extra-judicial confessions made by the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the exception of <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> who did not
make any confes­sion, <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umpok</span>
who was not apprehended and is still at large, and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lape</span> whose verbal confession wad not reduced to
writing, the appellants signed written statements relating to great detail
their participation in the attack on Ranch House No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These statements disclose that at about four
o'clock in the afternoon of December 13, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> went to the house of Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Laya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tacul</span> <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> to persuade the latter and the other appellants
who were then staying with him (i.e., <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Genovevo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Matas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gilvero</span>) to attack Ranch House No. 2 that evening; that the
appellants acceded to the proposal, although they initially objected, after
having been promised land of their own should they be successful in their
mission; that after supper that evening, the aforementioned appellants left the
house of <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> to carry out their criminal plan;
that Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saverio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> were armed with long-barreled guns while the
rest carried bolos; that they dropped by the house of <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> to inform him that they were already </span>on
<span style="">their way; that they met <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umpok</span> in the house of <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> armed with a carbine furnished by the latter;
that, thereafter they picked up Martin <span class="SpellE">Cabardo</span>,
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cabardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape</span> who were to guide them to the ranch house and to their
places of deployment; that upon arrival </span>in the <span style="">vicinity of Ranch House No. 2, the defendants deployed themselves, and
Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umpok</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape</span> started firing at it; that the whole epi­sode took
place between eleven o'clock and twelve midnight with the gunfire lasting for
about thirty minutes; that, after the shooting, they dispersed, the group of
Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> stopping by <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa's</span>
place once more to inform the latter of the outcome of their mission; that <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umpok</span> returned the
carbine of <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> while Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>
hid his gun and that of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>
upon arrival at the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While admitting the
authenticity of their signatures on the extra-judicial </span>confessions, <span style="">the appellants deny their <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
and veracity, alleging that they were procured through force, violence, duress
and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically</span>, t<span style="">hey testified that the PC soldiers under
Capt. <span class="SpellE">Bucoy</span> of the 72nd PC Company maltreated them,
inflicting bruises injuries contusions and wounds, on their bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As proof of the injuries they sustained, they
presented medical certificates made out by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
S. Santos and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> F. Mendoza of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span><span style=""> General</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
pretense of the appellants does not deserve belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for the medical certificates issued to
<span class="SpellE">Genovevo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gilvero</span> which attest to </span><span style="">the presence of unhealed wounds on their
bodies, the rest merely reveal </span>findings <span style="">of scars, abrasions, discolorations and complaints of pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants claim that this was because
the medical examination was conducted only on </span><st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="1"><span style="">January </span>6,
 1958</st1:date>, <span style="">or eighteen days
after their confinement in the PC barracks at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Davao</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> where the alleged maltreatment took
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note <span class="GramE">must,</span>
however, be taken of the fact that the counsel for the accused </span>in <span style="">the lower court had been these wounds as
early as </span><st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="12"><span style="">December </span><span style="">23, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Nevertheless,
they were not brought to the immediate attention of a physician for proper
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the lower court observed
in its decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"If the accused were still suffering from injuries and the
injuries were visible on their bo­dies on <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1957</st1:date>, when their lawyer, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Buagas</span>, saw them at the Provincial Warden's Office, there
was no sufficient reason why Atty. <span class="SpellE">Buagas</span>, did not at
once or the next day took (sic) them to the hospital for medical
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The excuse that there was
lack of guards at the Provincial Jail is not convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that there was lack of guards and no definite time could be ascertained as to
when a guard could be available Atty. <span class="SpellE">Buagas</span> would
have taken a doctor to the Provincial Jail to examine physically the accused
before the injuries healed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Buagas</span> would not wait until <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="1">January 6, <span style="">1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>considering that the accused told
him that they were forced to make confessions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the accused were finally exam­ined on <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="1">January <span style="">6, </span>1958</st1:date>,
they were able to show only healed wounds, scratches or mere complaints of pain
which a doctor can not verify."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As for the wound of <span class="SpellE">Genovevo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barro</span>, described in his
medical certificate as "contusion, <span class="SpellE">xyphoid</span>
process", the exam</span>ining <span style="">physician
testified on cross-examination by the fiscal that it was apparently inflicted
only three days before his physical </span><span style="">examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>A <span style="">similar disclosure was made </span>with
respect to the unhealed wound of <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gilvero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
wound, described as "partially healed multiple posterior elbow joint,
right", must have been caused five or six days only prior to the doctor's
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further testimony by the
examining physicians brought out the fact that the appellants' scars and wounds
are of a superficial nature and could have been self-inflicted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant's claim
that they were coerced, intimidated and brow-beaten into </span>affixing <span style="">their <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span>
and sig</span>natures on their extra-judicial confessions before Special
Counsel <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> M. Barnes of the Provincial <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office <span style="">is
belied by the evidence on record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Fiscal Barnes testified that after the PC soldiers brought the
accused to his office, they left the room at his request, leaving him alone
with the accused; that Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Adao</span>, a clerk of his
office, translated the contents of the affidavits into <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>,
which is understood by all the accused; that the latter affirmed the truth of
their declarations; that he asked the accused if <span class="GramE">they</span>
had anything more to add to their written statements and they answered in the
negative; that they voluntarily affixed their signatures and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> to their respective affidavits after which he received
their oaths; and that he did not see or notice any injuries or signs of
maltreatment on the bodies of the accused when they were brought to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Adao</span> corroborated
the foregoing testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared
that a PC soldier brought the accused to the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office sometime in December, 1957; that he translated the contents of the
affidavits into the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect; that the
affiants voluntarily signed their respective written declarations in his
presence; and that he did not see or notice any injuries on the bodies of the
accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constabulary officers and soldiers were no less ca­tegorical
in their denial of the appellants' claim of maltreatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. Antonio A. <span class="SpellE">Bucoy</span>,
head of the squad that was sent to investigate the shooting in <span class="SpellE">Daeg</span>, testified on rebuttal that he did not order the
accused exposed to the sun or in any way maltreated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Tuvilla</span>,
PC investigator, testified that he did not lay hands on the appellants and
neither did he threaten to ill-treat them if they did not sign their respective
affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other PC soldiers, namely, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordinario</span>, <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Layaguin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Espantaleon</span> and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Buit</span>, corroborated the testimony of Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Tuvilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the testimony of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Ozam</span>, a guard at the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Provincial Jail, militates against the appellants'
allegation of having been subjected to third-degree methods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He related that he saw the appellants when
they were admitted to the provincial jail on December 23, <span style="">1957 </span>but he did not see any injuries
on their faces and bodies after they removed their clothes for inspection.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants assail the veracity of the extra-judicial
confessions by putting up the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence for Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crispulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gilvero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Genovevo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> tended to
establish their presence in <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> on the night of December 13, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Matas</span> on the other hand, was allegedly in the house of a
certain <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span> Diana, a school teacher residing at <span class="SpellE">Padada</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
on that fateful night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar defense
was raised by Alfredo and Martin <span class="SpellE">Cabardo</span>, who tried
to show they were in their house in Upper <span class="SpellE">Patolangon</span>,
a part of <span class="SpellE">M'lang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape</span>, who
asserted that he was in his farm at <span class="SpellE">Dapok</span>, <span class="SpellE">M'lang</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cotabato</span></span>
when the incident at the Ramos ranch happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination and dispassionate evaluation of the
evidence on hand, we find that the appellants’ defense of alibi lacks that
plausibility sufficient to convince us of their <span style="">innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in mind the </span>oft-repeated
ruling of this Court that alibi is a weak defense for it is <span style="">easy to </span><span style="">ma­</span><span style="">nufacture </span>(People

considering, too, the existence of the extra-judicial <span class="GramE">confessions</span>,
which on their faces and as corroborated by other evidence, bespeak the true
sequence of events, we find the appellants' evidence proffered </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">shore up their defense of </span><span style="">ali­</span><span style="">bi not </span><span style="">convincing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">alibi </span>of Mauro
<span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and his aforementioned compa­nions finds
apparent support in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dandan</span>, <span style="">a </span>preacher
of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines who testified that Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and his friends dropped at his house at <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Kanapulo</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on December <span style="">7,
</span>1957 on their way to <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, and again on December <span style="">14, </span>1957 on their way home from <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As proof thereof, he presented a notebook (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. <span class="GramE">BB) which contains a list of the
persons who ate in his house on various occasions.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A close and careful <span style="">examination </span>of the notebook and its <span style="">contents, </span>however, fails to <span style="">give </span>credence to his testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span>an old
composition notebook with frayed edges, the first eight pages of <span style="">which contain </span>references to <span style="">biblical </span>passages and what <span class="GramE">appears to be notes</span> on proposed sermons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The so-called list <span style="">of visitors </span>who ate in his house starts on the bottom <span style="">third </span>of the eighth page with the
entry of August 2 to 5, 1956 and ends on the last line of the next page with
the <span style="">entry </span>of December <span style="">5, </span>1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for the last two pages, the <span style="">rest </span>of the notebook is blank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and
his friends <span style="">are </span>listed down as
visitors on December <span style="">7 </span>and <span style="">14, 1957 while </span>the former alone is
listed down on December 16 and 18, 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">The notebook acquires significance because of the fact <span style="">that </span>its existence was brought out
only on cross-examination <span style="">by </span>the
fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was produced in evidence only
after <span class="SpellE">Dandan</span> was <span style="">asked to bring it to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the entries therein were accepted as true then <span class="SpellE">Bacang's</span>
alibi assumes an aura of credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, this Court cannot rely on this piece of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the entries were written in pencil and
supposedly at various dates, yet there appears no variation in the strokes <span class="GramE">nor</span> in the shading of the pencil lines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further</span>more, while the list of
visitors is written in pencil, the rest of the notations and entries in the
notebook are in ink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
circumstance under which this notebook was produced is a bit puzzling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that <span class="SpellE">Dandan</span>
is a princ<span style="">ipal </span>witness for the
defense and that all along he had been possession of this important piece of
evidence, isn't it strange that he should make known its existence only after
the prosecution began asking him why he could remember his dates so well?
Wouldn't it be more logical to expect the defense to present this evidence on
direct examination, considering that <span class="SpellE">Dandan</span> is their
witness? We have examined the record on this point and our doubts have not been
erased by the witness' answers to the probing questions of the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, we find ourselves
with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in disbelieving <span class="SpellE">Dandan's</span>
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither can we accord
credit to the testimony of the other witnesses for Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>,
who was contacted allegedly by <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> in <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span> and </span>who <span style="">testi­fied
that the latter was with him </span>on <span style="">the
night of December 13, 1957 at Ely's Cafe, is the son of <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>, one of the accused, and the counsel for
the squatters on the ranch of Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Elena <span class="SpellE">Fontilla</span>, the owner of Ely's Cafe in <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, remembers too much for a woman who keeps </span>a
refreshment parlor frequented by numerous persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She re­members the dates of events long past
and of no moment at all when they happened----feats of memory equally displayed
by the other witnesses for <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and his
companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coin­cidence, too, seems to
play an important role in the defense of <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Odon Romero's testimony that Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and his friends were with him at Ely's Cafe on the
night of De­cember 13, 1957, celebrating the death anniversary of his <span class="GramE">father,</span> does not deserve serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the lo­wer court observed:</p>

<blockquote>"It was a strange coincidence that Odon Romero happened to be
in the house of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> when Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and his companions went there and that Odon Romero
celebrated the death anniversary of his father on December 13, 1957 at Ely's
Cafe and Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> and his inseparable companions
looked for Vicente <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>, found him at Ely's
Cafe, and were invited by Odon Romero to join in the celebra­tion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As for the alibi of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Matas</span>, we find that it is
supported only by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span> Diana, who
is his brother-in-law, and by <span class="SpellE">Rosaleo</span> <span class="SpellE">Nadela</span>, who admitted that he was reminded </span>only <span style="">by Diana of the date when he met <span class="SpellE">Matas</span>, i.e., December 13, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape’s</span> alibi was not corro­borated by any witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is true with the alibi of Martin <span class="SpellE">Cabardo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cabardo</span>, only the testimony of his father,
Julio <span class="SpellE">Cabardo</span>, corroborates his alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These testimonies are inadequate to support
the de­fense of </span>alibi which <span style="">must
be proved by "positive, clear and satisfactory evidence" (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Olais</span>, </span>36 <span style="">Phil.
828, 829)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense attempts to
dilute the strength of the pro­secution's case by picturing it as one huge
conspiracy among the Constabulary soldiers, the Provincial <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> Ramos against the eleven
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strands in this supposed
web, of intrigue and machinations are formed by evidence for the defense that the
wound sustained by <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Do­neza</span>
was caused not by </span>a <span style="">bullet but
by a protruding nail which pierced <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span> near the
left ear </span>as <span style="">he sought cover
during the shooting; by assertions that <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span> died
of respiratory complications and not </span>as a <span style="">result of a gunshot wound; by the testimony of hardly credible
witnesses identifying the rifles marked as Exhibits C, D and J as belonging not
to the accused but to the cowboys of Ramos; by the insinuation of <span class="SpellE">Crispiniano</span> <span class="SpellE">Jorgio</span>, one of the
defense witnesses that those who fired at Ranch House No. 2 were <span class="SpellE">Ilocanos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Moros</span>, based on his
having allegedly heard and seen several persons pass near his house after the
shooting speaking in <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> and wearing hats and
turbans; and by the attempt to establish as a fact that Ramos bribed the PC to
implicate the accused in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately for the appellants, the web they constructed cannot bear
the weight of the prosecution's evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Paraan</span>, who performed the
autopsy on the body of <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span> twenty-four hours after
his death, testified that she found an external wound below the left ear lobe,
"possibly an entrance wound of a gunshot".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet (which was never found on autopsy)
traveled six inches into the neck, fracturing the cervical vertebrae and
resulting in the severance of the spinal cord which was the immediate cause of
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants' <span style="">contention </span>that <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>
died because of respiratory complications is hardly supported by the evidence
on hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, their assertion that there is no evi­dence of
<u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> is not borne out by the
foregoing statement of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Paraan</span> and by the
testimonies of Jose <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span> and Ju­lian <span class="SpellE">Daroy</span>, who were sleeping beside the deceased on the night
of December 13, 1957, that <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span> sustained the wound
which caused his death during the shooting incident at Ranch House No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It hardly needs reiteration that in murder,
the fact of death is the <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>
(People vs. Garcia, et al., 99 Phil., 381; <span style="">54 ff. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 336, </span><span class="GramE">338</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule stated in section <span style="">3, </span>Rule 133 of the Rules of Court
simply means that there must be some proof, aside from an extra-judicial
confession, to show that the crime has been committed (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mamaril</span>, et al., <span style="">45
<span class="GramE">O<span style="">ff</span></span></span><span style="">. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 3431, <span style="">3434).</span></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While the prosecution may
have relied on the extra-judicial confessions of the appellants as their
primary weapon to secure conviction, yet they have not been lacking in other
evidence to corroborate the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside
from the evidence that the victim died of a gunshot wound, a witness for the
prosecution placed three of the accused within the immediate vicinity of the
scene of the crime just a few hours before the incident in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felix <span class="SpellE">Tolin</span>, a
laborer of <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>,
identified Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Umpok</span> and <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> as among those who came to the house of <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> on the night of </span><st1:date year="1957" day="13" month="12"><span style="">December 13, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other four who remained in the dark were not identified by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further testified that he saw the three
carrying rifles and that </span><span style="">after </span><span style="">about ten minutes they all left, heading for
the east side of Ranch House No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although he saw them talking with <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>,
he did not hear their conversation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is noteworthy that the number of persons who visited <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>
that evening corresponds with the number given in the extra-judicial
confessions of the appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There appears no reason to doubt or disbelieve the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Tolin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellants themselves admit that there is no ill-feeling between them and Felix
<span class="SpellE">Tolin</span> and that the latter did not have any reason to
testify falsely against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar
admission was made by the appellants with respect to the other witnesses for
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While most of the
witnesses for the defense are either close relatives or associates of the accused,
those for the prosecution are mostly disinterested persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">One other corroborative fact refers to the rifles used in the
shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The extra-judicial confessions
of the appellants are definite about the number of guns used in the attack on
Ranch House No. 2 and their respective owners or keepers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Lape</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umpok</span> each had a
rifle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That of <span class="SpellE">Lape</span>
was later taken from him by the Constabulary soldiers under Capt. <span class="SpellE">Bucoy</span> while the two rifles hidden by <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span>
were found by the PC in his farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
they denied ownership of the rifles during the trial, their denials are not
supported by any other evidence and are, in fact, contradicted by their <span class="GramE">own</span> admissions to the PC soldiers assigned to look <span style="">for </span>the guns.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the appellants
assail the alleged failure of the lower court to recognize the fact that there
was no motive on their part to kill <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doneza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
assertion is patently without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellants' very own statements before Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Tuvilla</span>
reveal that they agreed to attack Ranch House No. 2 on the promise of <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> that they will
</span><span style="">by </span><span style="">given land </span>of <span style="">their own should they be successful in attacking the ranch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire incident was prompted by the land
conflict between <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>, the alleged leader of the
squatters, and Ramos, the owner of the ranch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">As Mauro <span class="SpellE">Bacang</span> stated in
his extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.</span> I), <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span> ordered the
shooting of Ranch House No. 2:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Because of the land conflict between Dr. Ramos, and by reason
of which, he wanted the cowboys of Dr. Ramos killed so that Dr. Ramos will give
up ranching and he (<span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanosa</span>)
will occupy and cultivate the area of the ranch with his men.”</blockquote>
