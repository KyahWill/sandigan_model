				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a review <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span>
of the death penalty imposed in a murder case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="GramE">an amended</span> information filed on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1970</st1:date> with the Circuit
Criminal Court at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, a special counsel charged
Jose <span class="SpellE">Duaban</span>, 20, with murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged therein that on October 15, 1969 <span class="SpellE">Duaban</span> treacherously stabbed <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
Castillo, while the latter was asleep in his residence, inflicting upon him a
wound which <span style="">caused his death, and with
the aggravating circumstance of dwelling "and the special aggravating
circumstance of commission of a felony during the service of sentence (Art. <span class="GramE">160,</span> Revised Penal Code)".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment, <span class="SpellE">Duaban</span> was assisted
by counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pleaded guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution was not required to present
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of that plea of guilty, the trial court convicted <span class="SpellE">Duaban</span> of murder, sentenced him to death and required him
to pay an indemnity of twelve thousand pesos to the heirs of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court in its two-page decision
noted that the accused "freely and spontaneously" pleaded
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It observed that "the
accused is an escapee after having been sentenced" by it "on <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1969</st1:date> for the crime of
homicide" and that he had chosen "to become notorious and
incorrigible".</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the meager data in the record as to the prior sentence
imposed on the accused, this Court, upon motion of the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, former Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Barot</span>, and with the conformity of the Solicitor
General, required the Director of Prisons to state the criminal case which
caused his detention at the time he escaped from confinement on October 6,
1969, the offense of which he was convicted, the court that sentenced him and
whether he was serving a sentence which was already <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
or was merely a detention prisoner awaiting the disposition of his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">An administrative officer of the Bureau of Prisons informed this
Court that <span class="SpellE">Duaban</span> was serving the final judgment in
Criminal Case No. CCC-XIV-84 of the Circuit Criminal Court at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for homicide when he escaped from the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prison on <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1969</st1:date>
and <span style="">that he was recommitted to the
national penitentiary on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="5"><span style="">May 18, 1970</span></st1:date><span style=""> or after he was convicted in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> in
his brief dated <st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1970</st1:date>
candidly stated that the death sentence was properly imposed because the
accused was a quasi-recidivist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did
not discuss whether the trial court followed the procedure laid down by this
Court in cases where a plea of guilty is entered in capital offenses and
whether the trial court should have required the fiscal to present evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Solicitor General (now Justice) Felix Q. Antonio submitted a
manifestation stating that, since in the brief filed by the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> no assignment of error was made and, instead,
said counsel urged the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the death
penalty, he found it unnecessary to file an <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief and he concurred in the prayer in the brief for the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the death penalty was properly imposed considering
that the accused is a quasi-recidivist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under article 160 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty (<u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> maximum to death) for the murder committed by him should be
imposed in its maximum period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
correctly noted by the trial court, his plea of guilty was offset by the
aggravating circumstance of dwelling.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused exhibited a high degree of perversity, dangerousness
and criminality when he escaped from his confinement in the national
penitentiary at <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
proceeded to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and there killed the sleeping
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that when he pleaded guilty to the murder charge he
had already acquired some experience in the criminal proceeding for homicide,
it is reasonable to assume that he understood fully the nature and gravity of
the second offense which he had perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That could be the reason <span style="">why the
trial court (the same court that convicted him of homicide), in exercising its
sound discretion, did not find it necessary to require the prosecution to
present evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The situation in this case is similar to that found in People vs.
<span class="SpellE">Yamson</span> and Romero, 109 Phil. 793.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, <span class="SpellE">Eutiquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yamson</span> and Primo Romero, while serving prison sentences
<span style="">in </span>the
New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison, killed their fellow prisoner, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Reyes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Charged with murder, <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span> and Romero,
with the assistance of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
pleaded guilty at their arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution was not required to present evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court sentenced them to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was automatically elevated to this
Court for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
in his brief discussed the alleged improvidence of the plea of guilty and made
veiled insinuations that they were not fully informed of the consequences of
their plea.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving that issue, this Court held that the trial judge
must have been fully satisfied that the accused entered the plea of guilty with
full knowledge of the meaning and consequences of their plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the death penalty was affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Same holding in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Perete</span>, 111 Phil. 943 and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span>,
111 Phil. 406.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">What has been said above should not in anyway weaken the long
settled rule that "the proper and prudent course to follow where the
accused enters a plea of 'guilty' to capital offenses specially where <span style="">he is </span>an ignorant person with little
or no education,<span style=""> is to take testimony
not only to satisfy the trial judge himself but to aid the Supreme Court in
determining whether the accused really and truly understood and comprehended
the meaning, full significance and consequenc</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">s of his plea"
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bulalake</span>, 106 Phil. 767, 770.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See </span><span style="">People vs. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Baluyot</span></span><span style="">,
L-32752-3, </span><st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="1"><span style="">January 31, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, 75 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 148).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, it is <u>de</u> <u><span style="">rigueur</span></u> for the trial court to receive evidence whenever a
plea of guilty is entered in a capital case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">"Judges are duty-bound to be extra solicitous in
seeing to it that when an accused pleads guilty he understands fully the
meaning of his plea and the import of an inevitable conviction" (People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Abduhan</span>, Jr., L-19491, August 30, 1968, 24 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 798, 817).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">So, in a capital case, whenever the accused is to be arraigned,
the notice to the prosecution and the accused should be a notice of <u><span style="">arraignment and trial</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
clerk of court should issue subpoenas for the appearance of the prosecution
witnesses at the arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the
accused plead guilty and the imposable penalty <span class="GramE">be</span>
death, the trial court may then and there ask the prosecutor to present his
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused may present
evidence to prove miti­gating circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in simple and uncomplicated cases like the instant case,
it lies within the sound discretion of the trial court to dispense with the
taking of evidence if it is satisfied that the accused entered the plea of
guilty with full knowledge of the meaning and consequences thereof (U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Jamad</span>, 37 Phil. 305, 318).</p>

<p class="BODY">The primary rule is found in section 5, Rule 118 (formerly Rule
114) of the Rules of Court which provides that "where the defendant pleads
guilty to a complaint or information, if the court accepts the plea and has
discretion as to the punishment for the offense, it may hear witnesses to determine
what punishment shall be imposed".</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 was taken from section 229 of the proposed Criminal
Procedure of the American Law Institute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Ame­rican jurisprudence the rule is that "a plea of guilty must
be freely and understandingly made by one competent to know the consequences
thereof" and that "the court should or must satisfy itself as to the
voluntary character of a plea of guilty, especially <span style="">where the accused is not represented by counsel, and is young and
inexperienced" (22 C. J. S. 1176 and 1181).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The essence of a plea of guilty is that the accused admits his
guilt freely, voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences and
meaning of his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accused does
not clearly and fully understand the nature of the offense charged, if he is
not advised as to the meaning and effect of the technical language so often
used in complaints and <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in qualifying the
acts constituting the offense, or if he does not clearly understand the
consequences resulting from his admission of having committed the crime
described <span style="">in the precise technical
manner and form in which it is charged, his plea of guilty should not be
accepted, and, if accepted, it should not be held sufficient to sustain a
conviction (U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Jamad</span>, 37 Phil. 305, 313-314).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Carson states the rationale of the
rule in this manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Our experience has taught us that it not infrequently happens
that, upon arraignment, accused persons plead 'guilty' to the commission of the
gravest offenses, qualified by marked aggravating circumstances, when in truth
and in fact they intend merely to admit that they committed the act or acts
charged in the complaint, and have no thought of admitting the technical
charges of aggravating circumstances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It not infrequently happens that after a formal plea of
'guilty' it develops under the probe of the trial judge, or in the course of
the statement of the accused made at the time of the entry of his plea, or upon
the witness stand, that the accused, while admitting the commission of the acts
charged in the information, believes or pretends to believe that these acts
were committed under such circumstances as to exempt him in whole or in part
from criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Clearly, a formal plea of guilty entered under such circumstances
is not sufficient to sustain a conviction of the aggravated crime charged in
the information" (</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">U.
  S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"> vs. <span class="SpellE">Jamad</span>, 37 Phil. 305, 314).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The matter of what the trial court should do in case a plea of guilty
is entered in a capital case has been discussed in several cases beginning with
U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span>, 6 Phil. 541 decided in 1906.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case laid down the doctrine that “the
Courts of First Instance may sentence defendants in criminal cases who <span style="">plead guilty to the offense charged </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">complaint, </span><u><span style="">without
the necessity of taking testimony</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">However, in all cases, and especially in cases where the punishment to
be inflicted is severe, the court should be sure that the defendant fully
understands the nature of the charges preferred against him and the character
of the punishment to be imposed before sentencing him."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was further held in the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Talbanos</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>case that "while there is no law
requiring it, yet in every case under the plea of guilty where the penalty may
be death it is <u><span style="">advisable for the
court to call witnesses for the purpose of establishing the guilt and the
decree of culpability of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, however, </span>must be left </u><u><span style="">to the discretion of the trial </span>court</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be underscored that, as first formulated in the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Talbanos</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>case, the doctrine is ambivalent and
dualistic in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
is directed in case a plea of guilty is made in a capital case to call
witnesses so that it can be ascertained that the plea has not been improvidently
entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But at the same time it is
implied that the calling of prosecution witnesses may be dispensed with if the
trial court in the exercise of its sound discretion finds that it is not
necessary to examine the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is articulated in that cautious and guarded manner in
order to forestall a miscarriage of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An accused person should be sentenced to death only on the most
indubitable proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An accused who pleads
guilty in a capital case and who should be sentenced to death for having
admitted the aggravating circumstances alleged in the information may in
reality deserve a lesser penalty because of the presence of mitigating
circumstances not alleged in the information or he may <span style="">be </span>guilty not of a capital offense but of a lesser offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">That may be established by requiring the prosecution witnesses to
testify or by giving the accused an opportunity to present evidence after
hearing the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the arraignment, <span style="">he</span><span style=""> m</span>ay not be willing
to testify and to present <span style="">evidence but
after hearing the version of the prosecution, he may change his mind and decide
to present evidence which may throw light on the nature of the offense or
mitigate the penalty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"While it is true that a judgment convicting and sentencing
a defendant may lawfully be pronounced upon a solemn plea of 'guilty' in open
court and on arraignment, entered by the accused with full knowledge of the
meaning and effect of his plea, nevertheless, where the complaint charges <span style="">a </span>capital offense, the possibility of
misunderstanding or mistake in so grave a matter, justifies and in most
instances requires the taking of such available evidence in support of the
allegations of the information as the trial judge may deem necessary to remove
all reasonable possibility that the accused might have entered his plea of
'guilty' improvidently, or without <span style="">a </span>clear
and precise understanding of its meaning and effect" (U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>, 31 Phil. 91, 93-94).</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1917, or eleven years after the announcement of the doctrine
of the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Talbanos</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>case, this Court, at the specific
request of the Attorney-General, clarified and strengthened that doctrine in U.
S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Jamad</span>, 37 Phil. 305, 317-318 by enunciating
the following guidelines as to what the trial judge should do in case a plea of
guilty is made in a capital case:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essence of the plea of guilty in a
criminal trial is that the accused, on arraignment, admits his guilt freely,
voluntarily, and with full knowledge of the consequences and meaning of his
act, and with a clear understanding of the precise nature of the crime or
crimes charged in the complaint or information.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a plea of guilty, when formally entered
on arraignment, is sufficient to sustain a conviction of any offense charged in
the information, even a capital offense, without the introduction of further
evidence, the defendant having himself supplied the necessary proof.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the law in this
jurisdiction which forbids the introduction of evidence as to the guilt of the
accused, and the circumstances attendant upon the commission of the crime,
after the entry of a plea of 'guilty'.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having in mind the danger of the entry of
improvident pleas of 'guilty' in criminal cases, the prudent and advisable course,
especially in cases wherein grave crimes are charged, is to take additional
evidence as to the guilt of the accused and the circumstances attendant upon
the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The better practice would indicate that, when
practicable, such additional evidence should be sufficient to sustain a
judgment of conviction independently of the plea of guilty, or at least to
leave no room for reasonable doubt in the mind of either the trial or the
appellate court as to the possibility of a misunderstanding on the part of the
accused as to the precise nature of the charges to which he pleaded guilty.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">"(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding what has been said, it lies in<span style=""> </span><u>the sound judicial discretion of
the trial judge</u> whether he will take evidence or not in any case wherein he
is satisfied that a plea of 'guilty' has been entered by the accused, with full
knowledge of the meaning and consequences of his act.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;"><span class="GramE">"
(</span>7)<span style=""> </span>But in the event that no
evidence is taken, this court, if called upon to review the proceedings had in
the court below, may reverse and send back for a new trial, if, on the whole
record, a reasonable doubt arises as to whether the accused did in fact enter
the plea of 'guilty' with full knowledge of the meaning and consequences of the
act."</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that the said guidelines still retain the
dichotomous character of the original doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The guidelines require the trial court to receive evidence and to make
sure that the accused understands his plea of guilty but at the same time they
recognize and preserve the discretion of the trial court to convict the accused
merely on his plea of guilty if the court is convinced that the taking of
evidence is not necessary and that the accused understands the allegations of
the indictment and the consequences of his plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The guidelines so circumspectly formulated in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Jamad</u></span> case have been applied in subsequent
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was held that in view of
the danger of improvident pleas of guilty the proper course in capital cases is
to take evidence <span style="">as to the guilt of the
accused and the circumstances attending </span><span style="">the commission of the crime which evidence is sufficient to sustain a
conviction independently of the plea of guilty or, at least, to leave no doubt
that the accused understood the precise nature of the charge (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sabilul</span>, 93 Phil. 567).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. Del Rosario, L-33270, <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1975</st1:date>, 68 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 242,
250-2, more explicit directives were issued to trial courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was stated in that case that at the
arraignment the counsel of the accused should be accorded the fullest
opportunity to examine the record and to acquire all relevant information
regarding the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be given
ample time to know the facts from the accused himself so that he may properly,
intelligently and effectively <span class="GramE">represent</span> the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was stressed in the <u>Del Rosario</u> case that the degree of
the culpability of the accused should be established by means of the
presentation of evidence and that all the proceedings during the arraignment
and trial should be completely recorded.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it was held that a plea of guilty is
sufficient to sustain a conviction for a capital offense, without the
introduction of further evidence, if the trial court is satisfied that the plea
was entered with full knowledge of its meaning and consequences (People vs.
Acosta, 98 Phil. 642; People vs. Santos and Vicente, 105 Phil. 40; People vs.
Salazar, 105 Phil. 1058; People vs. Ala, 109 Phil. 390).</p>

<p class="BODY">Where the accused, assisted by counsel, pleaded guilty to an
information for robbery in an uninhabited building and it appears that he was
fully cognizant of the case because the information was read to him twice and
he was aware that his co­defendants had previously pleaded guilty and were duly
sentenced on the basis of their pleas, it was not necessary to take additional
evidence before rendering judgment against the said accused (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Triompo</span>, 100 Phil. 83).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a dictum that it is not the trial court's duty to <span class="GramE">apprise</span> the accused in a capital case as to the penalty that
would be imposed upon him in case he pleaded guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its duty is limited to informing the accused
of the nature and cause of the accusation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The counsel for the accused should inform him of the nature and gravity
of the charge so that the accused might fully realize the consequences of his
plea of guilty (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ama</span>, 111 Phil. 882).</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">resumé</span>, we hold that the instant
capital case, where the trial court did not require the prosecution to present
evidence after the accused pleaded guilty, is covered by the ruling that "<span class="SpellE">cuando</span> un <span class="SpellE">acusado</span> <span class="SpellE">admite</span> <span class="SpellE">libre</span> y <span class="SpellE">voluntariamente</span> <span class="SpellE">su</span> <span class="SpellE">delito</span> con <span class="SpellE">pleno</span> <span class="SpellE">conocimiento</span> de la <span class="SpellE">índole</span> exacta

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span class="SpellE">BARREDO</span>,<i> J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the conviction of appellant but I would like to
express my views regarding the issue of whether or not presentation of evidence
is necessary after an accused enters a plea of guilty to a capital offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is time that the Court clarified just how much
discretion a trial judge can exercise in dispensing with the presentation of
evidence in capital offenses where the accused pleads guilty at the
arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Going over Our decisions in
cases involving such situations, particularly those of more recent vintage,
like <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>, cited in the main opinion, one is
liable to get the impression that the rule is that it is the inescapable duty
of the trial judge to actually receive evidence of how the offense has been
committed before sentencing the accused, even in those cases wherein the judge
is convinced that the accused has fully understood the meaning of his plea
including the inevitable consequences thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, more often than not, trial judges have <span class="GramE">opted</span>
to order presentation of evidence, hardly minding if the plea of guilty of the
accused, entered with the assistance of counsel, was made providently or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> points out with
formidable authority that the correct procedure is that, as a general rule, the
court should receive evidence "not only to satisfy (the judge) but to aid
the Supreme Court in determining whether the accused really and truly
understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and consequences of
his plea", (citing <span class="SpellE">Bulalake</span>, <span style="">106 Phil. 767) </span>but this does not mean
that "the Courts of First Instance may (not) sentence defendants in
criminal cases who plead guilty to the offense charged in the complaint without
the necessity of taking testimony" when the "court (is) sure that the
defendant fully understands the nature of the charges preferred against him and
the character of the punishment to be imposed before sentencing him." (<span class="GramE">citing</span> <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span>, 6 Phil. 541.) In
other words, even when the offense charged is a capital one, the trial court
need not receive evidence as long as the judge is amply satisfied that the
accused has fully understood that the plea means that he admits that he has in
fact committed the offense charged precisely in the manner alleged in the information
or complaint and that he is ready and willing to accept the prescribed penalty <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, knowing what said penalty is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in the latter case, for the purposes
of the automatic appeal to the Supreme Court, the record must clearly show the
steps and measures taken by the judge to ascertain that fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">To my mind, it <span style="">is in </span>this
last aspect of the procedure where the real problem lies in actual
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not unusual that the
Court or, at least, a number of justices without whom conviction cannot be had
(the required number for the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of a judgment
imposing the death penalty being ten and in other cases eight) disagrees with
the trial judge as to the adequacy of the inquiry made by the latter in
ascertaining the real understanding of the accused of his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and again We have had to return the case
to the trial court, even when the record showed that the judge had made
inquiries in a manner satisfactory to him, so much so that perhaps, the accused
himself knew that he was fully aware of the meaning and consequences of his
plea, as in fact he did reiterate the same later, thereby delaying the
imposition of the penalty sometimes for years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, imposing a death penalty is such a matter of grave
responsibility that every possibility of error must be eliminated before it is
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But truth to tell, in instances
where I felt We were being over prudent, I could not help making the remark
that perhaps the Court might be making it more difficult to convict an accused
who pleads guilty than one who does not, which to me sounds absurd.</p>

<p class="BODY">As I see it, in the last analysis, under the procedure explained
in the main opinion, the trial judge does not only have to satisfy himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The steps taken by him must more importantly
satisfy at least ten members of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And my more than ten years of experience as a member of this Court
teaches me that it is rather difficult to achieve that criterion, considering
how some of us can be inclined to be very strict in imposing the death penalty
and would try to avoid it whenever there is any discernible excuse not to do
it.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing considerations, I believe that to
avoid recurrence of instances wherein We had to return cases to the trial
courts on the ground of improvidence of the plea of guilty entered by the
accused, the Court should make it a definite rule to require, in spite of the
plea of guilty of the accused, the presentation of evidence, including the
testimony of the accused, albeit as to the latter, it is not really to
constitute evidence against him but only to enable the court to be as certain
as it is humanly possible to do so that he really is as guilty as he admits to
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I imagine that unless very carefully
assisted by competent counsel, the feeling of remorse that seizes a person
accused of a capital offense can prevent him from realizing that he is
admitting and confessing to something more than he had actually committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, there are aggravating
circumstances defined by the Revised Penal Code the full import of which may
not be clear, even with the assistance of a lawyer, to a man of ordinary
intelligence or common understanding, and much less, of course, to one who is
illiterate or mentally retarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, there are times when the accused make confessions under a
misconception of the extent of their own guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, I recall a case wherein the accused, a black
American charged with having robbed and killed his "common-law"
mother-in-law who was over eighty years old and blind, continuously and
repeatedly addressed personally the court - repudiating the appearance of
counsel <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u> and refusing any such
assistance in the process - and insisted that he knew he was guilty and was
willing to be punished accordingly, to the extent that the judge had to
literally compel him to take the witness stand, after just the same receiving
all the evidence of the prosecution cared to present, only to contend in the
course of his testimony given upon questioning of the court that he did not intend
to commit such a grave a wrong as killing the old woman because all that he did
was to push her when she tried to resist, but when she fell her body hit a
trunk with hard edges, by reason of which she suffered hemorrhage and died.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the rule I am proposing could be time-consuming,
but it is to me quite plain that more time could be consumed by returning the
case to the trial court for another proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In any event, considering the value of human life, no effort on the part
of the state is too much to make in trying to avoid error in taking it away as
a legal sanction for an offense against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">I might add before closing that I am not taking the above
position because I do not trust or have confidence that our trial judges can
exercise sound and proper discretion in the situations contemplated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, my apprehension is that because some
members of the Court quite often disagree, rightly or wrongly, with the extent
of the inquiry made by the trial judge, the final disposition of cases where
the accused pleads guilty and is thereby entitled to an earlier termination of
his ordeal may be unnecessarily delayed.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="">DIS</span>SENTING
OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <span class="SpellE"><i>C.J</i></span><i>.</i><span style="">:<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is with deep regret that I dissent from the well-written and
exhaustive opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am unable to concur in the light of the
compulsion exerted by the well-settled doctrine that an improvident plea of
guilty, as attested by a host of decisions of this Court, results in the
conviction being reversible on the ground of denial of procedural due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not suffice, in my
view, to quote from the opinion of the Court, that "in the brief filed by
the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> no assignment of
error was made and, instead, said counsel urged the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The then Solicitor General, now Justice Felix Q. Antonio, did not see any
necessity to submit any brief, a manifestation sufficing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, I cannot subscribe
to the holding "that the death penalty was properly imposed considering
that the accused is a quasi-recidivist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under article 160 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty (reclusion
temporal maximum to death) for the murder committed by him should be imposed in
its maximum period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly noted
by the trial court, his plea of guilty was offset by the aggravating
circumstance of dwelling."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This pronouncement in People v. <span class="SpellE">Espina</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is, to my mind, controlling:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It
only remains to be added that as of 1934, when the [former] Constitution was
drafted, it was already a settled principle of law that where a plea of guilty
is entered in a case that may result in the imposition of the death penalty, it
must be 'made under the conditions indicated, that is to say on arraignment,
freely and voluntarily, as an express admission of the guilt of the accused of
the offense with which he is charged, and with full knowledge of the consequences
and the meaning of his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere
formal plea of "guilty" made under compulsion, or under any condition
other than those just indicated will not suffice.' Such an opinion by Justice
Carson goes back to a 1907 decision, with the same jurist as <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ponente</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>where he would require 'the taking
of testimony' to justify accepting a plea of guilty as 'the proper and prudent
course.' He was much more definite in United States v. <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>,
decided in 1915.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As made clear in such
decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Where the offense charged
then is capital, "the possibility of misunderstanding or mistake in so
grave a matter, justifies and in most instances requires the taking of such
available evidences in support of the allegation of the information as the
trial judge may deem necessary to remove all reasonable possibility that the
accused might have entered his plea of 'guilty' improvidently, or without a
clear and precise understanding of its meaning and effect."' It does not
admit of doubt, therefore, that the due process clause as known to the [1935]
Constitution at the time of its being framed would not be satisfied without the
lower court taking all the necessary steps to satisfy itself as to such a plea
being made under conditions that would demonstrate that the accused is fully
cognizant of the dire consequences that would ensue by such an admission."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> decision goes on to
state:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is undisputed that with
a plea of guilt in a prosecution for capital offense, freely and
understandingly made, with full awareness that one<span style="">'</span><span style="">s</span>
life hangs in the balance, no due process question arises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To all intents and purposes, there was a
hearing before condemnation, a proceeding upon lawful inquiry, with the ensuing
judgment being the necessary consequence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under such circumstances the imposition even of the extreme penalty is
not attended by arbitrariness or unfairness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is done is neither capricious nor oppressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused must be deemed to have yielded
only to the promptings of the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
acknowledgment of guilt is not tainted by any infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Before
that stage is reached, however, the <span style="">civilized
</span>standards of justice do require that he must have reflected on the
action he would take with the assistance of counsel, who could inform him of
what is in store for him if he decides to admit his culpability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, on the other hand, is called
upon to ascertain, invariably through the taking of evidence, what actually did
transpire so that the resulting verdict cannot in any wise be stigmatized as
deficient in terms of what is proper, reasonable, and just.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would thus be the need for the parties
being required by the Court to submit proof on the attendant circumstances,
whether aggravating or mitigating, especially so in the case of the latter as
necessarily the information does not refer to them at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless such a standard is met, due process is
not observed, and the decision cannot be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we have held before; we do so again."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An excerpt from People v. Ramos<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
is likewise relevant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As was set forth in the recent case of
People v. <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'<span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> and the twenty-one cases thereafter
decided in accordance with its categorical requirement that there be due
observance of the fundamental requirements of due process before a plea of guilty
is accorded acceptance speak too plainly for the message to be misread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pay due heed to what they say.' Less than <span style="">six </span>months later, in People v. <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span>, it was stated in the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'In People v. <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>,
promulgated in July of this year, twenty-one other decisions of a similar
character since <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> were noted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last three cases in point, People v. <span class="SpellE">Pohong</span>, People v. <span class="SpellE">Duque</span>, and
People v. <span class="SpellE">Saligan</span> are of even more recent date, the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> in each of them being Justice Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How else could this Court dispose of such
lower court decisions suffering from the corrosion of a grave substantial error
of constitutional dimension?' To complete the picture, it must be noted that
two more decisions to the same effect have been rendered <span style="">in </span>March of this year, People v. <span class="SpellE">Villafuerte</span> and People v. <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is undeniable, therefore, is that from <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span> on, this Court has spoken in words too plain to be
misinterpreted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not be
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional rights of
an accused as well as the accepted canons of procedure so require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dire consequence of a plea of guilty is
such that there must be a showing of a full understanding of what is entailed
before there can be automatic acceptance of such a declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough, a circumstance not shown
here, that counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> had
performed his work diligently and well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is even more imperative that the trial court entrusted by the State
with such a grave responsibility should, by the steps indicated in our above
decisions, satisfy itself that there was a full realization of the fate that
awaits the person on the dock, if there be an admission on his part that he
indeed was responsible for the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only then may a valid sentence be meted out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only then is the law deemed complied
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since this element is lacking in
the case of <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaborne</span>,
we have to grant him a new trial."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is my considered opinion then that the case should be remanded
to the trial court which should proceed in accordance with the procedure laid down
by us in the above cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
dissenting opinion.</p>
