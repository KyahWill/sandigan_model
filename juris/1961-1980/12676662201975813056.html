				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>, had applied to the 
Public Service Commission, in its Case No. 116808, for authority to operate ten 
(10) taxicab units for <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City and from the said city to any point in the island 
Mindanao. Over the opposition of the respondent, C. Lim, a taxicab operator in 
the territory applied for, the Commission, on 5 May 1959, granted the 
petitioner's application.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Apart from the 
foregoing application, the petitioner, and separately with his wife, Asuncion 
II.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Escaño</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> 
had been granted other certificates of public convenience to TPU and AC units. 
The wife holds the active of the business because her husband, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>, is a blind 
man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On motion for reconsideration by 
<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Lim, however, the Commission, on 20 May 
1959, set aside the said decision of 5 May 1959 for the reason that at that time 
the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> had not completed adducing his evidence 
before the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>. Said judge was commissioned by the Commission to 
receive the evidence by deposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Meantime, on 8 September 1959, 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> filed another petition to operate 
the proposed service, pending final determination of his application. On 28 
September 1959, the Commission approved the operation of three 
units.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the evidence of the parties 
before the municipal judge was completed (transcribed from tape-recorded 
testimonies to which manner no objection was raised), and the parties rested 
their respective cases, the Public Service Commission, on 21 December 1959, 
revived its earlier decision of 5 May 1959 and authorized the applicant to 
operate seven (7) more taxi cabs to complete the ten (10) 
units.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But again, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Lim moved, on 21 January to reconsider the order 
of 21 December 1959 on the ground that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> is not qualified <span class="GramE">to</span> operate 
the service applied for by him. In his motion for reconsideration, Lim specified 
the charges made against <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> and his wife by Public 
Service Inspector <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>. These charges refer to the complaints, Nos. 77920-C 
and 77921-C, instituted before the Commission on 16 February 1959 for violation 
of certificates in the TPU and &amp; services. In a joint decision on 24 March 
1960 of the two cases, the Commission found the <span class="SpellE">Escaños</span> guilty allowing third persons to operate their 
vehicles under their certificates for a fee, and forthwith cancelled their &amp; 
TPU and AC certificates; but the <span class="SpellE">Escanos</span> filed a 
motion for reconsideration of the decision and said motion not been 
resolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Acting on Lim's 
motion for reconsideration of 21 January 1960, the three commissioners then 
composing the Commission voted two in favor (Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prieto</span>) and one against 
(Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span>) the grant of the motion in 
separate opinions dated 30 March 1960, 1 April 1960, and 22 March 1960, 
respectively.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
On 12 April 1960, applicant <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> moved to reconsider 
the majority opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Because, in the meantime, 
Republic Act 2077 had increased membership in the Public Service Commission from 
three to five, and the two additional Commissioners had not been appointed, no 
action could be taken on <span class="SpellE">Escaño's</span> motion to 
reconsider. He then moved to be allowed to provisionally operate the seven (7) 
taxicabs that he had acquired prior to the revocation of his permit. By order of 
23 December 1960 (Annex N, Appellant's Brief), the provisional authority was 
granted, the Commission taking into account the damages suffered by the 
applicant through the suspension of the operation of the taxicabs he had 
acquired, the large capital invested, and "that there is no certainty when the 
motion for reconsideration can be finally acted upon." This order was issued by 
the three Qualified and then acting Commissioners, <span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span>, <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prieto</span>, the last two being the very ones who had Previously 
voted to recall the 1959 decision granting <span class="SpellE">Escaño's</span> 
application to operate his taxis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The composition of the Commission 
was thereafter competed on 30 July 1962, and it issued the following order, 
finally resolving adversely <span class="SpellE">Escaño's</span> motion for 
reconsideration (with one commissioner dissenting):<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Considering that the application 
filed by <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> to 
operate a taxicab service dated June 16, 1958 was denied by a majority the 
Commissioners, as may be noted in the separate opinion rendered by Commissioner 
Alejandro A. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> dated March 30, 1960, and the 
opinion of Associate Commissioner Gabriel P. <span class="SpellE">Prieto</span> 
dated April 1, 1960, wherein it is clearly stated that the decision Commission 
dated May 5, 1959 as well as the order of December 21, 1959 should be cancelled 
and set aside; and considering furthermore that said opinions are based on the 
fact that in Case No. 77920-C, the applicant <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>, was found guilty of a serious violation of his 
certificates and was punished accordingly in accordance with law, and 
considering furthermore, that no evidence was presented by the applicant to 
prove that such a finding of fact is not supported by the evidence of record, 
this Commission believes that it has no valid reason to disturb the findings of 
fact of Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prieto</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, the motion for 
reconsideration filed by applicant dated </span><st1:date month="4" day="12" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">12 April 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is 
hereby DENIED, and accordingly, the provisional permit authorized by order of 
this Commission dated </span><st1:date month="12" day="23" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 23, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, is 
Cancelled and Revoked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Applicant is therefore required 
to surrender the Taxi identification plates issued for his taxicabs authorized 
under said provisional permit within twenty (20) days from receipt hereof. If he 
fails to do so, the Motor Vehicles Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City is hereby 
directed to order the recall or confiscation of the 
same."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A motion by <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> for the reconsideration of the above order was 
unanimously denied on 12 December 1962, <span class="GramE">Not</span> satisfied 
with the foregoing orders of 30 July 1962 and 12 December 1962, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> appealed to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find the appeal to be 
meritorious, and agree with petitioner-appellant that it was abuse of discretion 
for the majority of the Commission to penalize him with revocation of his 
taxicab permit upon the basis of a non-final conviction of an alleged violation 
of another and distinct certificate of convenience. It is not disputed that the 
order of 24 March 1960 finding <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> guilty of having 
willfully violated the conditions of his TPU and AC certificates had not yet 
become final, since petitioner's motion to reconsider the same was still <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon, and said could be subject to review by the 
Supreme Court, Furthermore, according to the dissenting opinion of Commissioner 
<span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span> (Petition, Annex P), the said decision of 
conviction "was promulgated without sufficient notice to <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>, who was not given an opportunity to be nor to 
present his evidence." This statement is nowhere contradicted in the record, 
and, if true, the conviction could even he void for lack of due process (cf. 
<span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> <span class="SpellE">Jeepney</span> Operators 
<i>vs</i>. PSC, L-20699, 26 February 1965).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At any rate, not being final, 
said conviction could not constitute a reasonable basis for revoking a totally 
distinct certificate of public convenience to operate a taxi service, especially 
because the nature of this service is different from the TPU and AC services the 
conditions of which are alleged to have been violated. The appealed order of the 
Commission thus imposes a second and distinct penalty for which we find no 
justification. While a violation of the conditions of a certificate entitles the 
Commission to revoke the violated certificate, it was never held that such 
violation alone could also result in the forfeiture of a totally different 
certificate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent Lim charges that the 
decision of 1 April 1960 revoking <span class="SpellE">Escaño's</span> taxicab 
permit had become final because petitioner's motion for reconsideration against 
the order of 30 July 1962, in reality, was a second motion, since the last order 
already denied <span class="SpellE">Escaño's</span> first motion for 
reconsideration of 12 April 1960. We do not agree. It is noteworthy that after 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Escaño's</span> motion of 12 April 1960, seeking 
reconsideration of the revocation of his taxicab permit, <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> was authorized by the Commission, on 30 December 
1960, to operate his second batch of seven taxicabs; this authority, in effect, 
suspended the order of revocation of the certificate. Hence, the order of 30 
July 1962, while denying <span class="SpellE">Escaño's</span> first Motion to 
reconsider, actually was revoking also the order of 30 December 1960. This added 
feature entitled <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span> to ask for reconsideration 
anew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the appealed orders of 30 March 
and </span><st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">1 April
