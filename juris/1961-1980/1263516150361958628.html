Arroyo and other heirs of the late Ignacio Arroyo, from the decision of the
Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R.-28555 affirming <span style="">the one </span>rendered by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo in
Civil Case No. 4759 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Arroyo et al., vs.
El <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span> Del <span class="SpellE">Santissimo</span>
Rosario de <span class="SpellE">Molo</span>, et al." holding "that the
plaintiffs have failed to establish fair and reliable basis upon which the
donation in <span class="GramE">question</span> may be justly declared <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>", and, for this reason, dismissing the
case, without costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the Court of Appeals - substantially <span style="">the </span>same as those found by the Court
of First Instance - are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On July 2, 1924, the late Ignacio Arroyo partitioned his
estate <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span> among this three
children Jose Arroyo, Mariano Arroyo and <span class="SpellE">Sor</span> Rosario
(Arroyo) de la <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span> by executing with them a
public instrument called '<span class="SpellE">Convenio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Re­particidn</span> de <span class="SpellE">Bienes</span> y <span class="SpellE">Adjudicacion</span> de <span class="SpellE">Herencia</span>' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '<span class="GramE">A').</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three children also received therein
their inheritance from their deceased mother Maria <span class="SpellE">Pidal</span>,
the first wife of Ignacio Arroyo.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
estate of Ignacio Arroyo was apportioned in four parts, with specified properties
being given to each of the three children, and the remaining properties, likewise
specified, being adjudicated to Ignacio Arroyo, or reserved for <span class="GramE">himself</span>, as comprising his one-third portion of free
disposal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1927" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1927</st1:date>

thereof, was accepted by the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> on the same date
and in the same instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent
documents clarifying the properties subject matter of the donation, and
modifying the conditions imposed thereby, were executed on <st1:date year="1931" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1931</st1:date> and on <st1:date year="1931" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1931</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">‘C’, 'D' and ‘E’<span style="">).</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1931" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1931</st1:date>
Ignacio Arroyo executed his last will and testament (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. 'F').</span> The '<span class="SpellE">Convenio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Reparticion</span>' aforementioned was reproduced in said will as
an integral part thereof, following a statement therein regarding its
execution, and regarding its being confirmed and reproduced therein so that its
validity will never be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
donation in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span> <st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">del</span></st1:place></st1:state> <span class="SpellE">Santissimo</span>

were likewise related in the said will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1935" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1935</st1:date>
Ignacio Arroyo died and his last will and testament was probated, without any
opposition, by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo on <st1:date year="1935" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1935</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1936" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1936</st1:date>
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, as administrator of the intestate
estate of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Gerona, filed an amended
complaint (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘G’) against <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> as executor of Ignacio Arroyo, Jose Arroyo,
Jr. as admi­nistrator of the intestate estate of Jose Arroyo, the <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span> del <span class="SpellE">Santissimo</span> Rosario
de <span class="SpellE">Molo</span> and the Municipality of Iloilo, docketed as
Civil Case No. 9137 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, seeking the re­covery,
<u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, of one-half of the proper­ties
adjudicated to Jose Arroyo and Mariano Arroyo in the '<span class="SpellE">Convenio</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Reparticion</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A')
and one-half of the properties donated to the <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span>
<st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">del</span></st1:place></st1:state> <span class="SpellE">Santissimo</span> Rosario de <span class="SpellE">Molo</span> in the
'<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Donacion</span>' <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B').<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The court rendered judgment against
the defendants, but cleared the <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span> and the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename></st1:place> from any liability, and
refrained from disturbing the status of the properties donated to them,
reserving the right of the plaintiff to claim from the executor of Ignacio
Arroyo one-half of the value of these donated properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Arroyos appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court but war destroyed the re­cords of the case, so that a new trial
was or­dered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. 9137 of the
Court of First <span style="">Instance </span>of
Iloilo was then tried anew, but on <st1:date year="1949" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1949</st1:date>, the plaintiffs there­in and <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Arroyo as <span class="SpellE">adminis­tratrix</span> of the intestate estate of Jose Arroyo
entered into an agreement whereby the former renounced and waived in favor of
the latter all their rights and interests on any and all the properties therein
litigated in consideration of the sum of P65<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
and the assumption of the obligation to pay the attorney's fees of the counsel
of the plaintiffs in the sum of P40,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">‘M-1’).</span> Upon motion of both parties the Court of First
Instance dismissed the complaint <span class="SpellE">in'Civil</span> Case No.
9137 on the same date (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'R').</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="13" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 13, 1958</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
<span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> de Arroyo and her children, as the heirs of
Jose Arroyo, filed the complaint in this case, seeking declaration of the
donation made by Ignacio Arroyo to the <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span> del <span class="SpellE">Santissimo</span> Rosario de <span class="SpellE">Molo</span> in
1928 as <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span> and to recover the excess
thereof. The principal defendant is the <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span> <st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">del</span></st1:place></st1:state> <span class="SpellE">Santissimo</span>
Rosario de <span class="SpellE">Molo</span>, although the estate of <span class="SpellE">Sor</span> Rosario (Arroyo) de la <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span>
and the heirs of Mariano Arroyo were <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as
defendants for being allegedly unwilling co-plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="3">March

which plaintiffs answered on <st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="4">April 14,
 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial,
decision was rendered on August 29, 1960, dismissing the complaint for failure
of the plaintiffs to establish fair and reasonable basis upon which the
donation in question may be justly declared <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The counterclaim was likewise
dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After <span style="">a </span>careful consideration of the foregoing facts, the trial court
held "that the plaintiffs have failed to establish fair and reasonable
basis upon which the donation in question may be justly declared <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>"(Record on Appeal p. 168).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its part, the Court of Appeals affirmed
the decision of the trial court because, in its opinion, "the decision
appealed from does not err in finding no fair and reasonable basis for
declaring the <span class="SpellE">Beaterio</span> donation <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the decision of the Court of Appeals, the lone
assignment of error submitted by the appellants in their brief argued "for
the sufficiency of plaintiffs-appellants evidence as a fair and reasonable
basis for resting a finding that the donation in question is <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear, therefore, that the only issue submitted to <span class="GramE">said</span> court, and by it decided, was purely one of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this connection it is
a matter removed from dispute that <span class="GramE">We</span> can review
decisions of the Court of Appeals only on errors of law, its findings of fact
being conclusive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A question of law has been declared as one not calling for the
examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties (<span class="SpellE">Goduco</span> vs. Court of Appeals et al., 63 <span class="GramE">Off</span>.

Edition, p. 412) are to the effect that “For a question to be one of law, it
must involve no examination of the <span class="SpellE">provative</span> value of
the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In a
case similar to the </span><span style="">one at bar </span><span style="">(Lim vs. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Calaguas</span></span><span style="">, G. R. No.</span></span><span style="">
L-2031, May 30, 1949, 40 O.G., 11 Supp. 247, 83 Phil. 796) <span class="GramE">We</span>
held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Our review should be confined to the facts and circumstances
found by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we
agree that such facts and circumstances in this case do not sustain the <span class="GramE">theory</span> of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed it <span style="">is </span>seriously to be doubted whether we could reverse the
conclusion of the appellate court <u><span style="">to
the effect that those facts and circumstances are not ‘enough evidence’ to show
clearly and beyond doubt that the parties intended the contract to be a
mortgage instead of a conditional conveyance</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That conclusion <span style="">is </span>obviously
ONE OF FACT, not a bit different from the verdict of a jury in <span style="">a </span>murder
trial that the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution has proved,
or has not proved that the accused had killed the deceased.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In disputes of this nature, the pivotal inquiry is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do the circumstances show beyond doubt that
the parties made a contract different from the express terms of the document
they signed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the evidence clear,
convincing and satisfactory that the deal was a mortgage instead of a sale with
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pacto</span></u></span><u><span style=""> de retro</span></u><span style="">?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Cuyugan</span> v. Santos 34 Phil 100; <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
v. Gonzales, 50 Phil 558).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That
query necessarily invites calibration of the whole 'evidence', considering</u><u><span style=""> </span>mainly the credibi­lity of witnesses,
existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation
to each other and to the whole and the probabili­ties of the situation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently the question must be deemed <u>factual</u>
for the Appeals' Court to solve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the United States where questions of law are for the jury,
it is held that if the question whether a given transaction amounts to a
conditional sale or mere mortgage depends upon written instru­ments alone, it
is a question for the court; but if extraneous evidence <span style="">is </span>required or received for the
purpose of ascertaining the real intention of the parties, the question is for
the jury (41 C.J. 361 citing many <span style="">cases, </span>particularly <span class="SpellE">Bogk</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Gasset</span>, 149 U.S. 17, Howard v. <span class="SpellE">Kopperl</span>,
74 Tex. 194; 5 SW 627 and <span class="SpellE">Kinnert</span> v. Strong, 103 <span style="">Wis. </span>70; 79
<span style="">N.W. </span>32)
and 'an issue involving determination of the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> intent of a person or persons with respect to acts done
by them is <span style="">a
</span>question of fact for the jury. <span class="GramE">(64 C.J. 365)."</span>
(<span class="GramE">underlining</span> ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In <span class="SpellE">Rapatan</span> vs. Chicano, G. R. No.</span></span><span style=""> L-13828, February 25, 1960, <span class="GramE">We</span> likewise said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"But the trial court did not merely dismiss the complaint,
proceeded to receive evidence on the counterclaim of defendants. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In this respect the trial court said 'With
respect to the counterclaim alleged in the amended answer of the said
defendants, the preponderance of evidence discloses that the imputations
contained in the complaint that the late <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span>
G. Chicano, husband of <span class="SpellE">Coleta</span> de Chicano and father
of <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> Chicano had acquired the land in question
from the plaintiffs through fraud and that the said defendants 'taking
advantage of the ignorance of the plaintiffs herein managed fraudulently to
transfer the tax declaration of the land in question in the name of the
plaintiffs to the name of defendants, are false, malicious and defamatory to
the memory of the late <span class="SpellE">Escolastico</span> Chicano and the
reputation of his heirs, <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> Chicano and <span class="SpellE">Coleta</span> de Chicano, thus causing the latter mental anguish,
besmirched, reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock and simi­lar injuries,'
and accordingly, ordered plaintiffs to pay the sum of P5,000.00 as moral
damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that <u>the foregoing finding is a question of
fact which involves an evaluation of the evidence</u> and the same is now
assigned as error, we are of the opinion that this case comes within the
appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing it is clear that petitioners now
seek a reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals not upon a question of
law but upon one of fact - one which necessarily involves the examination of
the probative value of the evidence presented by <span class="GramE">them</span>,
it being their contention that such evidence, which the Court of Appeals
precisely held to be insufficient to justify the granting of the relief sought,
is, in fact, sufficient for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, petitioners seek to have <span class="GramE">Us</span>
substitute our judgment in lieu of that of the Court of Appeals in the
resolution-of a question of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">But to avoid the necessarily fatal application of the well
settled rule on the matter, petitioners' lone assignment of <span style="">error </span>in the brief submitted to Us
attempts to state the issue <span style="">somewhat </span>differently,
saying that the Court of Appeals "gravely erred in not declaring the
donation in question <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span> and in not ordering
the return to petitioners of the excess thereof".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re-stating the issue at page 2 of their brief
they submit again that "the only question presented in this appeal is
whether the conclusions of the Honorable Court of Appeals drawn from the
undisputed facts are correct or not".</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' obvious effort to show in this manner that the Court
of Appeals committed errors of law is unavailing, because for Us to hold that,
upon the evidence of record, the questioned donation is <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>,
We must necessarily weigh or evaluate their evidence and hold that - contrary
to the opinion of the Court of Appeals - that evidence is of sufficient
probative value to show that the questioned donation is <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the authorities relied upon by petitioners
do not support their contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">What we said in Manila Railroad Company vs. Attorney General, 41
Phil 160, 169, is simply to the effect that a witness who personally knows the
land sought to be expropriated because he had possessed it as owner or had
administered it or lived on it for a long time, or because he had bought and
sold much land situated in the same municipality, or had been engaged in
farming and business and had therefore acquired experience and knowledge of the
value of lands in the locality, is <u>competent</u> to testify on the value of
said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold that a particular
person is <u>competent</u> to testify upon a given matter does not mean that
his testimony upon the same must be <u>believed</u> by the Court or must be
deemed by the latter to be of sufficient probative value to establish the point
which it was intended to prove.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Competency as a witness is one thing, and it is another to be a credible
witness, so credible that the Court must accept what he says.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the decision subject of review
clearly shows that the Court of Appeals did not hold that witness <span class="SpellE">Doromal</span> was not a competent witness in relation to the
value of the properties involved in the questioned donation; it simply declined
to believe his testimony or to give it probative value sufficient to prove what
petitioners were trying to establish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Had the Court of Appeals considered him not to be a competent witness
upon that matter, it would have completely ignored or disregarded his testimony
instead of weighing it or evaluating it; this, however, resulting in the Court
arriving at the conclusion that such evidence did not have sufficient probative
value to convince the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The passages quoted from 20 American Jurisprudence, p. 749-750
and 755 are likewise in support of the proposition that "professional
appraisers and dealers engaged in the business of buying and selling similar
property are <u>competent</u> to testify as to value" or are
"competent to express his (their) judgment as to its value".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">To say that a particular
witness <span style="">"is
</span>competent to express his judgment" as to the value <span style="">of </span>particular properties is manifestly
a far cry from the proposition that because he is competent to express such
judgment, the Court must necessarily accept and believe his testimony.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court - particularly trial courts - may <span style="">allow </span>a person to testify as a witness
upon a given matter because he is competent but may thereafter decide whether
to believe or not to believe his testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the Court of Appeals refusal to believe or to be bound
by the testimony of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> Vt. de Arroyo because "a sale between brothers
can not be a reliable index of the fair market value of a property", petitioners
now contend that there is no evidence at all that the deceased Jose <span style="">Arroyo </span>(late husband of said
petitioner) or the deceased Mariano Arroyo were trying to help one another when
they executed the deed of conveyance involving one-half share of Haciendas
"<span class="SpellE">Manolita</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>"
in favor of the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This obviously
raises the same question of whether or not the Court of Appeals committed any
error in evaluating the testimony of the witness already named - a question
purely of fact which <span class="GramE">We</span> are not authorized to review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from
is affirmed, with costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
