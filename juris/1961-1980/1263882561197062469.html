<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner Antonio <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>, for himself and in behalf
of his minor daughter, Girlie C. <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>, filed a
claim for disability and death benefit on account of the illness and ensuing
death of Maxima C. <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1975</st1:date>,
the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. 7, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
rendered a decision awarding claimant disability benefit, as well as death
benefit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1976</st1:date>,
or after the lapse of 3 months and 4 days, the Solicitor General filed a
petition for relief from judgment and to elevate the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent Commission rendered a decision reversing that of Regional Office No.
7, absolving the respondent Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from liability <span style="">under the Workmen's
Compensation Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent Commission
concluded, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The deceased started to be on official sick leave of absence
on <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="6"><span style="">June </span>4, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span style="">it </span>will be noted
that the two (2) months before that <span style="">comprised
</span>(of) <span style="">the long vacation period
for public school teachers, and </span>deceased had no record of leave of
absence for that aforesaid period of vacation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, there is also no showing that before the long vacation period
for public schools, deceased filed any sick <span class="GramE">leave,</span>
hence, this is proof that she had no illness when the long vacation
started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are constrained to believe
that she started to acquire her illness and cause of death (sic) while on
vacation, and hence, there is no causal relation to employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is bolstered by the further
detail that deceased finally died on September 30, 1974, over a year after she
went on official leave, which is definitely too long for a brain tumor patient
to survive.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is thus valid ground(s) to reverse the referee's decision,
as the late Maxima died on September 30, 1974, and thus, her death did not
arise out of or in the course of her employment, since she did not return to
work after the long vacation for public schools and her illness lasted until
the natural progress thereof did result in death and, hence, the employment
factor has completely nothing to do with said illness or death" (pp.
16-17, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>This conclusion of the Commission is contrary
to the findings of </span>the hearing officer of Regional Office No. 7 of the Department
of Labor that:</p>

<blockquote>"The late <span style="">Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> was in the government service as a classroom teacher
of the Ides Elementary School, </span><span class="SpellE">Kiblawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, from September 23,
1970 <span style="">to </span>September 30, 1974 when
she died, receiving a last salary of P3,792.00 per annum (service record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the first <span style="">two years in the service, she began to complain </span>of
dizziness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1973, she complained about
her eyes and, after an examination, began <span style="">to
</span>use glasses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite her <span style="">sufferings, she continued reporting to
classes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the following vacation,
she came to </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bohol</span></span></st1:place><span style="">,
where she came from, for medical treatment and went on sick leave beginning </span><st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="6"><span style="">June 4,
 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="6"><span style="">June 18, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, she gave birth to a 'baby girl' at the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bohol</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Provincial</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About a month after such delivery she vomited and complained of a severe
pain in her head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was admitted to
the </span><st1:place><st2:sn><span style="">Saint</span></st2:sn><span style=""> </span><st2:middlename><span style="">Jude</span></st2:middlename><span style=""> </span><st2:sn><span style="">Hospital</span></st2:sn></st1:place><span style=""> and treated by Dr. Ramiro for '<span class="SpellE">cerebro</span>-vascular
accident'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her blood pressure was high
and her condition did not improve despite medication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Six
</span><span style="">months later, she became
completely blind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confused with her
failing health, her husband, the herein claimant, took her to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> for further medical treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was admitted to the </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> (Velez) </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">General</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="9"><span style="">September 29, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr.
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> was her attending physician and
diagnosed her sickness as 'brain tumor'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the following day, she died of 'cardio respiratory arrest </span>due
to brain tumor<span style="">'</span>" (pp.
19-20, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion of respondent Commission that the illnesses of the
deceased were not service-connected has no basis in fact and in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased complained of dizziness after
the first two years of her service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">And in 1973, she also complained </span>about
her eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that such
dizziness and deteriorating eyesight could be the symptoms of her sickness that
caused her death, inasmuch as six months after she was treated for <span class="SpellE">cerebro</span>-vascular accident, she became completely
blind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was admitted to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1974</st1:date>, Dr. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span>
diagnosed her sickness as "brain tumor".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, she died of
"cardio respiratory arrest due to brain tumor".</p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that the sickness of Maxima C. <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> that ultimately caused her death is <span style="">service-connected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that when she </span>contracted
her sickness it was during the long summer vacation, yet she was still under
the employ of the government and there existed an employee-employer
relationship, although teachers do not report for duty during this period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another point raised by the petitioner-claimant is that the
petition for relief from judgment of the Solicitor General was filed out of
time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted that on <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="10">October
 3, 1975</st1:date>, the Office of the Solicitor General received the copy of
the referee's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it was only
on <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1976</st1:date>, or after
a lapse of 96 days, that the Solicitor General filed his petition for relief
and to elevate the record of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the rule, the referee's decision becomes final fifteen (15) days
after receipt of the decision unless a timely motion for reconsideration is
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the petition of the
Solicitor General was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, on <st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="3">March
 18, 1976</st1:date>, respondent Commission sitting <u>en</u> <span class="GramE"><u>banc</u>,</span> issued a resolution denying the petition to
elevate records for relief from judgment filed by the Solicitor General on the
ground that the Commission has no longer any jurisdiction to review the
referee's decision (Annex "A", p. 29, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">While WE appreciate the fact that the Office of the Solicitor General
is saddled with numerous cases as it is the counsel for the government and its
agencies and instrumentalities, heavy pressure of work is not one of the
grounds for a petition for relief from judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, realizing <span style="">this fact, the Office of the Solicitor General had already anticipated
such a contingency by devising mimeographed forms for such petition in much the
same way that it has a mimeographed form for </span>motions for extension of
time to file court pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A death or
disability compensation claim constitutes one of the vital aspects of the
social justice guarantee of the Constitution, to which the government,
including the Solicitor General and his staff, must always adhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the necessitous man and his heirs, time
is of the essence.</p>
