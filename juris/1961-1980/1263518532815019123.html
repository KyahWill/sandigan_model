				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila (in Civil
Case No. 68028), is appealed to this Court by Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>,
a Chinese citizen, raising the issue of the qualification of a non-Filipino citizen
to lease <span class="GramE">land</span> previously expropriated by the
Government for resale to its <u><span style="">bona
fide</span></u> tenants and occupants and to other qualified persons, under the
provisions of Republic Act 1162, as amended by Republic Act 1599.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case arose from the denial by the Land Tenure Administrati<span style="">on </span>(now
replaced by Land Authority) of the application of Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>,
a <span style="">Chinese to
lease four-lots </span>(Nos. 19, 20, 21, and 24, Block No. 3) <span style="">of the <span class="SpellE">Fabie</span> Estate in </span><span class="SpellE">Paco</span>,
Manila which was purchased by the govern<span style="">ment in 1955 to </span>be subdivided into small lots
for <span style="">re</span>sale to <span style="">its </span><u><span style="">bona </span></u><u><span style="">fide</span></u><span style=""> tenants and </span>occupants and to other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The denial of the afore<span style="">mentioned
application </span>was based on the fact that, although applicant <span style="">Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> was </span><span style="">able </span><span style="">to </span>establish that she was the tenant of the
lots applied <span style="">for
</span><span style="">even
prior to </span><span style="">the government's acquisition </span>of the Estate, her application to
lease the same was filed with the Land Tenure Administration only on 21 October
1957, or after the said lots had been allocated to other parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty's</span> <span style="">claim to Priority in </span>the lease of the lots
was also rejected, for the reason that under the law, the privilege to lease
lands expropriated by the government for resale may be availed of only by
tenants or occupants qualified to purchase, but <span style="">who are not</span> <span style="">financially capable at the </span>start of
purchasing at cost the lot or lots occupied by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And applicant Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>
is not such tenant or occupant qualified to buy the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by the applicant, the President, through the Assistant
Executive Secretary, affirmed the <span style="">ruling of the </span>Land Tenure
Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that
although the <span style="">applicant
may not be considered </span>disqualified by the fact of her Chinese
citizenship, <span style="">the
legal prohibition </span>against alien acquisition of real property being
directed against the purchase thereof and not to a mere leasing of the same,
Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty's</span> application had to be denied because it was
filed after the lots applied for had been allocated to other applicants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the decision stated, investigation
disclosed that applicant Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> was not an occupant
of the area applied for; in fact, no construction existed thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The appli</span>cant was staying in a building
adjacent to the <span style="">lots in </span><span class="GramE">question,</span> and originally owned by
her but which she later sold to <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Chua de
Ayala.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her motion for
reconsideration of the President's decision was denied, Tan <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>
instituted <i>certiorari</i> proceeding <span style="">in </span>the Court of First Instance of Manila
(Civil Case No. 68028), charging the Land Tenure Administration (whose
functions were taken over by the Land Authority) of having committed grave
abuse of discretion in allocating Lots Nos. 19, 20, 21 and 24 of Block 3 of the
<span class="SpellE">Fabie</span> Estate to other persons, thus depriving
petitioner of her property rights thereto without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the <st1:place><st1:placename>respondents</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Land</st1:placetype></st1:place> Authority and Executive
Secretary had filed their <span class="GramE">answers,</span> and the parties
their respective memoranda, the case was submitted for judgment on the
pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="7">5 July
 1967</st1:date>, the court ruled that petitioner, being a Chinese and therefore
disqualified to purchase the disputed lots, is equally without qualification to
lease the same, the right to lease, under the law, arising merely from the
applicant's right to purchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her claim
that she was deprived of the right to equal protection of the law was,
likewise, overruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court declared
that the equal protection clause is not without limitations; that there are
rights that the law reserves only <span style="">to Filipino </span>citizens, such as the right of
suffrage, the right to hold public office, to operate public services and
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to own lands is one of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicant moved to reconsider
this decision, and when <span style="">it was denied,
she interposed the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court could not have ruled otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, appellant is not qualified to <span style="">p</span>urchase<span style=""> </span>the land involved in the<span style="">
</span>cas<span style="">e</span> on account of her
Chinese <span style="">citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She insists, however, that as <u>bona fide</u>
tenant thereof, she </span>is entitled<span style=""> </span>t<span style="">o</span> lease the<span style=""> </span>property, citing in support of her allegation <span style="">Section 3 of
Republic Act 1162,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as amended </span>by
Re<span style="">public Act
1599, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">"SEC.
3.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The landed </span>estates or haciendas <span style="">expropriated by </span>virtue of this A<span style="">c</span>t shall be subdivided into small
lots, none of which shall exceed one hundred and fifty square meters in area,
to be <span style="">sold at cost to the tenants, or
occupants, of said lots, and to other individuals, in the order mentioned; <u>Provided</u>,
That if </span><span style="">the tenant </span><span style="">of <span style="">any
</span></span><span style="">given
lot is not able </span><span style="">to purchase said lot, he shall be given a lease from month to month of
said lot until such time that he is able to purchase the same: <u>Provided</u>,
further, That in the event of lease the rentals that may be charged by the
Government shall not exceed eight per cent per </span><span style="">annum of the assessed valuation of the property leased."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The legal provisions <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> is too
clear to cause any confusion or diverging interpretations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pervading aim of the law which properly
should guide the construction to be placed on any of its <span class="GramE">provisions,</span>
is <span style="">for</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the State to provide
home lots to its citizens, to enable them </span>to own at <span style="">least the land </span><span style="">o</span><span style="">n w</span><span style="">h</span><span style="">ich
their houses are built.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henc</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">,
</span>the <span style="">mandate
to the administration </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">o acquire lan</span><span style="">d</span><span style="">ed estates, break them </span><span style="">up</span><span style=""> into small lots not</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">exceeding 150 square meters in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">area, for resale </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">cost to the tenants or occupants thereof, not
to other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if a tenant is in </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">position to buy the lot he is occupying at the time of its </span><span style="">acquisition by the government, the </span><span style="">l</span><span style="">aw
even grants him the privilege to </span><span style="">lease
the same from the government on monthly basis, "until such time that he is
able to purchase the same”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other
conclusion can be derived from th</span><span style="">e
provision than that the lease mentioned therein </span><span style="">can be availed of only by one who is qualified, but is in no financial
position for the present to buy the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It certainly would not justify the lease of </span>the lots <span style="">to non-Philippine citizens, notwithstanding
the fact that they may have really been the tenants thereon even prior </span>to
<span style="">t</span>he acquisition <span style="">of the expropriated property by the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To extend to these </span><span style="">aliens the benefit of the first proviso of
Section 3 of Republic Act No. 1162 <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>,
notwithstanding their </span><span style="">permanent disability </span><span style="">to
acquire </span><span style="">title to land under the Constitution, would result in </span><span style="">their acquiring pos</span><span style="">session in
perpetuity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not only
incompatible with the essential temporary nature in law of </span><span style="">a contract of lease, but, </span><span style="">in effect, would be
</span><span style="">a </span><span style="">violation </span><span style="">of the Constitutional inhibition.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For a perpetual lease of </span>land would be practically <span class="GramE">an alienation</span> thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant
asks whether the p</span>rovision as thus construed would not <span style="">constitute </span>a
<span style="">deprivation
of appellant's right to </span>property without due process of law, or amount
to a denial <span style="">to
appellant, a resident </span>of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
of the equal <span style="">protection
</span>guarantee of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered in this connection that the fact alone that
the law withdraw from non-Filipinos the enjoyment of certain rights exclusively
reserved to Philippine citizens does not expose <span style="">such law to charges of constitutional
infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For classification will
constitute no violation of </span>the individual's <span style="">right </span>to equal protection as long as <span style="">it is not </span>unreasonable, arbitrary or
capricious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The established and
recognized <span style="">principle
</span>is that classification is not unreasonable where it is based on
substantial distinctions that make real differences, is germane to the aim and
purpose of the law, is not limited to existing conditions, and it applies
equally to all members of the same class, under similar conditions.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
A legislation that affects a particular class would not infringe the consti­tutional
guarantee of equal protection of the laws, provided said statute applies
uniformly and without discrimination to everyone of that class.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, a classification based on citizenship is more than
justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement <span style="">that lots in </span>an
expropriated estate shall be leased only <span style="">to those </span><span style="">who are </span><span style="">qualified in law </span>to buy the same can hardly be considered
unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act 1162 was not
enacted to allow the government to <span style="">go into </span>the <span style="">real estate </span><span style="">business, </span>by leasing <span style="">lots to </span>those who desire and <span style="">can afford </span>to
rent.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is rather aimed at giving realization</span>
and meaning to the policy <span style="">of </span>the State to <span style="">provide </span>land for the landless citizens and enabling <span style="">them to acquire home-lots at minimum
cost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the measure of reason</span>ableness
is reached.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be seriously contended that <span style="">by the government's
denial of appellant's application to lease </span>the lots, and their
allocation in favor of other persons, appellant was deprived of property rights
without due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was said, not <span style="">inappropriately,
that due process, as a constitutional </span><span style="">mandate, is based on reason.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> No irrationality can be said to characterize
the denial of appellant's application.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her occupancy of the lots as a tenant of the previous owner on a <span style="">month-to-month basis did not </span>confer
upon her any vested right on the property leased that the new owner was bound
to respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And nothing appears on the
record that the government, in exercising the right of eminent domain, had
agreed to respect any existing contract in favor of tenants like the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While appellant may have introduced improvements on the lot
leased, <span style="">by </span>so doing despite
absence of a fixed term, the lessee took the risk of not being able to recoup
the value of said improvements before being compelled to vacate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this mischance, the lessee is solely
responsible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span><span style="">law is </span>clear
that at the expiration of the lease the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> <span style="">is not com</span><span style="">pellable to acquire the improvements made by the lessee (Civil Code of<span style=""> </span>the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, Article 1678).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
