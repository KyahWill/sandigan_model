judgment was on May 9, 1963 rendered by the City Court directing petitioner to
pay respondent "the amount of P380.00 representing unpaid wages of
plaintiff, with legal interest thereon from the filing of this complaint until
fully paid; to pay the further sum of P180.00 representing holiday and overtime
wages; to pay the amount of P50.00 as attorney's fees, aside from the costs of
this suit." Notice of the foregoing decision was received by petitioner on
<st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioner moved for <i>a </i>reconsideration of the decision and/or new
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following June 4,
respondent City Judge denied the motion in an order, notice of which was
received by petitioner on June 14, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notice of appeal and appeal bond were filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the appellate docket fee was never paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1963</st1:date> respondent City Judge denied appeal for failure to perfect
the same within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of 15 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1963</st1:date>,
respondent Guevara filed a motion for the execution of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This drew from petitioner a "motion for
the reconsideration of the order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1963</st1:date> <u>and</u> opposition to the motion for execution dated <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1963</st1:date>." Petitioner pleaded
excusable negligence and honest mistake for its failure to perfect its appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He annexed to his motion what he would want
to pass on as affidavit of merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
order of <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1963</st1:date>, the
motion for reconsideration was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1963</st1:date>
respondent Judge issued an order of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then went to the Court of First Instance of Manila on <i style="">certiorari</i> and <i style="">mandamus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Target thereof is
the order of <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1963</st1:date>
and all orders of respondent City Judge subsequent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His prayer is for the annulment of all these
orders.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of First Instance of <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="12">Dec­ember 2, 1963</st1:date>, dismissed the
petition with costs against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration having been thwarted, he
appealed direct to this Court from the decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1963</st1:date> and the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1964</st1:date> denying its motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the fact that the appellate court
docket fee required by Section 2, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court was never paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of interest is petitioner's verified motion for reconsideration
of the order of <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1963</st1:date>
(combined with his opposition to the motion for execution dated <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1963</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was accompanied by an affidavit exe­cuted
by petitioner Tomas L. <span class="SpellE">Lanting</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1963</st1:date>, the text of which is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That I am one of the defendants in CIVIL CASE
NO. 97777 of the Municipal Court of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
(Branch II);</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
I was given instructions by my lawyer, Atty. Mariano L. <span class="SpellE">Andrada</span>,
to file the (1) 'NOTICE OF APPEAL' and (2) 'APPEAL BOND' which he prepared on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1963</st1:date> with the aforesaid
court and pay the appellate court docket fee;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
as I was leaving for the province, I instead ordered my messenger to file with
the court the said notice of appeal and appeal bond and pay the corresponding
appellate court docket fee;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
as I am a very busy man, and honestly believing in the efficiency and
trustworthiness of my messenger, I never inquired from him as to whether he had
complied with my aforesaid order, EXCEPT when my lawyer informed me that my
appeal was denied by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My <u>office
messenger said</u> that he was able to file the notice of appeal and appeal
bond <u>but did not pay the appellate court docket fee</u> because the court's
personnel never required him to pay and so <u>he said</u>, he believed and
concluded that it is not required after all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon inquiry he <u>informed me</u> that he sent the amount of P30.00 I
gave him to his mother because, according to him, he received a letter from his
sister informing him that their mother is ill, and that was on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1963</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
I honestly believe that con­sidering the facts and circumstances which were not
disputed, the applicable law and decided cases support my contention that I am
not liable to the plaintiff's claim."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For two reasons, the judgment and order under review must be
affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The excuse given
for the failure to pay the appellate court docket fee is unacceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is appel­lant's duty and that of his
attorney to see to it that the appeal is perfected within the time limit so
markedly set forth in the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
perfect an appeal payment of the appellate docket fee is a prerequisite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is elementary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, petitioner averred that it was he
who was ins­tructed by his lawyer to file the notice of appeal and the appeal
bond and to pay the appellate court docket fee; that petitioner in turn gave
this job to his messenger as he was leaving for the province; and that
petitioner was "a very busy man" who believed "in the efficiency
and trustworthi­ness" of his messenger to do the work his lawyer entrusted
to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But all these constitute, in the
words of Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, "the most hackneyed and habitual
subterfuge employed by litigants who fail to observe the procedural
requirements prescribed by the Rules of Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor are we to be carried away by petitioner's said affidavit that
his messenger told him that he "did not pay the appellate docket fee
because the court's personnel never required him to pay." For which
reason, the messenger told petitioner, that he "believed and concluded
that it is not required after all." This statement is hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so patently unsubstantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse than this is the further statement in
petitioner's affidavit that according to pe­titioner, upon inquiry, his
messenger also informed him that he sent that amount of P30.00 - intended for
appellate court docket fee - to his (messenger's) mother because
"according to him, he received a letter from his sister informing him that
their mother is ill, and that was on June 23, 1963." This last one, like
the others, is no valid excuse at all: not for the lawyer; not for petitioner;
not for the messenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It demonstrates
gross unconcern on the part of all three.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 5
of the affidavit heretofore transcribed was written in an effort to show that
peti­tioner had a good defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
paragraph 5 contains nothing more than an averment couched in <span class="SpellE">conclusionary</span> terms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner there merely said that he believed that "considering the
facts and circumstances which are not disputed, the applicable law and the
decided cases," - without spelling them out - he was not liable to
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such affidavit does not
contain an averment of facts constituting a valid defense and is not the one
contemplated by the Rules.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, petitioner's own brief before this court recites
stipulation between the parties, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"That plaintiff was on order of the <span class="SpellE">Lanting</span>
Watchman and Security Agency made to render ser­vice in guarding houses
contracted for construction by Antonio Francisco; that Antonio Francisco would
pay <span class="SpellE">Lanting</span> Watchman and Security Agency for the
security services and in turn <span class="SpellE">Lanting</span> Watchman and
Security Agency would pay Guevara his corresponding wages for guarding the
houses under construction by Antonio Francisco."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Correctly, did the respondent City Judge in his decision declare
that "plaintiff's (respondent Guevara's) relation with defendant
(petitioner) is direct and proximate" and that said petitioner
"contracted in his own name with Francisco." Appeal would then be a
waste of effort.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the reasons given</b>, the judgment and order under review
are affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs shall be paid by
petitioner.</p>
