				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 13, 1962, the Department
of Foreign Affairs informed the Commissioner of Immigration that, on the basis
of </span><span style="">the findings made by the
National Bureau of Investigation, </span><span style="">the
signatures of former Secretary of Foreign Affairs, <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span>
M. Serrano, on certain documents, amongst them cable authorization No. 2230-V
(File No. 23617) authorizing the documentation of <span class="SpellE">Beato</span>
Go <span class="SpellE">Callano</span> and others, were not authen</span><span style="">tic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the Department declared several documents - amongst </span><span style="">them the cable authorization just mentioned -
to be null, void and of no </span><span style="">effect,
and the documentation made by </span><span style="">the
Philippine Consulate General at <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> pursuant </span><span style="">to said </span><span style="">cable authorization consisting of the </span><span style="">certificates of </span><span style="">regis</span><span style="">tration and </span><span style="">identity issued to </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Beato</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Go <span class="SpellE">Callano</span> and his
bro</span><span style="">thers Manuel, Gonzalo and
Julio for travel to the Philippines </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All this was done without previous </span><span style="">notice served nor hearing granted to </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">said</span></span><span style=""> parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 21 of the same
year, the Board of Immigration Commissioners, exercising its power of review
under Section 27 (b) of Commonwealth Act No. 613, as amended, issued, also
without any previous notice and hearing, an order reversing the decision of the
Board of Special Inquiry dated January 4, 1962, admitting <span class="SpellE">Beato</span>
and his three brothers for entry as citizens; ordering their exclusion <u>as</u>
<u>aliens</u> not properly documented for admission </span><span style="">pursuant to Section 27 (a)(17) of </span>the <span style="">P</span>hilippine Immigration Act of 1940, as
amended, and ordering that they be returned to the port whence they came or to
the country of which they were nationals, upon the ground that they had been
able "to enter this country and gain admission as Filipino citizens by the
fraudulently secured authorization." On the same date (August 21, 1962)
the Commissioner of Immigration issued a warrant of exclusion <span style="">commanding </span>the deportation officer
"to carry out the exclusion of the above-named applicants (the Go <span class="SpellE">Callano</span> brothers) on the first available transportation and
on the same class of accommodation in which they arrived to the port whence
they came or to the country of which they are nationals."</p>

<p class="BODY">The warrant of exclusion, for one reason or another, was not
served immediately upon the parties ordered deported, who, on November 16,
1962, filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila <span style="">an action for </span>injunction to restrain the Board of Immi­gration
Commissioners <span style="">and the Commissioner of
Immigration from </span>executing the order of exclusion or deportation already
men­tioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They based their action on
the following gr<span style="">ounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(1) that the Board had no jurisdiction
to exclude them from the<span style=""> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> because they were not </span><u><span style="">aliens</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">but Filipino citizens,
and (2) that the order of exclusion was issued by the Board without due process
and in violation of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Months later, the Court of First Instance issued a writ </span><span style="">of pre­</span><span style="">liminary injunction restraining the respondents in the case from
deporting the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial,
the Court ren­dered judgment finding that, according to petitioners' undis</span><span style="">puted evidence, "the petitioners herein
are the illegitimate children of <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Callano</span>, a Filipino citizen, with her common law husband -
a Chinese citizen", and concluding that "until </span><span style="">the petitioners left for China in 1947, they
must be considered as citizens of the Philippines as they were born of a
Filipino mother and an alien father who, however, was not married to their
mother."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the above finding and conclusion, however, the
Court dismissed the case holding that "the petitioners are citizens of the
Republic of China and not being properly docu­mented for entry into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as found by the Immigration Commissioner, the writ of preliminary injunction
hereto­fore issued by this Court shall be deemed dissolved upon fi­nality of
this decision." The grounds upon which the Court <span style="">based its decision were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
because petitioners stayed in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> for a period of fifteen years before
returning to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, they must be considered as citizens of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Chinese</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Republic</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">; (2) as petitioners were recognized by their
alien father as his children, they became Chinese citizens under the Chinese
law of nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the Court also
found that the cable authorization mentioned here­tofore was a forgery, it held
that, for the purpose of the petition before it, "it was immaterial to
determine the <span class="SpellE">genuiness</span> or falsity of the cable
authorization.", "For if the petitioners are Filipino citizens, they
are entitled to remain within the territorial jurisdiction of the Republic in
whatever way they might have entered."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the denial of
herein respondents' motion for reconsideration, they appealed to the Court of
Appeals where they raised the following issues:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) that being Filipino citizens by birth, they did not lose their
citizenship nor acquire Chinese citizenship, neither by their prolonged stay in
China nor by their alleged recognition by their Chinese father, and (b) that
the cablegram authorization was not a forgery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In due
time the Court of Appeals rendered the decision now under review </span><span style="">by </span><i style=""><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style="">, reversing that of the lower court.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Like the court of origin,
the Court of Appeals found that the herein respondents were the illegitimate
children of Go <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> Lin, a Chinese citizen, and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Callano</span>, a Filipino
citizen, who started living <span class="SpellE">maritally</span> in <span class="SpellE">Malitbog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, in 1934; that
out of their illegitimate union were born the fol­lowing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Beato</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Sugod</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, on September 28,
1936; Manuel, in <span class="SpellE">Libagon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
on June 17, 1941, Gonzalo, in <span class="SpellE">Malitbog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, on April 17, 1943 and Julio, in <span class="SpellE">Malitbog</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, on January 31, 1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of Appeals also found
that in 1946, Go <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> Lin, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
and their four sons went to </span><st1:place><st1:city><span style="">Amoy</span></st1:city><span style="">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="">China</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="">, on vacation, but Go died there the same
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1948, <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span>
had to return to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> as the maid of Consul <span class="SpellE">Eutiquio</span>
Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> because she was penniless, leaving her
children behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently the latter
were able to go to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> where they sought and
obtained employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1961, they
applied with the Philippine Consul General in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
for entry into the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> as Filipino citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 12 of that year, the Consulate
received a cablegram from the Department of Foreign Affairs authorizing it to
investigate whether the petitioners for entry were the illegitimate children of
<span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Callano</span>, a Filipino
citizen, and, if satisfied, after a thorough screening, to issue the
corresponding document certifying that they were Filipino citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Consulate made thereafter the appro­priate
investigation, and on the basis of the evidence presented consisting of the
sworn statements of the applicants, their birth certificates and blood test
reports, said office issued late that month a certificate of registration and
identity to the effect that the applicants had submitted sufficient evi­dence
of their citizenship and identity and had been allowed </span>to register in
the Consulate as Filipino citizens and to travel directly to the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 26 of the
same year 1961, they arrived in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> by plane from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Immigration Inspector </span>at the
airport was of the opinion that their travel documents did not constitute
conclusive proof of citizenship, he referred their case to the Board of Special
Inquiry No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon the latter
conducted an investigation at which the respondents presented oral and documentary
evidence to sustain their right to admission as Filipinos (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">B, D, E and H; pp. 93-98; <span style="">99-100; 101-102; 104 of the Record).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon <span class="GramE">these</span> evidence, the Board on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="1"><span style="">January 4, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, promulgated a decision finding the Go <span class="SpellE">Callano</span> brothers to be the illegitimate children of <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Callano</span>, a Filipino
citizen, and entitled to admission, as they were in fact admitted, as Filipino
citizens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That Go <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> Lin, a <span class="SpellE">chinese</span> citizen, and
<span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Callano</span>, a Filipina,
lived <span class="SpellE">maritally</span> in several municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> since 1934 and that out of their union the four
private res</span>pondents were born, are facts found, after appropriate pro­ceedings,
first, by the Philippine Consulate General in <span class="SpellE">HongKong</span>;
second, by the Board of Special Inquiry who investigated their case in Manila
upon their arrival thereat in 1961; third, by the Court of First Instance of
Manila, and lastly, by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These facts, according to well settled juris­prudence, are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in this appeal by
<i style="">certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this appeal, the Board
of Immigration Commissioners and the Commissioner of Immigration maintain the
following proposi­tions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that, in
view of the fact that the cable authoriza­tion referred to heretofore is a
forgery, all the proceedings had in connection therewith are void and, as a
result, the private respondents must be deported as <u>aliens</u> not properly
documented; (2) that, granting that they were Filipino citizens when they left
the Philippines </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">1946, they lost that
citizen­ship, firstly, by staying in China for a period of fifteen years, and
secondly, because they were recognized by their common-law father, they became
citizens of the Republic of China in accord­ance with the Chinese Nationality
Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of First
Instance of Manila declared the cable­gram authorization a forgery on the
strength of the testimony of Mr. Logan - a handwriting expert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding, however, was reversed by the
Court of Appeals, the pertinent portion of its decision being the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The next question raised by the peti­tioners-appellants is
whether the Government has satisfactorily proved that the signature of the
Secretary of Foreign Affairs on the cable authorizations Exhibit <span class="GramE">1,</span> is a forgery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Felipe P. Logan, chief of the questioned docu­ments division of the National
Bureau of Investi­<span style="">gation, </span>testified
that he made a comparative examination of the signature of the Department
Secretary on Exhibit 1 and the signatures of the same official on the detail
orders, Exhibits 3-G to 3-L, and from the significant differences <span style="">in </span>the writing characteristics which
he observed he concluded that the signature on Exhibit 1 was not written by the
Department Secretary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Before it can be said that the questioned signature is a forgery
there must be competent proof that the specimens are the genuine signa­ture of
the Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to witness,
Logan, he knows that the signatures on the detail orders are "genuine
"because they were submitted to me by an agent who took them from the
files of the Department of Foreign Affairs." <span style="">(p. </span><span style="">52, </span>transcript)
<span class="GramE">The</span> foregoing testimony of the <span style="">witness does not prove the genuineness of the specimen signatures, more
so because the agent who allegedly took the detail orders from the files of the
Foreign Affairs Department was not presented as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NBI expert concluded, from his
observation that there are significant differences between the questioned
signature and the specimen signatures on the detail orders, that the former is
a forgery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the conclusion is
stultified by the admis­sion of the same witness that even between the specimen
signatures there are variations in the handwriting characteristics of the
signatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 24,
transcript.)</span> Our appreciation of <span style="">the
</span>evidence showed that there are variations indeed between </span><span style="">the specimen signatures </span><span style="">(Exhibits S-1 to S-5); there are distinct
similarities even bet­ween the questioned signature and the specimen signatures
(<span class="SpellE">cf</span> Q-5, S-4 and S-5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the evidence presented by the
Government, it cannot be said that the forgery of the questioned sig­nature has
been satisfactorily proven.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Even if the competent proofs were presented showing that the
questioned signature is a for­gery, the forgery of the signature on the cable
authorization would not have nullified the documentation of the petitioners by
the consulate in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were not cited to any specific rule or
regulation of the Depart­ment of Foreign Affairs stating that the prior
authorization of this Department is necessary before the consular official
abroad can act in documentation cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, as per resolution of the Cabinet of August 24, 1948,
the President suggested and the Cabinet "resolved to restore the prewar
practice of entrusting to our respective consular officials abroad the duty of
receiving all visa applications and investigating the qualifications of the
applicants." (<span class="GramE">cited</span> in <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>,
Immigration Laws, 1956 Ed., p. 142.) It is evident from the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
resolution that the Executive branch of the Government intended that the right
to screen applicants for entry into this country should be lodged in the
consular offi­cials abroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Giving
effect to this intention, the Supreme Court stated in Ng <span class="SpellE">Gioc</span>
Lin vs. The Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs G.R. No. L-2175,
March 31, 1950, "that although the foreign service has been placed under
the over-all direction and supervision of the Depart­ment of Foreign Affairs by
Executive Order No. 18 (42 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., 2064), this
does not necessarily mean that the Department Secretary takes the place of the
consular officers abroad in the matter of the issuance of passport visas, for
the Secretary cannot relieve those officers of their responsibility under the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> reason of the law in
conferring upon the consuls themselves the duty and power to grant passports
and visas is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicant for
visa is in a foreign country and the Philippine con­sular officer there is
naturally in a better position than the home office to determine through
investigation conducted on the spot whether or not the said applicant is
qualified to enter the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
It can be deduced from the foregoing that the documentation of the petitioners
in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> was not vitiated by a substantial defect
even assuming that it was done without prior authorization from the Foreign
Affairs Department.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It must be stated in this connection that the petitioners became
Philippine citizens because of their relation with their mother who is a
Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their status was conferred on
them neither by the documentation by the consulate in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
nor by the finding of the Board of Special Inquiry in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sequently, whatever defects there are in
the proceedings before the consulate and the board of inquiry cannot affect
their status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, even assuming
that the petitioners were not properly documented, there is no basis for the
finding of the respondent Board that they are aliens who can be excluded."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Due, therefore, to the
pronouncement made by the Court of Appeals regarding the insufficiency of the
evidence pre­sented </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">herein petitioners to prove the alleged
forgery - again, a matter not now within our power to review - the ques­tioned
cablegram must be deemed to be authentic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But be that as it may, we agree with both the Court of First Instance of
origin and the Court of Appeals that, even assuming that said document was
forged, this would not automatically render void all the proceedings had before
the Philippine Consulate in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and the Board of
Special inquiry, both of which ended with a definite finding that the <span class="SpellE">Callanos</span> were Filipino citizens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That these proceedings and finding can not be
nullified by the Department of Foreign Affairs summarily and without giving the
parties concerned an opportunity to be heard is too evident to require any
demonstration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To the other questions
relied upon by herein petitioners, the following portions of the decision of
the Court of Appeals would seem to be sufficient answer:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The question, whether petitioners who are admittedly Filipino
citizens at birth subsequently <u>acquired</u> Chinese citizenship under the
Chinese Law of Nationality by reason of recognition or a pro­longed stay in
China, is a fit subject for the Chinese law and the Chinese court to determine,
which cannot be resolved by a Philippine court without encroaching on the legal
system of China.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the settled rule
of international law, af­firmed by the Hague Convention on Conflict of
Nationality Laws of <st1:date year="1930" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1930</st1:date>
and by the International Court of Justice, is that "Any question as to
whether a person possesses the nationality of a particular state should be
determined <span style="">in </span>accordance with
the law of that state." (<span class="GramE">quoted</span> in <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, Private International Law, <span style="">1957 </span>Ed., p. 112.) There was no necessity of deciding that
question because so far as <span style="">concerns the
petitioners' status, the only question in this proceeding is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the </span>petitioners <u>lose</u> their
Philippine citizenship<span style=""> upon the
performance of certain acts or the happening of certain events in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
deciding this question no foreign law can be applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners are admittedly Filipino
citizens at birth, and their status must be governed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Philippine law wherever they may be, in conformity with Article 15
(formerly Article 9) of the Civil Code which provides as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Laws relating to family rights and
duties, or to the </span><u><span style="">status</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">conditions</span> and legal capacity of persons are binding upon
citizens of the Philippines, even though living abroad." Under Article IV,<span style=""> </span>Section 2, of the <span style="">Philippine Constitution, "Philippine
citizenship may be lost or reacquired in the manner provided by law.",
which implies that the question of whether a Filipino has lost his Philippine
citizenship shall </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">determined by no other than the Philippine
law.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 63, as amended by Republic Act No.
106, provides that a Filipino citizen may lose his citizenship by
naturalization in a foreign country; express renunciation of citizenship;
subscribing to an oath of allegiance to support the constitution or laws of a
foreign country; rendering service to, or accepting a commission in, the armed
forces of a foreign country; cancellation of the certificate of naturalization;
declaration by competent authority that he is a deserter of the Philippine
armed forces in time of war; in the case of a woman, by marriage to a foreigner<span style=""> if, by virtue of laws in force in her
husband's country, she acquires his nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Recog</u></span><u><span style="">nition of the petitioners by their alien father </span></u><u><span style="">is not among the grounds for losing
Philippine citizenship under Philippine <span class="GramE">law<span style="text-decoration: none;">,</span></span></span></u><span style=""> and it cannot be said that the petitioners
lost their former status by reason of such recognition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About the only mode of losing Philippine
citizenship which closely bears on the petitioners' case </span>is
renunciation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even renunciation
cannot be cited in support of the conclusion that petitioners lost their
Philippine citizenship because <u>the law requires an express renunciation</u>,
which means a renunciation that is made known distinctly and explicitly and not
left to inference or implication; a renunciation manifested by direct and
appropriate language, as distinguished from that which is inferred from
conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Opinion No.
69 of the Secre­tary of Justice, Series of 1940.)</span> Indeed, as the Supreme
Court held in U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Tianse</span>,
29 Phil. 332, a case for deportation, where <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, a
natural child of a Filipino mother and a Chinese father, born in the
Philippines, was brought by his parents to China when he was 4 years old, where
he remained for 18 or 19 years, returning to the Philippines at 25 years of
age, "The fact that a minor child in those conditions was taken to China
and remained there for several years is not suffi­cient ground upon which to
hold that he has changed his nationality, when, after reaching his majority, he
did not express his desire to choose the nationality of his father." The
import of the foregoing pronouncement is that of itself a protracted stay in a
foreign country does not amount to renunciation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>More</u><u><span style="">over, herein petitioners were all minors when they were brought to </span></u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="">China</span></u></st1:place></st1:country-region><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">in 1946</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were without legal capacity to renounce </span><span style="">their status.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">Upon their return to the
Philippines only <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> Go <span class="SpellE">Callano</span>
had attained the age of majority, but even as to him there could not have been</span><span style=""> renunciation </span>because he did not
manifest by direct and appropriate language that he was disclaiming Philippine
citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, after he
has attained the age of majority, he applied for registration as a Philippine
citizen and sought entry into this country, which are clear indicia of his
intent to continue his former status.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The foregoing shows that the petitioners have not lost their Philippine
citizenship."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Lastly, petitioners claim
that the private respondents are barred from questioning the decision of the
Board of Immigration Commissioners dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="8"><span style="">August 21, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the warrant of exclusion issued by the
Commissioner of Immigration on the same date, because they did not appeal from
either to the Secretary of Justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find this to be
without merit for the reason that, </span><span style="">as
stated </span><span style="">before, both orders were
issued without previous notice and hearing and were, therefore, in violation of

in the case of an <u>Alien</u>, </span>decisions of the Board of Immigration
Commissioners, like that of any other administrative body, do not constitute <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> so as to bar a
re-examination of the <u>alien's</u> right to enter or stay (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Se <span class="SpellE">Lun</span> et al., vs. Board of
Immigration, G.R. No. L-6017, <st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1954</st1:date>), and the courts can grant relief if said Board abused its
powers, or committed serious legal errors, or denied the <u><span style="">alien</span></u><span style=""> </span>a fair hearing (Lao Tang Bun vs. <span class="SpellE">Fabre</span><span style=""> </span>81 Phil.
