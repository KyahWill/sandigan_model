<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal from a resolution of the 
Social Security Commission ordering the respondent-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc., to pay sickness benefits 
to the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On 1 September 1957, the said 
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span>, then an employee of the appellant, 
became an employee-member of v the Social Security System. Within a short time 
thereafter, he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and was confined at the mines 
hospital of his employer in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> 
in October, 1957. Later on, he was transferred to <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, 
where he was still confined at the time he filed his petition for sickness 
benefits on 12 July 1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On 6 November 1958, the employer 
company separated <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> from its employ. It 
remitted to the System premium contributions corresponding to the month of 
September 1957 only, and refused <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot's</span> demand for 
sickness benefits up to his separation in November 1958. Because of such 
refusal, the said employee filed a petition with the Social Security Commission 
<span class="SpellE">impleading</span> as alternative respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc. <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> Rope Company, and the Social Security System. The 
Commission held <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> liable for <span class="SpellE">Jalotjotâ€™s</span> sickness benefits, and <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> resorted to the Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellant's first assignment 
of error contests the authority of the Commission in <span class="SpellE"><i>motu</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></i> 
ordering the appellant to remit to the System its 31/2 share in the premium 
contributions on account of <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot's</span> membership 
therein. Such order, according to the appellant, created a cause of <span class="GramE">action</span> between it and the System, despite the lack of any 
cross-claim by the System against the alternative respondent <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The foregoing position of the 
appellant is untenable, because the hearings before the Commission are 
administrative and are not strictly governed by the technical rules of procedure 
that are applied to judicial trials (<span class="SpellE">Oromega</span> Lumber 
Co. <i>vs</i>. SSC, L-14833, 28 April 1962); and since the Commission had 
discovered, in the case before it, that the appellant had not complied with its 
statutory duty of remitting to the System its share in the premium 
contributions, the Commission acted well within its authority in ordering the 
remittance since it has been vested with the direction and control of the System 
(Sec. 3, Social Security Act, as amended). At any rate, respondent has 
interposed its defense that it did not remit the premium due from <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> because the latter was not receiving any 
compensation after he became sick; and it is not shown that respondent could 
offer any other excuses if the System had filed a cross-claim against it. Hence, 
it was in no way prejudiced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In its second assignment of 
error, the appellant holds that the claimant-employee is not entitled to 
sickness benefits because at the time of his confinement he has not been a 
member of the System for at least one (1) and that he has not paid premiums for 
at least six months, conformably with the rules and regulations of the 
Commission and Section 14 of the Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This argument has no 
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From 1 September 1957, until his 
employment terminated in early November 1958, <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> 
was a member of the System. His membership was not ended by his sickness. Hence, 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Iron Mines Agents, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> was responsible for remitting the employee's share of the 
premiums throughout that period of more than one year (Social Security Act, sec. 
22). The proffered excuse that appellant-employer had no obligation to remit the 
premium contributions because the employee earned no compensation is not 
entirely true; for the employee was entitled to receive, and was concededly 
paid, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and his contribution could have been 
deducted from such payments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">However, even without the 
compensation payments, the appellant's argument must be rejected in view of our 
rulings in the analogous cases of Franklin Baker Company of the Philippines vs. 
Social Security System, L-17361, 29 April 1963, and the cases cited therein, the 
<i>rationale</i> being that as long as the employment is not terminated the 
payment of contributions by the employer is compulsory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * *<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span class="GramE">payment</span> 
of contributions by an employer is compulsory during its coverage, and in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of the Social Security Act, coverage 
is determined solely by the Existence of an employer-employee relationship. 
While an employee is on leave, even without pay, he is still an employee of his 
employer, their contract of employment has not yet terminated. So much so that 
the employee may still return to work and the employer is still bound to accept 
him. His responsibility as an employee still exists. He is still entitled to the 
benefits of the System when he returns. Consequently, his employer is still 
liable to pay his contributions to the Commission on account of its employee who 
is on leave without pay."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And in the same case, this Court 
specifically ruled that <i>"the time when an employee may not be actually 
receiving compensation, as when he is on sick leave without pay, 18 not 
excepted"</i> (Franklin Baker Co. vs. SSS, supra.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The last assignment of error 
disputes the authority of Commission to order the deduction from the employee's 
sickness benefits of his 21/2% share in the premium. The premises laid by the 
appellant in this assignment of error are the same as those which it stated in 
the second assignment of error. Perforce, this assignment must similarly 
fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF THE 
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the
