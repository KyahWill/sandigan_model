				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the face of a statutory norm, which, as interpreted in a
uniform Line of decisions by this Court, speaks unequivo­cally and is free from
doubt, the lower court with full recognition that the case for the plaintiff
creditor, Philippine National Bank, "is meritorious strictly from the
legal standpoint"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

dismissed nine (9) cases filed by it, seeking "to recover from the
defendant lumber producers [<span class="SpellE">Bitulok</span> Sawmill, Inc.; <span class="SpellE">Dingalan</span> Lumber Co., Inc.; Sierra Madre Lumber Co., Inc.; <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span> Lumber Co., Inc.; Woodworks, Inc.; Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span>; Tomas B. <span class="SpellE">Morato</span>; Findlay

In essence then, the crucial question posed by this appeal from such a decision
of the lower court is adherence to the rule of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, would non-compliance with a
plain statutory command, considering the persuasiveness of the plea that
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> would "not have subscribed
to [the] capital stock" of the Philippine Lumber Distributing Agency
"were it not for the assurance of the [then] Presi­dent of the Republic of
the Philippines that the Government would back [it] up by investing P9.00 for
every peso"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
subscribed, a condition which was not fulfilled, such commitment not having
been complied with, be justified?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
answer must be in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be otherwise even if an element of unfairness and
injustice could be predicated, as the lower court, in a rather sympathetic
mood, did find in the plaintiff bank as creditor, compelling defendant lumber
producers under the above circumstances to pay the balance of their
subscriptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a plain and statutory
command, if applicable, must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule of law cannot be satisfied with anything Less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In these various suits decided jointly, the Philippine National
Bank, as creditor, and therefore the real party in interest, was allowed by the
lower court to substitute the receiver of the Philippine Lumber Distributing
Agency in these respective actions for the recovery from defendant lumber
producers the balance of their stock subscriptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount sought to be collected from defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Bitulok</span> Sawmill, Inc., <span class="SpellE">Dingalan</span> Lumber Co., Inc., and Sierra Madre Lumber Co.,

<p class="BODY">The Philippine Lumber Distributing Agency, Inc.<span class="GramE">,
accord­ing</span> to the lower court, "was organized sometime in the early
part of 1947 upon the initiative and insistence of the late President Manuel <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
who for the purpose, had called several conferences between him and the
subscribers and organizers of the Philippine Lumber Distributing Agency,
Inc."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The purpose was praiseworthy, to insure a steady supply of lumber, which could
be sold at reasonable prices to enable the war sufferers to rehabilitate their
devastated homes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He con­vinced the lumber producers to
form a lumber cooperative and to pool their resources together in order to
wrest, parti­cularly, the retail trade from aliens who were acting as middle
men in the distribution of lumber.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the beginning, the lumber producers were reluctant to organize the cooperative
agency as they believed that it would not be easy to eliminate from the retail
trade the alien middlemen who had been in this business from time immemorial,
but because the late President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> made it clear
that such a cooperative agency would not be successful without a substantial
working capital which the lumber producers could not entirely shoulder, and as
an induce­ment he promised and agreed to finance the agency by making the
Government invest P9.00 by way of counterpart for every peso that the members
would invest therein, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This was the assurance relied upon according to the decision,
which stated that the amount thus contributed by such lumber producers was not
enough for the operation of its business especially having in mind the primary
purpose of putting an end to alien domination in the retail trade of lumber
products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there any
appropriation by the legislature of the counterpart fund to be put up by the
Government, namely, P9.00 for every peso invested by defendant lumber
producers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, “the Late
President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> in­structed the Hon. Emilio <span class="SpellE">Abello</span>, then Executive Secretary and Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Philippine National Bank, for the latter to grant said
agency an overdraft in the original sum of P250,000.00 which was later
increased to P350,000.00, which was approved by said Board of Directors of the
Philippine National Bank on July 28, 1947, payable on or before April 30, 1958,
with interest at the rate of 6% per annum, and secured by the chattel mortgages
on the stock of lumber of said agency."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The Philippine Government did not invest the P9.00 for every peso coming from
defendant lumber producers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loan
extended to the Philippine Lumber Distributing Agency by the Philippine
National Bank was not paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence these suits.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the lower courts the above facts sufficed for their
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To its mind it is grossly
unfair and unjust for the plaintiff bank now to compel the lumber producers to
pay the balance of their subscriptions* * *. Indeed, when the late President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> made representations to the plaintiff bank, thru the
Hon. Emilio <span class="SpellE">Abello</span> who was then the Executive
Secretary and Chairman of its Board of Directors, to grant said over­draft to
the agency, it was the only way by which President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
could make good his commitment that the Government would invest in said agency
to the extent already mentioned because, according to said late President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, the legislature had not appropriated any amount for
such Counter­part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, viewing
from all considerations of equity in the case, the Court finds that plaintiff
bank should not collect any more from the defendants the balance of their
subscriptions to the capital stock of the Philippine Lumber Distributing
Agency, Inc."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even with the case for defendant lumber producers being put forth
in its strongest possible light in the appealed decision, the plaintiff
creditor, the Philippine National Bank, should have been the prevailing party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the law as it stands, the judgment reached
by the lower court cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appeal as earlier made <span class="GramE">clear,</span> possesses
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Philippine Trust Co. v. Rivera,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
citing the lead­ing case of Velasco v. <span class="SpellE">Poizat</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court: held: "It is established doctrine that subscriptions to the
capital of a corporation constitute a fund to which creditors have a right to
look for satisfaction of their claims and that the assignee in insolvency can
maintain an action upon any unpaid stock subscription in order to realize
assets for the payment of its debts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* *
* A corporation has no power to release an original subscriber to its capital
stock from the obligation of paying for his shares, without a valuable consideration
for such release; and as against creditors a reduction of the capital stock can
take place only in the manner and under the conditions prescribed by the
statute or the charter or the articles of incorporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, strict compliance with the statutory
regulations is necessary * * *" The <span class="SpellE">Poizat</span>
doctrine found acceptance in later cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
One of the latest cases, <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span> Gulf Electric Power
v. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
speaks to this effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the case
of Velasco v. <span class="SpellE">Poizat</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the corporation involved was insolvent, in which case all unpaid stock subscriptions
become payable on demand and are immediately recoverable in an action
instituted by the assignee."</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be unwarranted to ascribe to the late President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> the view that the payment of the stock subscriptions,
as thus required by Law, could be condoned in the event that the counter part
fund to be invested by the Government would not be available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if such were the case, however, and such
a promise were in fact made, to further the Laudable purpose to which the
proposed corporation would be devoted and the possibility that the lumber
producers would lose money in the process, still the plain and specific wording
of the applicable legal prevision as interpreted by this Court must be
controlling. It is a well settled principle that with all the vast powers
lodged in the Executive, he is still devoid of the prerogative of suspending
the operations of any statute or any of its terms.</p>

<p class="BODY">The emphatic and categorical language of an American decision
cited by the late Justice Laurel, In People v. Vera,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
comes to mind:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘”By the twentieth
article of the declaration of rights in the constitution of commonwealth, it is
declared that the power of suspending the laws, or the execution of the Laws,
ought never to be exercised but by the legislature, or by authority derived
from it, to be exercised in such particular cases only as the Legislature shall
expressly provide for.’" Nor could it be other­wise considering that the
Constitution specifically enjoins the President to see to it that all Laws be
faithfully executed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
There may be a discretion as to what a particular legal provision requires;
there can be none whatsoever as to the enforcement and application thereof once
<span class="GramE">its</span> meaning has been ascertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it decrees must be followed; what it
commands must be obeyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
respected, the wishes of the President, to the contrary notwithstanding, even
if impelled by the most worthy of motives and the most persuasive equitable
considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, such is not
the case here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For at no time did President
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> ever give defendant lumber producers to
understand that the failure of the Govern­ment for any reason to put up the
counterpart fund could terminate their statutory liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such is not the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the lower court was of a different mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mat is not to pay homage to the rule of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its decision then, one it is to be
repeated influenced by what it considered to be the “equity of the case”, is
not legally impeccable.</p>
