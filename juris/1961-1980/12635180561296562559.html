				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for a review of a decision of respondent Court
of Appeals dated October 31, 1964, setting aside in a <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding an order of the Court of Juvenile &amp; Domestic Relations of
Manila, thus precluding the guardian designated therein, <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarte</span>, petitioner
before us, from assuming her functions as such during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of an appeal against her appointment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issue raised is therefore whether in attaching to such an order the
quality of immediate enforceability, there was a grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court answered in the affirmative.
We are of a different mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the facts
as found by it, which we are not a liberty to change, and in the light of an
applicable doctrine, it would follow that such appointment as guardian being
given effect forthwith is not offensive to what the law requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find for petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts as set forth in the appealed decision
follow:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"From the record of this
case we gather that on November 3, 1961, respondent <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zafra-Sarte</span> petitioned the Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Court for the appointment of a legal guardian over the person and
property of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span> <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>,
whom said respondent herein alleged to be an incompetent person, afflicted with
mental disorder and other ailments which rendered her incapable to take care of
herself and to manage her property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
her verified petition, <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span> prayed for her
appointment as the legal guardian of the person and property of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span>, claiming that she is a niece of the latter, being
a daughter of her (<span class="SpellE">Remigia's</span>) sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said petition was however opposed by Julian <span class="SpellE">Lua</span>, who claimed that he and <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> have lived together as common-law husband and
wife for more than 30 years, and by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span>,
who claimed that he is a half-brother of the alleged incompetent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
prayed that either of them be appointed legal guardian of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span>,
should she be found incompetent."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What happened next was narrated thus in such decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At the conclusion of the trial, which
forthwith followed after the issues had been joined, respondent Judge found <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span> to be really mentally deranged and for this reason
appointed <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span> as legal guardian of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> person and property in an order dated April 8,
1964 * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this order was
served on the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, who are now herein
petitioners, on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 22, 1964, Julian <span class="SpellE">Lua</span>
and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span> submitted their motion for
reconsideration of that order of the respondent Judge, but on the same date,
while such motion was still unresolved and before the period for appeal had
expired, said respondent directed the issuance of the corresponding letters of
guardianship, and as a matter of fact such letters were issued, after <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span> had submitted the required bond of P1, 000.00
and had taken her oath of office as legal guardian of the person and property
of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span> <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="5">May
 2, 1964</st1:date>, herein petitioners were notified of the order of
respondent Judge dated <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1964</st1:date>,
denying their action for reconsideration as <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
in the guardianship proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
then filed their notice of appeal and deposited their appeal bond of P120.00 in
cash, and on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1964</st1:date>,
they also filed their Record on Appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1964</st1:date>,
respondent Judge approved the record on appeal of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
in that proceeding and directed the Clerk to elevate that case to this Court
for review."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="4">April 27,
 1964</st1:date>, before such motion for reconsideration was resolved,
petitioner filed an urgent motion to enable her as such guardian to bring the
ward to the hospital before the Court of Juvenile &amp; Domestic
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the
decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On May 15, 1964,
respondent Judge favorably acted upon this motion, the opposition thereto of
herein petitioners notwithstanding, and ordered them to transfer and surrender
the person of the incompetent to <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Zafra-Sarte</span> * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, this last order of respondent Judge was issued after the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in that guardianship proceeding had filed their
notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 19, 1964, herein petitioners filed a
motion for reconsideration of said order of the court dated May 15, 1964,
praying that the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> as to the custody of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span> <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>, who is under the
charge of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span>, be
maintained during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of their appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for reconsideration was denied by
respondent Judge on <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1964</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the allegation that now respondents Julian <span class="SpellE">Lua</span>,
the common-law husband and her half-brother, respondent Francisco <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span> as well as her half-sister, respondent <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span>, had no other
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to prevent the
immediate execution of the order by the Court of Juvenile &amp; Domestic
Relations, a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> was filed by them with
respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were,
able to obtain a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the enforcement of
the aforesaid order complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
noted in the brief for petitioner:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Upon the facts above-stated, the Court of Appeals annulled and set
aside the order issued by the trial court on May 15, 1964, in Special
Proceeding No. 03773, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued on July 14,
1964 was ordered stayed until such time the Court of Appeals shall have the
opportunity to review the merits of the aforesaid order appointing <span class="SpellE">Exaltacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Zafra-Sarte</span> (herein
petitioner) as legal guardian of the person and property of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a motion for the reconsideration of the above decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1964</st1:date> was denied, the
present petition for review was filed before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted at the outset, we reverse respondent
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner would impress on us that the issue as to the power of
respondent Court to suspend the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of an order
appointing a guardian in the event of an appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
was decided in <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Wislizenus</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
To maintain such an assertion, she quoted an excerpt from our opinion in that
case thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The order declaring the
<span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> and appointing a guardian was good,
until reversed or set aside; and authorized the guardian, in spite of the
appeal, to do whatever was necessary under the direction of the Court, to
protect the property of the incompetent." The above citation does impart
more than a semblance of plausibility to her contention it does support her
stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that the excerpt on which petitioner would
pin her hopes resulted from the realization of this Court that if it were not
thus there was the fear, not without basis, that the property of the person
adjudged incompetent could be frittered away during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of such appeal or converted to the use of designing persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above consideration does not detract from
the general principle announced that such appointment of a guardian should be
considered good until reversed or set aside on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such weighty and persuasive reason that
would call for a different ruling may be discussed from the facts as found by
the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above
statement from the opinion of Justice Moreland is thus impressed with a force
sufficient to give more than legal color to what was ordered by the Court of
Juvenile and Domestic Relations of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For it to yield deference to such a pronouncement by this Court cannot
certainly earn the stigma of a grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Why did respondent Court view the matter otherwise?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It relied on two <st1:state><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:state>
decisions, one promulgated in 1911, Coburn v. Hynes<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and another in 1917 O'Donnell v. Sixth Judicial District.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
They speak to the effect that upon the filing of an appeal, the guardian
appointed was automatically precluded from exercising her functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly noted in the brief for
petitioner the holding of each of the above cases to that effect is predicated
on relevant statutory provisions of the State of <st1:state><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, such a doctrine goes
back to an 1892 pronouncement of the California Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Court should have displayed less receptivity to the persuasive force
of the above doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might have
been otherwise if there were no <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is, respondent Court was not justified
in setting aside the order sought to be assailed in a <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding made in reliance on a decision of this court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1964</st1:date> is reversed with
costs against private respondents.</p>
