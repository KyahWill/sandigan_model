dismissing the petition for mandamus therein filed against Honorable <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Honorio</span></span><span class="GramE"> Romero,
as Judge of the Court of <span style="">First </span>Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and the Philippine National Bank.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1949" day="4" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 4, 1949</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
Paula Sanchez <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> de <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
executed a general power of attorney in favor of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
one of her children, authorizing him, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
"to borrow money x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
with or without security, upon such terms and conditions as he x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> may approve x <span class="SpellE">x</span>”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Purporting to
act in pursuance of this authority, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
obtained, from the Bank, from 1952 to 1956, several crop-loans for which he
executed the corresponding promissory notes, to guarantee the payment of which
he constituted chattel mortgages on <span style="">standing
</span>crops and real estate mortgages on several parcels of land, one of which
is covered by TCT No. 2727, in the name of his aforementioned mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter died intestate, on May 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was survived by nine (9) children,
namely, peti­tioners herein - <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, Ernesto, <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Re<span style="">surreccion</span></span><span style="">, Ricardo, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
and Tomas, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> -- and said Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1964</st1:date>,
the Bank instituted Special Proceedings No. 1783 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> for the appointment of an administrator
of her intestate estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the Bank's
recommendation, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Concha</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span>,
Deputy Clerk of Branch II of<span style=""> </span>said
Court, was appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of said es­tate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, the Bank commenced Civil
Case No. 2715 of the same court, against Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
his wife, <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> Zamora and said <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> - hereinafter referred to collectively as
the defendants - to recover the amount of the aforementioned promissory notes
and to foreclose the mortgages guaranteeing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Before summons could be
served, or on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 22, 1965</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, the Bank
amended its complaint.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants took, however, no step whatsoever to resist this
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having heard about it,
petitioners herein, accordingly, asked the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>,
on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1965</st1:date>, to either
file her ans­wer to the complaint in said case, or allow their counsel to repre­sent
her therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
replied that she would first consult the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three (3) days later, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="7">July
 3, 1965</st1:date>, the Bank moved to declare the defendants in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1965</st1:date>, petitioners herein filed a motion praying
that they be al­lowed to intervene by filing an answer in intervention which
was filed on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
day, <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1965</st1:date>, the
defendants were declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1965</st1:date>, the court, presided
over by Honorable <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> Romero, Judge, denied said
motion to intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration filed by petitioners herein had, on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1965</st1:date>, the same fate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals their
present petition for certiorari and mandamus with preliminary injunction,
against Judge Romero and the Bank, to annul the orders of respondent Judge,
dated August 11 and November 12, 1965, to compel him to allow petitioners'
intervention in said Case No. 2715, as well as to admit petitioners' answer in
intervention therein, and to restrain respondents herein from proceeding with
and/or trying said case, until this action shall have been finally
decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon later, the Court of
Appeals issued the writ of preliminary injunction sought by the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, thereafter,
the Court of Appeals rendered its appealed decision dismissing said petition
and dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for
review on certiorari.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed decision is based upon the theory that "the
granting or refusal of a motion to intervene is a matter of judicial
discretion" and that, "once exercised" the action of the court
"can­not be reviewed or controlled by mandamus, however erroneous it may
be".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>-Luna v. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
from which this statement was taken, adds, however, that "the only
exception" to said rule "is when there is an arbitrary abuse of that
discretion, <u>in which case mandamus may issue</u> if there is no other
adequate remedy, <u>though the result is that the court will be called upon to
review the exercise of a discretionary power</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It so happened that no such abuse of power had been committed in said case,
which involved an attempt by <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>-Luna, Inc., as
owners of the <span class="SpellE">Cristal</span> Arcade building to intervene in
an action, filed by the <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino, as
administrator of said building, to eject <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
Andres Luna - the very president of <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>-Luna, Inc.
- for non-payment of rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order
of the Court of First Instance, dismissing the action for mandamus against the
munici­pal judge who refused to allow the intervention, was affirmed because
"the sole question presented" in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case "was one of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question of ownership of the building was a matter <u>foreign</u>." Such
is not the situation obtaining in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, in the case of Otto <span class="SpellE">Gmur</span>,
Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> -
likewise cited by the Court of Appeals in support of its stand - the Supreme
Court <u>issued</u> the writ of mandamus <u>direct­ing</u> the lower court <u>to
permit</u> the petitioners to intervene in the main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ was similarly <u>granted</u> in <span class="SpellE">Zaide</span> v. <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, rather recently, this Court, speaking
through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> said, in <span class="SpellE">Balane</span> v. de Guzman<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that mandamus cannot be resorted to in order to
control <span class="GramE">discretion,</span> and that as a gene­ral rule
allowance of a motion to intervene rests in the sound discretion of the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such discre­tion is not
unlimited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise thereof, the
Rules provide that the Court 'shall consider whether or not the intervention
will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original
parties and whether or not the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> rights
may be fully protected in a separate proceeding.' If these considerations weigh
in favor of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, <u>a denial of the
intervention may amount to an arbitrary or capricious exercise of discretion
which is correct­ible by mandamus</u>, if an ordinary appeal would not be an
adequate and speedy remedy."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the facts obtaining in the case at bar, we are of the
considered opinion that respondent Judge had abused his discretion gravely in
denying petitioners’ motion to intervene, for:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident that the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> was not inclined to contest the foreclosure
suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not answer the complaint
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, when petitioners
urged her to resist the action of the bank or to allow their counsel to do so
for her, the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> replied that <u>she would
first consult the bank, the very party she was supposed to fight</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, seemingly, she did consult the bank for,
three (3) days <span class="GramE">later,</span> it moved to declare her and her
co-defendants in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, it should be noted that <u>she owed her appointment as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> to the bank</u>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style=""> </span>Petitioners’ motion to
intervene was filed <u>before</u> the defendants had been declared in default
and, hence, before the is­sues had been joined. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In other words, the intervention would not
have caused undue delay in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer in
intervention attached to petitioners' motion to intervene set up defenses which
had a reasonable semblance of validity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For instance, petitioners assailed the validity of the mortgages
constituted by Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, insofar as the real
properties of their mother were concerned, upon the ground that his authority
was contained in a <u>general</u> power of attorney, whereas Article 1878 of
the Civil Code of the Philippines requires a <u>special</u> power of attorney
"to create or convey real rights over immovable property".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that said general power of
attorney was given on <st1:date year="1949" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1949</st1:date>,
or prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but it is, likewise, undisputed that the aforementioned mortgages were
constituted from 1952 to 1956, when said Code was already in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, again, petitioners set up the defense
of prescription of action, inasmuch as Civil Case No. 2715 was com­menced in
1965, or more than ten (10) years after the execution of some of the promissory
notes and mortgages involved in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents maintain
that petitioners herein have no actual, material, direct and immediate right or
interest to entitle them to intervene in the principal action, their interest
therein being allegedly inchoate or in expectancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is <span style="">manifestly devoid of merit for <span class="SpellE">successional</span>
rights are "transmit­ted from the moment of the death of the
decedent"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">and it is conceded that petitioners herein
are children of the deceased and her forced heirs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, an appeal from the decision that may be rendered
in the main case would not be a speedy and adequate remedy for petitioners
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it would unduly
delay the termination of said case, for it would require a remand thereof to
the lower court for retrial, with the possibility of ano­ther appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby reversed and another one shall be entered directing respondent Judge to
grant petitioners' motion to intervene in said Civil Case No. 2715, to admit
their aforementioned answer in intervention, and to otherwise allow them to
participate in the proceedings in said case as <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
therein, with costs against the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Writ granted.</p>
