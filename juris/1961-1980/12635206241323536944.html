				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant Chiu <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Ye
interposes this appeal (p. 88, rec.) from the orders dated March 25, 1963 and
August 22, 1963 (pp. 75-81, rec.) dismissing his petition for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1954</st1:date>,
petitioner-appellant Chiu <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Ye filed his petition
for naturalization before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A, pp. 2-3, rec.),
which petition was published only once in the Official Gazette issue of August,
1954 and once a week for three consecutive weeks in the Vanguard, a newspaper
of general circulation in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Dumaguete</span></span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE"> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> E, E-1, E-2, E-3, F, F-1, and F-2), as well as
posted on the bulletin board of the court (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition does not allege that he is of good moral
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it state that he
resided in the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Zamboanguita</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, during the Japanese occupation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial, the court
rendered a decision dated </span><st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="11"><span style="">November 17, 1958</span></st1:date><span style=""> granting his petition (pp. 45-52, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1959</st1:date>,
petitioner-appellant filed a motion ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> to
withdraw his exhibits consisting of his immigrant certificate of residence (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. C and B), <span style="">identi­</span>fication
cards (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. G-3 and Y-2), check-up certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">G-4) and alien certificates of
registrations (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> O, O-1 to O-8), on the
ground that he needed them for his pro­jected trip around the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was granted by the court on the
same day; and immediately thereafter on that same day, January 27, 1959,
petitioner-appellant withdrew the aforementioned exhibits after signing a
receipt <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> at the bottom of his motion just
below the curt court order grant­ing the same (pp. 53-54, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">He did not file any declaration of intention, because he claims
that he is exempted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by reason of the fact
that he has resided in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
continuously for over thirty years since his arrival in May, 1916 at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename></st1:place> City from <st1:place><st1:city>Amoy</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place>, where he was born
on <st1:date year="1904" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1904</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did not allege this in his petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated January 22, 1963, the court, after due
hearing and finding that petitioner-appellant had complied with the
requirements of R. A. No. 530, authorized petitioner-appellant to take his oath
of allegiance and directed the issuance of a certificate of naturalization in
his favor (pp. 59-60, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 22, 1963, the Solicitor General thru the City
Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City filed a motion to vacate
the decisions of November 17, 1958 and of January 22, 1963, re­spectively
granting his petition for naturalization and allowing him to take oath of
citizenship, on the ground that the petition is fatally defective and void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span> because
petitioner-appel­lant did not file any declaration of intention from which he
is not exempt; and that the petitioner does not have a lucrative trade
considering that he has a wife and four children to support in 1963 and eight
children to support at the time he filed his petition in 1954 (pp. 61-63,
rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner-appellant filed an opposition to the said motion
to vacate, to which the government filed a reply (pp. 64-­74, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1963</st1:date>, the trial court set aside the decisions of <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1958</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1963</st1:date> and dismissed the
petition (p. 75, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioner-appellant filed a motion to introduce further evidence and for the
reconsideration of the order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1963</st1:date> (pp. 76-77, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8,
 1963</st1:date>, the trial court allowed defendant to adduce additional
evidence, which however the court found to be insufficient to support his
petition, for which reason the court in an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1963</st1:date> accordingly denied appellant's
motion to set aside the order of <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1963</st1:date> (p. 81, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
this appeal.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly held that failure on the part of the petitioner
to aver in his petition that he is of good moral cha­racter is fatal; because
strict compliance with the requirements of the law is jurisdictional.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">His two character witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Crescenciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ozoa</span> and Buenaventura Zamora could not attest to his
conduct during the period of Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, for they
did not see him as he evacuated to <span class="SpellE">Zamboanguita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as contended by the Solicitor General, his income of P1<span class="GramE">,800.00</span> per annum from 1954 to 1960 with a wife, five
children and a Chinese mother-in-law to support, or his yearly income of P4,200
since 1961 with a wife, four <span style="">minor
children and a 76-year old (in 1961) mother-in-law </span>to <span style="">support is too inadequate to qualify him for
naturalization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted also that in his 1961 tax census form (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K), he stated that the members of his family consisted
of his wife, a 76-year old mother-in-law and seven children, two of whom were
already of age then and each earned P40.00 and P60.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the combined income of the two
children amounting to P100.00 a month were to be considered in favor of the
petitioner, still a monthly income of P450.00 would be insufficient to maintain
a family of ten in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">His claim that he is paid by his son-in-law <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dy</span>, a naturalized citizen and husband of his eldest
daughter <span class="SpellE">Nati­vidad</span>, a monthly salary of P80.00 since
January, 1963 as overseer of <span class="SpellE">Zosimo's</span> coconut
plantation in <span class="SpellE">Ayungon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental, is incredible; because <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> could more
efficiently oversee his alleged coconut plantation as he resides in <span class="SpellE">Ayungon</span> than the petitioner who was already 59 years old in
1963 with still seven members of his family to take care of and who resides in <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City over fifty kilometers from <span class="SpellE">Ayungon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even
conceding that he earns since 1963 a total of P5<span class="GramE">,160.00</span>
a year, still said income is insufficient to adequately maintain his family in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An annual income of P8<span class="GramE">,867.24</span>
in 1961 was not considered lucrative for an applicant with a wife and five children
to support, even if it increases every year.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, petitioner did not state, in his petition that he
resided during the period of three years of Japanese occupation in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanguita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, to
enable the government to inquire into his conduct during that period in the
community where he was then living.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, too, vitiates his petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant, who claims exemption from filing a
declaration of intention, omitted to allege such exemption and the reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in his petition, which failure is also fatal <span style="">to his petition and renders the same void.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> An amended </span><span style="">petition supplying such a deficiency should be treated as a new one and
published in accordance with Sec. 9 of the Revised Naturalization Law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner-appellant failed to attach in his petition a
certificate of arrival as required by Sec. 7 of Com. Act No. 473, as amended,
which omission likewise nullifies his petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for the requirement that the certificate of arrival should
form part of the petition is to prevent aliens, who illegally entered the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
from acquiring citizenship by naturalization.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
If, as he pretends, his certificate was taken back by the Bureau of Immigration
and in lieu thereof he was issued an immigrant's certificate of residence, he
could have submitted the same or a certified true copy thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders of <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1963</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="8">August
