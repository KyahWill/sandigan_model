				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On January 15, 1970, this Office received a 3rd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Department of Justice, dated December
18, 1969, forwarding a letter-complaint of <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Espinas</span>, dated June 1, 1969, preferring
administrative charges against Honorable Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span>,
District Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>,
as well as the latter's 2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, dated
September 30, 1969, by way of answer to said complaint, and complainant's letter-rejoinder
thereto, of November 15, 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon
thereafter, or by resolution of this Court dated January 26, 1970, the matter
was referred to Justice Jose N. Mendoza of the Court of Appeals for
investigation, report and recommendation, which was incorporated in a
"resolution" dated July 23, 1970, and filed with the Supreme Court on
August 5, 1970, recommending that the charges preferred against respondent
Judge be dismissed for failure to prosecute on the part of the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that when the case was called for hearing before Justice
Mendoza, on <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1970</st1:date>,
only Judge <span class="SpellE">Quicho</span> appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Justice Mendoza resolved to
postpone the hearing to June 8,1970, at 9:30 a.m., with the warning that,
should the complainant still not show up on the latter date, no further
postponement would be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
notwithstanding, complainant failed once more to appear at the scheduled
hearing, on <st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1970</st1:date>,
without giving<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span>any explanation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
waiting for him, in vain, up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10<span style="font-size: 9pt;">:</span>00 a.m.</st1:time> the investigator concluded
that complainant had lost interest in prosecuting the case, and, accordingly,
recommended its dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic letter-complaint of <st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1969</st1:date>, appears to have been written by one of the
parties in Land Registration Case No. N-352 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, entitled "Felipe Y. Gutierrez, Applicant, <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> <span class="SpellE">Espinas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span>," which was allegedly submitted for decision
on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1966</st1:date>, and
decided adversely to <span class="SpellE">Espinas</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter avers that he believes he lost
that case by reason of the fact that he had not complied "with a request
of said Judge"; that it took respondent Judge much more than the 90 days
permitted by the regulations to decide the case; and that, notwithstanding his
"pending cases undecided or untouched even after the expiration of 90
days, he received his pay, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> ."</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant, likewise, alleges that there are
"common rumors" to the effect that respondent Judge fraternizes with
lawyers who have cases pending in his court and even goes with them to
"nightspots" and that these lawyers have been favored in respondent's
decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his 2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1969</st1:date>, respondent states
that the delay in disposing of said Land Registration Case No. N-352 was due to
the inadequacy of his clerical staff and the lack of legal aid, despite representations
made by him in 1966, 1967 an 1968; that he had no branch clerk of court for
almost two years, his<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> </span>former deputy clerk
of court having been promoted clerk of court and none of his remaining
personnel being a lawyer who could be designated as acting branch clerk of
court until 1968; that, up to the present, respondent has no legal researcher;
and that it was only during the year 1969 that the positions of two docket
clerks, in the branch presided over by him, had been filled up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, likewise, denied, as false and
mischievous, the charge that he fraternizes with lawyers who have cases pending
in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>; that he has favored them in his
decisions; and that complainant had lost Case No. <span class="GramE">N-352 owing
to his failure to comply with a request allegedly made by respondent.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the present charges have been filed almost three
years after the rendition of the decision complained of; that complainant has
not introduced any evidence in support of his allegations of fact concerning
respondent's behavior and his alleged improper motive in rendering against him
the decision in Land Registration Case No. N-352 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>; and that the matter of collection of
respondent's emoluments notwithstanding the existence of several cases pending
decision for over 90 days is the subject matter of Administrative Case No.
138-J against respondent herein, the Court believes that the charges of
complainant herein should be, as they are hereby, dismissed, without prejudice
in such<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span>action is may be taken in said
Administrative Case No. 138-J, as regards the collection of respondent's
emoluments, despite said cases pending decision for over 90 days.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
