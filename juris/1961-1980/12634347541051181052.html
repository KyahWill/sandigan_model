claim, allegedly for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
certified duplicate copy of the said Decision is hereto attached as Annex 'C'
and 'C-1' and also made integral part of this petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The undersigned counsel received a copy of the
defunct Commissioner's Decision only last March 4, 1976, and within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to interpose appeal and/or petition for
review before the Honorable Court, undersigned counsel dispatched his
representatives to the Offices of the then Workmen's Compensation Commission to
ascertain and verify the correct status of the case only to be informed and
advised to wait until June or July, 1976 when all the records of the WCC would
then be transferred to the Office of the Secretary of Labor and thus to make
their follow up with the said Office.</blockquote>

some other days.</blockquote>

be found and undersigned's <span class="GramE">counsel were</span> advised to

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The foregoing explanation of petitioner
is reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact that upon
the abolition of the Workmen's Compensation Commission, there was a period when
it was difficult to obtain copies of the records because of the transfer of the
same to the office of the then Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner acted as soon as he obtained
the records necessary to support his petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In as much as the claim of the petitioner is
manifestly meritorious, there is basis for the exercise of the inherent
authority of this Court to suspend the rules and to exempt this case from said
rules.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the respondents that the claimant cannot
recover any compensation because when he filed the claim he had retired from
the Bureau of Public Schools <span style="">has no
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has previously held
that a claim can be filed within ten (10) years from the date that the
disability started.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not disputed that
the ailments of the petitioner supervened during his employment with the
respondent Bureau of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, there is a disputable presumption that the claim is compensable.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The claimant is relieved of the duty to
prove causation as it is legally presumed that the illness arose out of the
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof is
shifted to the employer to show that the ailment is not compensable.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, the petitioner presented the
physician's report "Exhibit C", showing that his illnesses were
caused by his employment with the Bureau of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Bureau of Public Schools, not
only failed to adduce evidence to show that the ailment of the petitioner was
neither caused nor aggravated by his employment as public school teacher but
failed to controvert the claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Acting Referee
correctly computed the compensation of the petitioner as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under Section 14 of the Act, the claimant is entitled to P3<span class="GramE">,538.80</span> as compensation computed at 60% of his average
weekly wage for 104 weeks."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

hospitalization and medical expenses upon presentation of proper receipts.</p>
