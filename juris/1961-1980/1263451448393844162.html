				<H3>FORTUNATO MAGTAOS, JR., ARTURO FABIAN, JOSE CARLOS,
PANTALEON VALENZUELA, CARLOS MARCELO, AND BENJAMIN AUSTRIA, PETITIONERS,
VS. HON. CECILIA MUÃ‘OZ PALMA, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, FRANCISCO P. FELIX, FELIX DE LA PAZ, ANGEL ALCORIZA,

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Upon consideration of the petition for <i>mandamus</i> with
preliminary mandatory injunction, and the return thereto of respondents, and
the case having been submitted, after oral arguments, for judgment; and it
appearing upon the averments of the verified petition before this Court (1)
that attempts to personally serve copies of the petitions for exclusion upon
respondents in Election Cases Nos. 39 to 55 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> proved futile as they could not be found or were not
known in their given addresses; and (2) that service by registered mail could
not be effected as respondents therein are fictitious or are non-residents of
the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Cainta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>;
(3) appearing further that the demands of due process have been satisfied as to
the respondents listed in said petitions below, the exclusion of whose names
from the List of Voters are prayed for therein, because notices of hearing have
been properly given by posting such notices at (a) <span class="SpellE">Cainta</span>
Municipal Building, (b) <span class="SpellE">Bining's</span> Barber Shop, New
Provincial Road, <span class="SpellE">Cainta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
and (c) Garcia's Sari-Sari Store, Wilson Street, <span class="SpellE">Cainta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1,
R.A. 5178 in conjunction with par. (b), Sec. 123 of the Revised Election Code,
and (4) considering that the motion to dismiss below hypothetically admits the
allegation of the petition, the Court RESOLVED:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) to grant the petition for <i>mandamus</i> herein and to declare
permanent the preliminary mandatory injunction issued by this Court on November
7, 1967; and (2) to direct respondent Judge to hear and promptly decide
aforesaid Election Cases Nos. 39 to 55, without costs.</p>
