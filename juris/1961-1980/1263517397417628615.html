				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by defendant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>,
from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, convicting him of the crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing
him to life imprisonment, as well as to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Lopez in the sum of P6,051.00 and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="7">July <span style="">9, </span>1965</st1:date>, the lifeless body
of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Lopez was found, in an advanced state of
decomposition, floating on the Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span> river, near
Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>, in the barrio of Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bago</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After making inquiries, Sgt. Claudio <span class="SpellE">Latido</span>,
of the local police force, learned from <span class="SpellE">Antero</span> <span class="SpellE">Loraina</span> that, a few days before, he had paid P45.00 for a
pig sold to him by Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> went to the house of Lopez - seemingly to ascertain
the whereabouts of the money -but found that the place had been ransacked and
that there were blood stains on the stairs and on a path leading to the river,
five (5) fathoms away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon further
inquiry, <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> was informed by Sergio <span class="SpellE">Teves</span> that two (2) fighting cocks and a hen belonging to
Lopez were then in the possession of appellant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> went to
the house of <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> <span style="">and </span>asked him what he knew about the death of Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
disclaimed any know­ledge about it, <span class="SpellE">Latido</span>
departed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before going up said house, <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> had, however, posted two (2) policemen below the
same, with in­structions to watch the place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon <span class="SpellE">Latido's</span> departure <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
the policemen overheard <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> tell his wife that
the killer of Lopez could not be caught.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although she replied:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"because you really killed him," <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
did not deny the imputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
policemen immediately reported this to <span class="SpellE">Latido</span>, who,
soon thereafter, picked up <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> and brought him
to the police station, in Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, he was taken to the Chief of
police, in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>,
to whom he admitted his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
typing <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla's</span> confession, the Chief of Police
brought him to the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, Hon.
Manuel H. <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span>, to whom <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
affirmed, under oath, that he had made it voluntarily and that the contents
thereof are true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Brought back,
thereafter, to the scene <span style="">of </span>the
oc­currence, appellant re-enacted the same in the presence of residents of the
locality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his confession,
appellant stated that on July 27 (meaning June 27) 1965, Lopez went to his
(appellant's) residence and took <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> two (2)
roosters he (Lopez) had previously sold to him (appellant) for P4.00, and </span>a
<span style="">hen, with eleven (11) chicks, Mrs.
Lopez had entrusted to his care, before leaving </span>for <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Negros</span></span><span style=""> Orien­tal; that, when he reminded Lopez that he (appellant) had
already paid for said roosters, he (Lopez) replied that the price thereof would
be refunded, and bade him (appellant) to go to his (Lopez') house, if he
(appellant) wanted to talk about it; that, accordingly, he (appellant) planned
to get back the roosters and his share of the chicks, without any intent of
killing Lopez; that, on July 29 (mean­ing June 29) 1965, he (appellant) went to
the house of Lopez at about 7 p.m.; that, after exchanging the usual greetings
with Lopez, who was in his yard, gathering firewood, appellant said that he had
come for the roosters; that, in reply thereto, Lopez re­marked that he
(appellant) wanted the roosters because he had paid very little <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and that its price would be reimbursed as soon as
he had the money; that this remark enraged him (ap­pellant), whereupon he took
hold of a piece of wood and struck Lopez with it, on the head; that, as Lopez
staggered to the ground, he (appellant) hit him again and again, until he
slumped down un­conscious; that, when he (appellant) noticed that Lopez was
dead </span>he dragged his body and tossed it into the river, after taking
P51.00 from a black leather wallet found in one of his pockets; that he,
likewise, threw into the river the piece of wood with which he had clubbed
Lopez, as well as said wallet and some papers; that, thereafter, he (appellant)
returned home and hid the money in an object made of bamboo; that, the next
day, he went back to the <span style="">residence of
Lopez, took <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the roosters, which were tied
under his (Lopez') house, and brought them to his (appellant's) home; and that,
on July 4, 1965, he lost said money playing "<span class="SpellE">monte</span>"
in the house of Pacing Sol, in Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span> testified that he
interviewed <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>, who narrated to him the
events leading to the killing of Lopez and swore that he had voluntarily made
the aforesaid confession and that the contents thereof are true.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denied having committed the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that, as he pleaded innocence, in the
police station at Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>, he was beaten up by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Latido</span>, until he (appellant) lost conscious­ness and
vomited blood; that, to avoid further suffering, which he could no longer
endure, he agreed, the next day, to anything de­manded of him by the police,
even to the point of groggily impli­cating Sergio <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
and Abraham <span class="SpellE">Labuyo</span> - who were, accordingly,
investigated and later released by the police - although he really did not know
whether or not they had had any participation in the killing of Lopez; that
when, thereafter, he was brought to the Chief of Police, in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, he (appellant)
admitted everything imputed to him; and that he similarly reiterated this
admission, still later, before Judge <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's wife, <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, declared that, when she saw him in the police
station at <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, there were contusions all over his
body and his clothes were blood stained; yet, <span style="">she </span>never told anybody about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, nobody, apart from her, much less a physician, has ever
examined or seen any of the contusions allegedly sustained by appellant,
although Judge <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span> - to whom he (appellant)
ratified the contents of his confession and swore to the truth thereof - would
not have failed to notice said contusions, had the same been as extensive as <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> would have Us
believe.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, the exculpatory matters incorporated into the
confession, such as appellant's alleged lack of intention to kill, when he went
to the residence of Lopez; the simple, natural and logical flaw of his narration
therein; the details given, such as the place where he kept the P51.00 he took
from the body of Lopez, and the fact that he (appellant) lost the money, on
July 4, 1965, playing "<span class="SpellE">monte</span>" in the house
of Pacing Sol, in Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>;
the mistakes committed in the confession, in mentioning July 27 and 29 as the
dates of events that had happened on June 27 and 29; and the fact that the
object used by appellant to kill Lopez was a piece of wood, according to said
confession - although the physician who examined the body of the deceased,
about a week before, stated that the latter had an incised wound, at the nape
of the neck, cut­ting important blood vessels and nerves that must have caused
death through severe hemorrhage - leave no room for doubt that <span style="">His Honor, the trial Judge, had not erred in
not believing the testi­mony of appellant and that of his wife; and that the
contents of said confession were not figments of the imagination of either Sgt.
<span class="SpellE">Latido</span> or the Chief of Police, to which appellant had
merely assented, and could not have been but freely and voluntarily supplied by
appellant himself, without any compulsion except that springing from his guilty
conscience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, there is an additional fact that conclusively belies his
claim of duress, and that is that the same was allegedly applied by Sgt. <span class="SpellE"><u>Latido</u></span> in <u>Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span></u>,
whereas the confession was taken by the <u>Chief of Police</u> in the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE"><u>Bago</u></span>, where,
apparently, <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> did not participate and was not
even present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was, seemingly,
so free from any duress in this place that he even claimed to have advised the
Chief of Police and Judge <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span> of the beating he
had allegedly received from <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> in Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally,
appellant's testimony to this effect merely reveals his lack of veracity, for Judge
<span class="SpellE">Javelona</span> affirmed that appellant had not only
declared under oath that his confession had been freely made and that its
contents are true, but, also, narrated the circumstances surrounding the
occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> denied having
laid hands upon appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, upon
his apprehension in the evening of <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1965</st1:date>, appellant was taken to the police station of Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>, where <span class="SpellE">Latido</span> <u>left</u> him,
on account of the high fever he then had, with instructions to the policemen on
duty there to bring appellant to the Chief of Police, in the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bago</span></st1:place></st1:city>, which they did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, appellant re­enacted the
commission of the crime in the presence of other persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">One point requires a clarification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The physician who examined the body of Lopez
said that he must have died in consequence of an incised wound in the nape of
the neck, but appellant's confession shows that he had merely clubbed
Lopez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This seeming contradic­tion was,
however, explained in the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The autopsy was performed when the body of
the deceased was in a very advanced state of decomposition, after having been
in the river for ten (10) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
Honor, the trial Judge surmised that said incised wound "might have been
caused by sharp objects," as the body was "carried by the current of
the river."</p>

<p class="BODY">Everything considered, We are satisfied that appellant's con­fession
is not tainted with duress and that he had killed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
Lopez in the manner stated in said confession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant thereto, his acts do not constitute, however, the special
complex crime of robbery with homicide of which he is accused, since his
purpose in going to the residence of Lopez and beating him to death was not to
steal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that he merely
wanted to get back the roosters be<span style="">longing
to him, for he had admittedly bought them from Lopez, who had been fully paid <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and had taken the roosters from appel­lant's house
without his consent and without refunding its price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sum of P51.00 was taken by appellant,
when he found it in one of the pockets of Lopez, before tossing his dead body
into the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
thought of carrying away said amount came <u>after</u> the killing had been
consummated, and as a mere incident of the task of disposing of or concealing
the corpse of the victim.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot even convict appellant of the crime of robbery,
separately from said killing, the only evidence on the appropriation and taking
away of the aforementioned sum of P51.00 being his confession, which is not
corroborated by evidence of the <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>,
insofar as said amount is concerned, inasmuch as the same has never been found,
he having lost it in gambling, according to his confession, and, independently
thereof, there is no evidence of its presence in the body of Lopez, at the time
of the occurrence.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a consequence,
appellant is merely guilty of homicide, and, no modifying circumstance having
attended its commission, he should be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of
from 8 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> </span><u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">to 14 years, 8 months
and 1 day of <u>reclusion</u> </span><u><span style="">temporal</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">with the corresponding accessory penalties, and to indemnify the heirs
of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Lopez in the sum of P12,000,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> with­out subsidiary imprisonment, in view of
the nature of the principal penalty.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus modified</span>, as
to the characterization of the crime com­mitted, and the penalty, as well as
the indemnity <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, the de­cision appealed from
should be, as it <span style="">is, </span>accordingly,
affirmed, in all other respects, with costs against appellant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>.</p>
