<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In 1950 the Commonwealth 
Insurance Co., a domestic corporation, entered into reinsurance contracts with 
32 British insurance companies not engaged in trade or business in the 
Philippines, whereby the former agreed to cede to them a portion of the premiums 
on insurances on fire, marine and other risks it has underwritten in the 
Philippines. Alexander <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; Co., Ltd., also a 
British corporation not engaged in business in this country, represented the 
aforesaid British insurance companies. The reinsurance contracts were prepared 
and signed by the foreign <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> in 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and sent to 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> where Commonwealth Insurance Co. 
signed them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Pursuant to the aforesaid 
contracts, Commonwealth insurance </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Co.</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, in 1951, remitted P798<span class="GramE">,297.47</span> to Alexander <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; 
Co., Ltd., as reinsurance premiums. In behalf of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; Co., Ltd., Commonwealth Insurance Co. filed in 
April 1952 an income tax return declaring the sum of P798<span class="GramE">,297.47</span>, with accrued interest thereon in the amount of 
P4,985.77, as Alexander <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; Co., <span class="SpellE">Ltd.'s</span> gross income for calendar year 1951. It paid the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue P66<span class="GramE">,l12.00</span> as tax thereon. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On May 12, 1954, within the 
two-year period provided law, Alexander <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; 
Co., Ltd., filed with the of Internal Revenue a claim for refund of the 
P66,112.00, later reduced to P65,115.00, because Alexander <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; Co., Ltd., agreed to the payment of P997.00 as 
income tax on the P4,985.77 accrued interest. A ruling of the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue, dated </span><st1:date month="12" day="8" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 8, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was 
invoked, stating that it exempted from withholding tax reinsurance premiums 
received from domestic insurance companies by foreign insurance companies, not 
authorized to do business in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Subsequently, Alexander <span class="SpellE">Howden</span> &amp; Co., Ltd. Instituted an action in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila for the recovery of the aforesaid amount claimed. 
Pursuant to Section 22 of Republic Act 1125 the case was certified to the Court 
of Tax Appeals. On </span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 24, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
Tax Court denied the claim. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Plaintiffs have appealed, thereby 
squarely raising the following issues: (1) Are portions of premiums earned from 
insurances locally underwritten by a domestic corporation, ceded to and received 
by non-resident foreign reinsurance companies, thru a non-resident foreign 
insurance broker, pursuant to reinsurance contracts signed by the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> abroad but signed by the domestic corporation in 
the Philippines, subject to income tax or not? (2) If subject thereto, may or 
may not the income tax on reinsurance premiums be withheld pursuant to Sections 
53 and 54 of the National Internal Revenue Code? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Section 24 of 
the National Internal Revenue Code subjects to tax a non-resident foreign 
corporation's income from sources within the 
</span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> The first issue therefore hinges 
on whether or not the reinsurance premium in question came from sources within 
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellant would impress' upon 
this Court that the reinsurance premiums came from sources outside the 
Philippines, for these reasons: (1) The contracts of reinsurance, out of which 
the reinsurance premiums were earned; were prepared and signed abroad, so that 
their <span class="SpellE">situs</span> lies outside the Philippines; (2) The 
<span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>, not engaged in business in the 
Philippines, received the insurance premiums as income from their business 
conducted in England and, as such, taxable in England; and, (3) Section 37 of 
the Tax Code, enumerating what are income from sources within the Philippines, 
does not include reinsurance premiums. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The source of an income is the 
property, activity or service that produced the income.<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> The reinsurance premiums remitted to 
appellants by virtue of the reinsurance contracts, accordingly, had for their 
source the under- taking to indemnify Commonwealth Insurance Co. against 
liability. Said undertaking is the activity that produced the reinsurance 
premiums, and the same took place in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. In the first place, the 
reinsured, the liabilities insured and the risks originally underwritten by 
Commonwealth Insurance Co., upon which the reinsurance premiums and indemnity 
were based, were all situated in the Philippines. Secondly, contrary to 
appellants' view, the reinsurance contracts were perfected in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, for Commonwealth Insurance Co. 
signed them last in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The American cases cited are 
inapplicable to this case because in all of them the reinsurance contracts were 
signed outside the jurisdiction of the taxing State. And, thirdly, the parties 
to the reinsurance contracts in question evidently intended Philippine law to 
govern. Article 11 thereof provided for arbitration in 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, according to the laws of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, of any dispute arising between 
the parties in regard to the integration of said contracts or rights in respect 
of any transaction involved. Furthermore, the contracts provided for the use of 
Philippine currency as the medium of exchange and for the payment of Philippine 
taxes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants should not confuse 
<i>activity</i> that creates in come with <i>business</i> in the course of which 
an income is realized. An activity may consist of a single act; while business 
implies continuity of transactions<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">2]</span></sup> An income may be earned by a corporation in 
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> although such corporation 
conducts all its <i>business</i> abroad. Precisely, Section 24 of the Tax Code 
does not require a foreign corporation to be engaged in business in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, in order for its income from 
sources within the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to be taxable. It subjects 
foreign corporations not doing business in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to tax for income from sources 
within the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. If by source of income is meant 
the business of the taxpayer, foreign corporations not engaged in business in 
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> would be exempt from taxation on 
their income from sources within the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Furthermore, as used in our 
income tax law, "income" refers to the flow of wealth<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">3]</span></sup> Such flow, in the instant case, proceeded 
from the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Such income enjoyed the 
protection of the Philippine government. As wealth flowing from within the 
taxing jurisdiction of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and in consideration for 
protection accorded it by the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, said income should properly 
share the burden of maintaining the government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants further contend that 
reinsurance premiums not being among those mentioned in Section 37 of the Tax 
Code as income from sources within the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the same should not be treated 
as such. Section 37, however, is not an all-inclusive enumeration. It states 
that the following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sources 
within the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">". It does state or imply that an 
income not listed therein is necessarily from sources outside the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to appellants, contention that 
reinsurance premiums constitute "gross receipts" instead of "gross income", not 
subject to income tax, suffice it to say that, as correctly observed by the 
Court of Tax Appeals, "gross receipts" of amounts that do not constitute return 
of capital, such as reinsurance premiums; are part of the gross income of a 
taxpayer. At any rate, the tax actually collected in this case was computed not 
on the basis of gross premium receipts but on the net premium income that is, 
after deducting general expenses, payment of policies and taxes. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The reinsurance premiums in 
question being taxable, we turn to the issues whether or not they are subject to 
withholding tax under Section 54 in relation to Section 53 of the Tax Code. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Subsection (b) of Section 53 
subjects to withholding tax the following: interest, dividends, rents, salaries, 
wages, <i>premiums</i>, annuities, compensation, remunerations, emoluments, 
<i>or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and 
income</i> of any non-resident alien individual not engaged in trade or business 
within the Philippines and not having any office or place of business therein. 
Section 54, by reference, applies this provision to <i>foreign corporations not 
engaged in trade or business in the 
</i></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></i></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants maintain that 
reinsurance premiums are not "premiums" at all as contemplated by Subsection (b) 
of Section 53 j that they are not within the scope of "other fixed or 
determinable annual or periodical gains, profits and income"; that, therefore, 
they are not items of income Object to withholding tax. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The argument of appellants is 
that "premiums”, as used in Section 53(b), is preceded by "rents, salaries, 
wages” and followed by "annuities, compensations, remunerations" which connote 
periodical income payable to the recipient on account of some investment or for 
personal services rendered. "Premiums" should, therefore, in appellants' view, 
be given a meaning kindred to the other terms in the enumeration and be 
understood in its broadest sense as "a reward or recompense for some act done; a 
bonus; compensation for the use of money; a price for a loan; a sum in addition 
to interest". <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We disagree with the foregoing 
proposition. Since Section 63 subjects to withholding tax various specified 
income, among them, "premiums", the generic connotation of each and every word 
or phrase composing the enumeration in Subsection (b) thereof is income. 
Perforce, the word "premiums", which is neither qualified nor defined by the law 
itself, should mean income and should include all premiums constituting income, 
whether they <span class="GramE">be</span> insurance or reinsurance premiums. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Assuming that reinsurance 
premiums are not within the word "premiums" in Section 53, still they may be 
classified as <i>determinable and periodical income</i> under the same provision 
of law. Section 199 of the Income Tax Regulations defines fixed, determinable, 
annual and periodical income: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Income is fixed when it is to be 
paid in amounts definitely predetermined. On the other hand, it is determinable 
whenever there is a basis of calculation by which the amount to be paid may be 
ascertained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The income need not be paid 
annually if it is paid periodically; that is to say, from time to time, whether 
or not at regular intervals. That the length of time during which the payments 
are to be made may be increased or diminished in accordance with someone's will 
or with the happening of an event does not make the payments any the less 
determinable or periodical. * * *"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Reinsurance premiums, therefore, 
are determinable an periodical income; determinable, because they can be 
calculated accurately on the basis of the reinsurance contracts; periodical, 
inasmuch as they were earned and remitted from time to time. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants' claim for refund, as 
stated, invoked a ruling: the Commissioner of Internal Revenue dated 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="8" year="1953"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 8, 
1953</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Appellants' brief also cited rulings of the same official, dated October 13, 
1953, February 7, 1955 and February 8, 1955, as well as the decision of the 
defunct Board of Tax Appeals in the case of Franklin Baker Co<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">4]</span></sup>, thereby attempting to show that the 
prevailing administrative interpretation of Sections 53 and 54 of the Tax Code 
exempted from withholding tax reinsurance premiums ceded to non-resident foreign 
insurance companies. It is asserted that since Sections 53 and 54 were 
"substantially re-enacted" by Republic Acts 1065 (approved </span><st1:date month="6" day="12" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 12, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), 
1291 (approved </span><st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 15, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">), 
1505 (approved </span><st1:date month="6" day="16" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 16, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">) and 
2343 (approved </span><st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 20, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">) 
when the said administrative rulings <span class="GramE">prevailed,</span> the 
rulings should be given the force of law under the principle of legislative 
approval by re-enactment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The principle of legislative 
approval by re-enactment may briefly be stated thus: When a statute is 
susceptible of the meaning placed upon it by a ruling of the government agency 
charged with its enforcement and the Legislature thereafter re-enacts the 
provisions with substantial change, such action is to some extent confirmatory 
that the ruling carries out the legislative purpose<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">5]</span></sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The afore-stated principle, 
however, is not applicable to this case. Firstly, Sections 53 and 54 were never 
re- enacted. Republic Acts 1065, 1291, 1505 and 2343 were <i>merely amendments 
in respect to the rate of tax</i> imposed in Sections 53 and 54. Secondly, the 
administrative rulings the Commissioner of Internal Revenue relied upon' by 
taxpayers were only contained in letters to taxpayers and never published, so 
that the Legislature is not presumed to know said rulings. Thirdly, in the case 
on which appellants rely, <span class="SpellE">Interprovincial</span> Autobus Co., 
Inc. vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, 98 Phil. 290, January 31, 1956, what was 
declared to have acquired the force and effect of law was a <i>regulation</i> 
promulgated to implement a law; whereas, in this case, what appellant would seek 
to have the force of law are opinions on queries submitted. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It may not be amiss to note that 
in 1963, after the Tax Court rendered judgment in this case, Congress enacted 
Republic Act 3825, as an amendment to Sections 24 and 54 of the Tax Code, 
exempting from income taxes and withholding tax, reinsurance premiums received 
by foreign corporations not engaged in business in the Philippines. Republic Act 
3825 <i>in effect took out</i> from Sections 24 and 54 something which formed a 
part of the subject matter therein<span class="GramE">,<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">6]</span></sup> thereby affirming the taxability of 
reinsurance premiums prior to the afore-stated amendment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, appellant would argue 
that Judge <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>, who penned the <span class="GramE">decision</span> 
appealed from, was disqualified to sit in this case since he had appeared as 
counsel for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and, as such, answered 
plaintiffs' complaint before the Court of First Instance of Manila. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Rules of Court provides that 
no judge shall sit in any case in which he has been counsel without the written 
consent of all the parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the 
record. The party objecting to the judge's competency may file, in writing, with 
such judge his objection, stating therein the grounds for it. The judge shall 
thereupon proceed with the trial or with draw <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, but his action shall be made in writing and made 
part of the record<span class="GramE">.<sup><span style="color: red;">[</span></sup></span><sup><span style="color: red;">7]</span></sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants, instead of asking for 
Judge <span class="SpellE">Luciano's</span> disqualification by raising their 
objection in the Court of Tax Appeals, are content to raise it for the <i>first 
time</i> before this Court. Such being the case they may not now be heard to 
complain on this point, when Judge <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> has given 
his opinion on the merits of the case. A litigant cannot be permitted to
