				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner San Pablo Oil Factory, Inc. - hereinafter referred to
as the Factory - seeks the review of an order of the Court of Industrial
Relations - hereinafter refer­red to <span style="">as
</span>the CIR.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision rendered, on April 30, 1963, in <span style="">G. </span>R. No. L-18270, entitled "San
Pablo Oil Factory, Inc. and Werner P. Schetelig vs. Court of Industrial
Relations and Kapatirang Manggagawa Association (NLU)", the Supreme Court
affirmed a resolution of the CIR sitting <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style="">, </span>in ULP
Case No. 1350, finding the Factory guilty of dis­criminatory lockout and
directing it to reinstate the workers concerned<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
with "back wages corresponding to the period of their unemployment as a
result" of said lock­out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August
29, 1963, the Kapatirang Manggagawa Associa­tion (NLU) - hereinafter referred
to as the Union - which was the petitioner in said unfair labor practice case
and of which the aforementioned workers were members - moved for the execution
of the aforementioned resolution, insofar as it directed the payment of back
wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on this motion, on October
9, 1963, Judge Tabigne of the CIR ordered its Examiner and Economist to
determine and compute said back wages, "using as a basis x x x the wages
actual­ly earned by other employees and/or workers, doing the same kind of
work, who have not been dismissed".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On motion for reconsideration, filed by the Union, on January 23, 1964,
the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, with Judge Tabigne dissenting, set aside his
aforesaid order, and directed that the back wages in question be computed on
the basis of "any sum which they (the employees and/or laborers involved)
should have earn­ed had they not been dismissed", because "what other
work­ers received in that abnormal operation is immaterial."</p>

<p class="BODY">In pursuance of this resolution, the CIR Chief Exami­ner reported
that - based upon the basic wage per day of the workers concerned immediately
prior to their lockout, multiplied by the 85-working days from May 27 to
September 8, 1957 - which was the duration of the lockout - the ag­gregate
amount due to them was P54,132.25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Factory having objected to this report, Judge Tabigne ordered the CIR Examiner,
on November 9, 1964, to examine the produc­tion records of the Factory
"for the purpose of determin­ing the total number of days during the
period" aforemen­tioned, "when the Factory actually operated and
milled." Soon thereafter, the examiner reported that the Factory had
"actually operated and milled and produced oil and copra cake for a total
of 39 days".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstand­ing,
Judge Tabigne, acting in compliance with the reso­lution of the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
dated January 23, 1964, adopt­ed the 85 calendar working days as the basis for
the com­putation of the back wages in question, and, after deduct­ing the
amounts sought to be collected by some laborers who had not been locked out,
and the earnings of other laborers during the lay-off period, ordered the
Factory to deposit with the CIR the sum of P50,790.20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion for reconsideration of the Factory,
this order was affirm­ed by the CIR <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal, in which the only question raised is whether
the aforementioned back wages should be comput­ed on the basis of the working
days - that is to say, excluding legal holidays - during the period of the
lockout, as contended by the Union, or should be limited to the thirty-nine
(39) days in which the Factory was actually in operation, during the same
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious to us that the latter alternative is the correct
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, even if there had been no
lock­out, the laborers in question could not have possibly work­ed when the
Factory was not in actual operation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They could not have earned any wages except for the days of said actual
operation, it being seemingly conceded that they had no month­ly salary, but
were paid a daily wage for services actually rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it being undisputed that the Factory was
not actually operated and did not mill except during the afore­mentioned
thirty-nine (39) days, the order and the resolu­tion appealed from and the
aggregate amount of the award should be, respectively, modified and reduced,
accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>With this modification</b>, said order and resolution are
hereby affirmed, in all other respects, without special pro­nouncement as to
costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
