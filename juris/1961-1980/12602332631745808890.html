				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Hon. Froilan 
Bayona, presiding, dismissing a petition filed by Bernardo Sebastian, to 
prohibit the respondents Juan N. Gerardo, hearing officer of Regional Office No. 
3. Department of Labor, and Crispin Selosa, from hearing and deciding a 
complaint filed by Selosa against Sebastian for collection of overtime pay.
<p>Respondent-appellee Crispin Selosa, claiming to be employed by 
petitioner-appellant Bernardo Sebastian as a helper mechanic from February 2, 
1955 up to November 20, 1956, at a daily wage of P4.00, instituted a complaint 
(docketed as R03-c7334, LS-1102) with Regional Office No. 3. for collection of 
overtime pay. After an answer thereto was filed by petitioner Sebastian and a 
hearing conducted thereon by respondent Hearing Officer Juan N. Gerardo. the 
latter rendered a decision awarding respondent Selosa the sum of P850.37, with 
interest thereon until fully paid.</p>
<p>Thereupon petitioner Sebastian filed with the Court of First Instance of 
Manila the instant petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction (docketed 
in that court as Civil Case No. 39120). wherein he prayed that the proceedings 
before the Hearing Officer of Regional Office No. 3 on the claim of Selosa 
against him be declared null and void. By way of provisional remedy, he asked 
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to stay the execution of 
the decision of the hearing officer. On February 20, 1959, respondent hearing 
officer moved to dismiss the petition, on the ground that it states no cause of 
action, there being no allegation that Plan No. 20-A is void or 
unconstitutional, nor of abuse of discretion on the part of respondent hearing 
officer.</p>
<p>Acting upon said motion to dismiss, the lower court on June 8, 1959 dismissed 
the case, on the ground that petitioner has not appealed from the decision of 
Regional Office No. 3 to the Labor Standards Commission, in accordance with Sec. 
12, Article 3 of Republic Act No. 997, as amended by Republic Act No. 1241 and 
Plan No. 20-A. After the denial of a motion for reconsideration of the order 
which he filed, petitioner appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>Before this Court, petitioner-appellant claims that the lower court erred in 
dismissing the petition for certiorari for his failure to comply with Sec. 12, 
Article 3, Plan No. 20-A and in not holding that regional offices have no 
jurisdiction to hear and decide a case such as the present.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from must be reversed. In cases recently decided by us 
(Jose Corominas, Jr., et al. <em>vs</em>. Labor Standards Commission, et al., 
Manila Central University <em>vs</em>. Calupitan, et al., Wong Chun <em>vs</em>. 
Diego Carlim, et al., Balrodgan Co., Ltd., et al., <em>vs</em>. Fuentes et al., 
<em>supra</em>, p. 551) we have decided that the provision of Reorganization 
Plan No. 20-A especially Section 25, which grants regional offices original and 
exclusive jurisdiction to consider money claims, including overtime pay, under 
payment, pay for Sundays and legal holidays, etc., is not authorized by the 
provisions of Republic Act No. 997, which creates and grants power to the 
Reorganization Commission. We expressly held that the legislature could not have 
contemplated a grant of power to the Reorganization Commission to take away the 
jurisdiction over money claims from ordinary courts of justice to the regional 
offices established by the Commission. The ruling of the lower court that the 
regional offices had no jurisdiction to consider the claim of Crispin Selosa is, 
therefore, correct.</p>
<p>However, its order dismissing the petition on the ground that Sebastian had 
not appealed from the decision of the regional office to the Labor Standards 
Commission, is incorrect. If the regional Office had no jurisdiction to hear and 
consider the claim of Crispin Selosa, all proceedings held in said regional 
office concerning the said claim are null and void and it is not necessary for 
Sebastian to appeal first to the Labor Standards Commission to question the 
jurisdiction of the said regional office before filing his action in the court 
below. An objection to the jurisdiction of a hearing officer is not waived by 
failure to raise the issue on an appeal therefrom and can be raised at any time 
before courts of justice.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the proceedings before and judgment by the regional office are 
hereby set aside. With costs against respondent Crispin Selosa. So 
ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</em> and <em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
