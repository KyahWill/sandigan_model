				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Go Siu Gui, a Chinese citizen, arrived in the Philippines on October
3, 1948. Admitted as a temporary visitor, he was originally allowed to stay in
the country up to October 3, 1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he overstayed, the Second Deputy Commissioner of Immigration issued a warrant
for his arrest on October 14, 1949.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, upon his posting of additional cash bonds his stay here was
extended to December 3, 1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
able to obtain several other extensions, the last of which expired in February
1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, in a decision dated
June 9, 1950 the Com­missioner of <span style="">Immigration
- </span>acting upon the recommendation of a board of special inquiry - ordered
the deportation of Go Siu Gui on the first available transportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the order of deportation remained unexecuted, defendant
Republic Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. posted on November 24, 1950 a
P7,000.00 surety bond in favor of <span style="">the Commissioner of Immigration for the <u>temporary
admission into the Philippines</u> of Go Siu Gui.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, nothing significant appears to
have been done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with respect to his
deportation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Almost nine (9) years
later, on July 16, 1959, the Commissioner of </span><span style="">Immigration </span><span style="">sent a letter to the Surety to produce the person of Go Siu Gui at the
Bureau of Immigra­tion within forty-eight </span><span style="">(48) </span><span style="">hours, otherwise the bond would be declared forfeited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 24, 1959, the surety having failed to
comply within th</span><span style="">e</span><span style=""> time limit, the Commis­sioner
of Immigration gave it notice that the bond was con­fiscated, and requested
that it remit the amount of P7,000. 00 within 72 hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the surety </span><span style="">failed </span><span style="">to comply, and on February 2, 1960 suit for
the recovery of the amount was </span><span style="">instituted </span><span style="">by the plaintiff in the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One month later, or on March 11, 1960, the
defendant actually surrendered the person of the principal to the Commissioner
of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the pendency of
the case and before the plaintiff could conclude the presentation of its
evidence, the then acting Commissioner, Agapito R. Conchu, issued an order
dated March 24, 1962, declaring the </span><span style="">bond posted </span><span style="">by the defendant null and void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u> and therefore
considered the same </span><span style="">cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span style="">said official reasoned out:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 40(a) <span style="">of </span>the
Immigration Law does not authorize the Commissioner of Immigration to accept a
bond for the temporary liberty of a person already ordered deported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows therefore that the bond posted by
the Republic Surety &amp; Insurance Co. for the temporary stay of Go Siu Gui
was null and void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it could not be accepted according to the <span style="">law, </span>no action against it could later
be take; by the Commissioner of Immigration who was duty bound to know whether
or not <span style="">he was empowered </span>to
approve and accept said bond which, under Section 40(a) of <span style="">the Im­migration Law of 1940, </span>he was
not authorized to accept."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As
</span><span style="">a consequence of the above order
</span><span style="">of c</span><span style="">ancellation, defendant moved to dismiss the
complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
</span><span style="">lower
court granted the motion in a decision dated </span><span style="">December 5, </span><span style="">1962, the dispositive portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the bond having been cancelled by the Commissioner
of Immigration which in effect sets aside the order of confiscation, the action
is hereby dismissed without pronounce­ment as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
the present appeal by the Republic, the Solicitor General assails the validity
of the order of the acting Commissioner of Immigration declaring the bond null
and void on the ground that it had not been approved by the Secretary of
Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No </span><span style="">law, </span><span style="">however, is cited which expressly requires such approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3 of the Immigration Act of 1949 is
invoked, but it refers to the power and duty of the Commissioner "to
issue, subject to the approval of the Department Head, such rules and
regulations and prescribe such forms of bond ... and shall issue from time to
time such instructions, not inconsistent with laws, as he shall deem best
calculated to carry out the provisions of the Immigration Laws."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of their nature, the
matters-contemplated in this section, being of general ap­plication, are made
subject to the approval of the Department Head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But not isolated acts or decisions of the Com­missioner in individual
cases, which are covered by the other portion of the same Section 3 of the
Immigration Law giving the Commissioner charge of the administration of all
laws relating to the immigration of aliens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Essentially
the conflict in this case stems from a misapprehension of the true import of
the surety bond in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
entitled </span><u><span style="">Surety Bond For
Temporary Stay</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and was posted - as
paragraph No. 1 thereof categorically states - for the temporary admission into
the Philippines of Go Siu Gui, a Chinese citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But considering that as early as June 9, 1950
(the surety bond </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">dated November 24, 1950) Go Siu Gui had
already been ordered deported, al­though execution of the order had been
deferred meanwhile for reasons not appearing clearly in the record, the primary
purpose for which exhibit "A" was posted could not have been served
at all by said surety bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><span style="">terms and
conditions of the surety bond negate plaintiff's assertion that it was a bond
to secure Go Siu Gui's release from his detention cell while awaiting deport­ation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surety undertook, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>... to make Go Siu Gui at all times available
to and to present him within 24 hours after receipt of notice to produce before
the immigration authori­ties for investigation of his right to further stay in
the Philippines;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in case Go Siu Gui, after such inquiry is
found to have violated any limitation or condition under which he was admitted
as non-immigrant and is sub­ject to deportation (the surety) under­takes to produce
him for deportation within 24 hours after receipt of demand to do so;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the undersigned (surety) also-undertakes
that the surety bond shall respond for the expenses incurred in con­nection
with the expulsion of Go Siu <u>if he is found deportable</u>, x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These conditions are quite clear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere is there any indication that when the surety filed the bond it
was aware that Go Siu Gui had in fact already been ordered de­ported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering paragraph (e) in particular the
surety could not have intended to assume responsibility over the person of Go
Siu Gui pending actual deportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was evidently of the belief that the question of deportation <span style="">was </span>still open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise the terms of the bond should have
been worded differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The condition
upon which the surety's obligation was based, namely, if the principal should
be found deportable, was a useless one since the deportability of the principal
was already a closed matter,and therefore should not give rise to the
conditional obligation at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on grounds of equity the dismissal of the complaint is
justifiable, since after all the defendant surrendered its principal soon after
the suit was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The short delay
could not have materially prejudiced the interests of the plaintiff,
considering its own inaction to implement the order of deportation for <span style="">a </span>period of nine years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
